<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where's the Poet? show him! show him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muses nine! that I may know him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis the man who with a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is an equal, be he King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or poorest of the beggar-clan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or any other wonderous thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man may be 'twixt ape and Plato;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis the man who with a bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wren or Eagle, finds his way to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its instincts; he hath heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion's roaring, and can tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What his horny throat expresseth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to him the Tiger's yell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come articulate and presseth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or his ear like mother-tongue.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are too ready with complaint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this fair world of God's. Had we no hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed beyond the zenith and the slope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of yon gray blank of sky, we might grow faint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To muse upon eternity's constraint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round our aspirant souls; but since the scope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must widen early, is it well to droop,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a few days consumed in loss and taint?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O pusillanimous Heart, be comforted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like a cheerful traveller, take the road
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing beside the hedge. What if the bread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be bitter in thine inn, and thou unshod
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the flints? At least it may be said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because the way is short, I thank thee, God.'

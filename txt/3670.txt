<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If truth in hearts that perish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could move the powers on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the love I bear you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should make you not to die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, sure, if stedfast meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If single thought could save,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world might end to-morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should not see the grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This long and sure-set liking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This boundless will to please,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Oh, you should live for ever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were help in these.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, since all is idle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this lost heart be kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere to a town you journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where friends are ill to find.

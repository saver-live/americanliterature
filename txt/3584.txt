<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There pass the careless people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That call their souls their own:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here by the road I loiter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How idle and alone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, past the plunge of plummet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In seas I cannot sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart and soul and senses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World without end, are drowned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His folly has not fellow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the blue of day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gives to man or woman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart and soul away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There flowers no balm to sain him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From east of earth to west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's lost for everlasting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart out of his breast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here by the labouring highway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With empty hands I stroll:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-deep, till doomsday morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie lost my heart and soul.

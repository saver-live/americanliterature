<p>AGE after age the fruit of knowledge falls<br> To ashes on men's lips;<br> Love fails, faith sickens, like a dying tree<br> Life sheds its dreams that no new spring recalls;<br> The longed-for ships<br> Come empty home or founder on the deep,<br> And eyes first lose their tears and then their sleep.<br> <br> So weary a world it lies, forlorn of day,<br> And yet not wholly dark,<br> Since evermore some soul that missed the mark<br> Calls back to those agrope<br> In the mad maze of hope,<br> "Courage, my brothers—I have found the way!"<br> <br> The day is lost? What then?<br> What though the straggling rear-guard of the fight<br> Be whelmed in fear and night,<br> And the flying scouts proclaim<br> That death has gripped the van—<br> Ever the heart of man<br> Cheers on the hearts of men!<br> <br> <i>"It hurts not!"</i> dying cried the Roman wife;<br> And one by one<br> The leaders in the strife<br> Fall on the blade of failure and exclaim:<br> "The day is won!"</p>

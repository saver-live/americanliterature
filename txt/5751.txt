&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft through the silent air descend the feathery snow-flakes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White are the distant hills, white are the neighboring fields;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the marshes are brown, and the river rolling among them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weareth the leaden hue seen in the eyes of the blind.

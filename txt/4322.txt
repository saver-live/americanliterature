<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-mindedness, a jealousy for good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loving-kindness for the great man's fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwells here and there with people of no name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In noisome alley, and in pathless wood:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where we think the truth least understood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft may be found a "singleness of aim,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ought to frighten into hooded shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A money-mongering, pitiable brood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How glorious this affection for the cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of steadfast genius, toiling gallantly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What when a stout unbending champion awes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envy and malice to their native sty?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnumbered souls breathe out a still applause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud to behold him in his country's eye.

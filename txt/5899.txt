<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KAMBALU

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the city of Kambalu,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the road that leadeth to Ispahan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the head of his dusty caravan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laden with treasure from realms afar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baldacca and Kelat and Kandahar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode the great captain Alau.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Khan from his palace-window gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw in the thronging street beneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the setting sun, that blazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the clouds of dust by the caravan raised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flash of harness and jewelled sheath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shining scymitars of the guard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weary camels that bared their teeth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they passed and passed through the gates unbarred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the shade of the palace-yard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus into the city of Kambalu
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode the great captain Alau;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he stood before the Khan, and said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemies of my lord are dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Kalifs of all the West
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow and obey thy least behest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plains are dark with the mulberry-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weavers are busy in Samarcand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miners are sifting the golden sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divers plunging for pearls in the seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And peace and plenty are in the land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baldacca's Kalif, and he alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose in revolt against thy throne:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His treasures are at thy palace-door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the swords and the shawls and the jewels he wore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is dust o'er the desert blown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A mile outside of Baldacca's gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left my forces to lie in wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concealed by forests and hillocks of sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forward dashed with a handful of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lure the old tiger from his den
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the ambush I had planned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere we reached the town the alarm was spread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we heard the sound of gongs from within;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with clash of cymbals and warlike din
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates swung wide; and we turned and fled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the garrison sallied forth and pursued,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gray old Kalif at their head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above them the banner of Mohammed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we snared them all, and the town was subdued.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As in at the gate we rode, behold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tower that is called the Tower of Gold!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there the Kalif had hidden his wealth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaped and hoarded and piled on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sacks of wheat in a granary;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thither the miser crept by stealth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel of the gold that gave him health,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to gaze and gloat with his hungry eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On jewels that gleamed like a glow-worm's spark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the eyes of a panther in the dark.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said to the Kalif: 'Thou art old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast no need of so much gold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shouldst not have heaped and hidden it here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the breath of battle was hot and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But have sown through the land these useless hoards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spring into shining blades of swords,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep thine honor sweet and clear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These grains of gold are not grains of wheat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bars of silver thou canst not eat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These jewels and pearls and precious stones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot cure the aches in thy bones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor keep the feet of Death one hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From climbing the stairways of thy tower!'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then into his dungeon I locked the drone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him to feed there all alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the honey-cells of his golden hive:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never a prayer, nor a cry, nor a groan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heard from those massive walls of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor again was the Kalif seen alive!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When at last we unlocked the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We found him dead upon the floor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rings had dropped from his withered hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His teeth were like bones in the desert sands:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still clutching his treasure he had died;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he lay there, he appeared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statue of gold with a silver beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arms outstretched as if crucified."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the story, strange and true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the great captain Alau
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told to his brother the Tartar Khan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he rode that day into Kambalu
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the road that leadeth to Ispahan.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought before your tale began,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student murmured, "we should have
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some legend written by Judah Rav
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Gemara of Babylon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or something from the Gulistan,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tale of the Cazy of Hamadan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of that King of Khorasan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who saw in dreams the eyes of one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had a hundred years been dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still moving restless in his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undimmed, and gleaming with the lust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of power, though all the rest was dust.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But lo! your glittering caravan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road that leadeth to Ispahan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath led us farther to the East
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the regions of Cathay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spite of your Kalif and his gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant has been the tale you told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full of color; that at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will question or gainsay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet on such a dismal day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a merrier tale to clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark and heavy atmosphere.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So listen, Lordlings, while I tell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a preface, what befell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple cobbler, in the year --
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter; it was long ago;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is all we need to know."

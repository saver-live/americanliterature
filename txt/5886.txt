<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing, O Song of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the happy days that followed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Ojibways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant land and peaceful!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing the mysteries of Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing the Blessing of the Cornfields!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried was the bloody hatchet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried was the dreadful war-club,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried were all warlike weapons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the war-cry was forgotten.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was peace among the nations;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmolested roved the hunters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built the birch canoe for sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught the fish in lake and river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot the deer and trapped the beaver;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmolested worked the women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made their sugar from the maple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathered wild rice in the meadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed the skins of deer and beaver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around the happy village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the maize-fields, green and shining,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved the green plumes of Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved his soft and sunny tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the land with plenty.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the women who in Spring-time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planted the broad fields and fruitful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried in the earth Mondamin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the women who in Autumn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped the yellow husks of harvest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped the garments from Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as Hiawatha taught them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, when all the maize was planted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha, wise and thoughtful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake and said to Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his wife, the Laughing Water:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shall bless to-night the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw a magic circle round them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect them from destruction,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blast of mildew, blight of insect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagemin, the thief of cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paimosaid, who steals the maize-ear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the night, when all is silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, when all is darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuts the doors of all the wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that not an ear can hear you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that not an eye can see you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise up from your bed in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay aside your garments wholly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk around the fields you planted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the borders of the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered by your tresses only,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robed with darkness as a garment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus the fields shall be more fruitful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the passing of your footsteps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw a magic circle round them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that neither blight nor mildew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither burrowing worm nor insect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall pass o'er the magic circle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the dragon-fly, Kwo-ne-she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the spider, Subbekashe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the mighty caterpillar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Way-muk-kwana, with the bear-skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King of all the caterpillars!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tree-tops near the cornfields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the hungry crows and ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his band of black marauders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they laughed at Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the tree-tops shook with laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their melancholy laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the words of Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hear him!" said they; "hear the Wise Man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the plots of Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the noiseless night descended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad and dark o'er field and forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mournful Wawonaissa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrowing sang among the hemlocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut the doors of all the wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her bed rose Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid aside her garments wholly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with darkness clothed and guarded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unashamed and unaffrighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked securely round the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew the sacred, magic circle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her footprints round the cornfields.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one but the Midnight only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw her beauty in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one but the Wawonaissa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the panting of her bosom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guskewau, the darkness, wrapped her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closely in his sacred mantle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that none might see her beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that none might boast, "I saw her!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morrow, as the day dawned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathered all his black marauders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crows and blackbirds, jays and ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clamorous on the dusky tree-tops,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And descended, fast and fearless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fields of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grave of the Mondamin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will drag Mondamin," said they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the grave where he is buried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spite of all the magic circles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing Water draws around it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spite of all the sacred footprints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnehaha stamps upon it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wary Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever thoughtful, careful, watchful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had o'erheard the scornful laughter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they mocked him from the tree-tops.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaw!" he said, "my friends the ravens!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, my King of Ravens!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will teach you all a lesson
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall not be soon forgotten!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had risen before the daybreak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had spread o'er all the cornfields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snares to catch the black marauders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was lying now in ambush
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the neighboring grove of pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the crows and blackbirds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the jays and ravens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon they came with caw and clamor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rush of wings and cry of voices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their work of devastation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settling down upon the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delving deep with beak and talon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the body of Mondamin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with all their craft and cunning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All their skill in wiles of warfare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They perceived no danger near them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till their claws became entangled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they found themselves imprisoned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snares of Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his place of ambush came he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Striding terrible among them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so awful was his aspect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the bravest quailed with terror.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without mercy he destroyed them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right and left, by tens and twenties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their wretched, lifeless bodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung aloft on poles for scarecrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the consecrated cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a signal of his vengeance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a warning to marauders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Kahgahgee, the leader,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He alone was spared among them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a hostage for his people.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his prisoner-string he bound him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led him captive to his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied him fast with cords of elm-bark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ridge-pole of his wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kahgahgee, my raven!" said he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You the leader of the robbers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You the plotter of this mischief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contriver of this outrage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will keep you, I will hold you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a hostage for your people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pledge of good behavior!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he left him, grim and sulky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting in the morning sunshine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the summit of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Croaking fiercely his displeasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flapping his great sable pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly struggling for his freedom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly calling on his people!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer passed, and Shawondasee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed his sighs o'er all the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the South-land sent his ardor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wafted kisses warm and tender;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maize-field grew and ripened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it stood in all the splendor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its garments green and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its tassels and its plumage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maize-ears full and shining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Nokomis, the old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake, and said to Minnehaha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the Moon when leaves are falling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wild-rice has been gathered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maize is ripe and ready;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us gather in the harvest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us wrestle with Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strip him of his plumes and tassels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his garments green and yellow!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the merry Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went rejoicing from the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Nokomis, old and wrinkled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they called the women round them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called the young men and the maidens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the harvest of the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the husking of the maize-ear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the border of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the fragrant pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the old men and the warriors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking in the pleasant shadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In uninterrupted silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked they at the gamesome labor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the young men and the women;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened to their noisy talking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their laughter and their singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard them chattering like the magpies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard them laughing like the blue-jays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard them singing like the robins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whene'er some lucky maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a red ear in the husking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a maize-ear red as blood is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nushka!" cried they all together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nushka! you shall have a sweetheart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall have a handsome husband!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh!" the old men all responded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their seats beneath the pine-trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whene'er a youth or maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a crooked ear in husking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a maize-ear in the husking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blighted, mildewed, or misshapen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they laughed and sang together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept and limped about the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mimicked in their gait and gestures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some old man, bent almost double,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing singly or together:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wagemin, the thief of cornfields!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paimosaid, who steals the maize-ear!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the cornfields rang with laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till from Hiawatha's wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screamed and quivered in his anger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from all the neighboring tree-tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cawed and croaked the black marauders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh!" the old men all responded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their seats beneath the pine-trees!

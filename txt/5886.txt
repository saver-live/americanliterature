<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BALLAD OF CARMILHAN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Stralsund, by the Baltic Sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the sandy bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sunset of a summer's day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready for sea, at anchor lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good ship Valdemar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunbeams danced upon the waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And played along her side;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the cabin windows streamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ripples of golden light, that seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ripple of the tide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There sat the captain with his friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old skippers brown and hale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who smoked and grumbled o'er their grog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talked of iceberg and of fog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of calm and storm and gale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was spinning a sailor's yarn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Klaboterman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kobold of the sea; a spright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible to mortal sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who o'er the rigging ran.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes he hammered in the hold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes upon the mast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes abeam, sometimes abaft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at the bows he sang and laughed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made all tight and fast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He helped the sailors at their work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toiled with jovial din;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He helped them hoist and reef the sails,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He helped them stow the casks and bales,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heave the anchor in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But woe unto the lazy louts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idlers of the crew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them to torment was his delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And worry them by day and night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pinch them black and blue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And woe to him whose mortal eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaboterman behold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a certain sign of death!--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin-boy here held his breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt his blood run cold.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jolly skipper paused awhile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again began;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a Spectre Ship," quoth he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A ship of the Dead that sails the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is called the Carmilhan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A ghostly ship, with a ghostly crew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tempests she appears;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before the gale, or against the gale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sails without a rag of sail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a helmsman steers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She haunts the Atlantic north and south,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mostly the mid-sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where three great rocks rise bleak and bare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like furnace-chimneys in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are called the Chimneys Three.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And ill betide the luckless ship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That meets the Carmilhan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over her decks the seas will leap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must go down into the deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And perish mouse and man."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed loud with merry heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should like to see this ship," said he;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should like to find these Chimneys Three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That are marked down in the chart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have sailed right over the spot," he said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With a good stiff breeze behind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sea was blue, and the sky was clear,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can follow my course by these pinholes here,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never a rock could find."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he swore a dreadful oath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swore by the Kingdoms Three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, should he meet the Carmilhan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would run her down, although he ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right into Eternity!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, while passing to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cabin-boy had heard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lingered at the door to hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drank in all with greedy ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pondered every word.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a simple country lad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of a roving mind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, it must be like heaven," thought he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those far-off foreign lands to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fortune seek and find!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the fo'castle, when he heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mariners blaspheme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of home, he thought of God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his mother under the churchyard sod,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wished it were a dream.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One friend on board that ship had he;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the Klaboterman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who saw the Bible in his chest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a sign upon his breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All evil things to ban.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin windows have grown blank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As eyeballs of the dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more the glancing sunbeams burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gilt letters of the stern,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the figure-head;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Valdemar Victorious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who looketh with disdain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see his image in the tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismembered float from side to side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reunite again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the wind," those skippers said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That swings the vessel so;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the wind; it freshens fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is time to say farewell at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is time for us to go."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shook the captain by the hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodluck! goodluck!" they cried;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each face was like the setting sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, broad and red, they one by one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went o'er the vessel's side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun went down, the full moon rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serene o'er field and flood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the winding creeks and bays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And broad sea-meadows seemed ablaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was red as blood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southwest wind blew fresh and fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fair as wind could be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound for Odessa, o'er the bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all sail set, the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went proudly out to sea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely moon climbs up the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who walks in dreams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tower of marble in her light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wall of black, a wall of white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stately vessel seems.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low down upon the sandy coast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights begin to burn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, uplifted high in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kindle with a fiercer glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now drop far astern.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn appears, the land is gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is all around;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on each hand low hills of sand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerge and form another land;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She steereth through the Sound.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Kattegat and Skager-rack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flitteth like a ghost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By day and night, by night and day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bounds, she flies upon her way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the English coast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cape Finisterre is drawing near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cape Finisterre is past;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the open ocean stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She floats, the vision of a dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too beautiful to last.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suns rise and set, and rise, and yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no land in sight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquid planets overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burn brighter now the moon is dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And longer stays the night.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now along the horizon's edge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountains of cloud uprose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black as with forests underneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above their sharp and jagged teeth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were white as drifted snows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen behind them sank the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But flushed each snowy peak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while with rosy light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That faded slowly from the sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As blushes from the cheek.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black grew the sky,--all black, all black;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds were everywhere;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a feeling of suspense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In nature, a mysterious sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of terror in the air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all on board the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was still as still could be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save when the dismal ship-bell tolled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever and anon she rolled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lurched into the sea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain up and down the deck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went striding to and fro;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now watched the compass at the wheel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now lifted up his hand to feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which way the wind might blow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he looked up at the sails,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now upon the deep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every fibre of his frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt the storm before it came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had no thought of sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight bells! and suddenly abaft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a great rush of rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the ocean white with spume,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In darkness like the day of doom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On came the hurricane.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning flashed from cloud to cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rent the sky in two;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jagged flame, a single jet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of white fire, like a bayonet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pierced the eyeballs through.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all around was dark again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blacker than before;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in that single flash of light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had beheld a fearful sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought of the oath he swore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For right ahead lay the Ship of the Dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghostly Carmilhan!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her masts were stripped, her yards were bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her bowsprit, poised in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the Klaboterman.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her crew of ghosts was all on deck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or clambering up the shrouds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boatswain's whistle, the captain's hail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were like the piping of the gale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thunder in the clouds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close behind the Carmilhan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There rose up from the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a foundered ship of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three bare and splintered masts alone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were the Chimneys Three.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And onward dashed the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaped into the dark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A denser mist, a colder blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little shudder, and she had passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right through the Phantom Bark.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cleft in twain the shadowy hulk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cleft it unaware;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when, careering to her nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-gull severs with her breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unresisting air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the lightning flashed; again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the Carmilhan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole as before in hull and spar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now on board of the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the Klaboterman.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they all knew their doom was sealed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew that death was near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some prayed who never prayed before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some they wept, and some they swore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some were mute with fear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly there came a shock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And louder than wind or sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cry burst from the crew on deck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she dashed and crashed, a hopeless wreck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Chimneys Three.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm and night were passed, the light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To streak the east began;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin-boy, picked up at sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survived the wreck, and only he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell of the Carmilhan.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the long murmur of applause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That greeted the Musician's lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had slowly buzzed itself away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the long talk of Spectre Ships
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That followed died upon their lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And came unto a natural pause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These tales you tell are one and all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Old World," the Poet said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flowers gathered from a crumbling wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead leaves that rustle as they fall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me present you in their stead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something of our New England earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale which, though of no great worth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has still this merit, that it yields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain freshness of the fields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweetness as of home-made bread."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student answered: "Be discreet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if the flour be fresh and sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the bread be light and sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who careth in what mill 't was ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of what oven felt the heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, as old Cervantes said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are looking after better bread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any that is made of wheat?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that people nowadays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what is old give little praise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All must be new in prose and verse:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want hot bread, or something worse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh every morning, and half baked;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wholesome bread of yesterday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too stale for them, is thrown away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is their thirst with water slaked.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As oft we see the sky in May
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threaten to rain, and yet not rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet's face, before so gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was clouded with a look of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly brightened up again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And without further let or stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told his tale of yesterday.

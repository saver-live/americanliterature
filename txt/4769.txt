<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rahere, King Henrys jester, feared by all the Norman Lords
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his eye that pierced their bosoms, for his tongue that shamed their swords;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feed and flattered by the Churchmen, well they knew how deep he stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dark Henrys crooked counsels, fell upon an evil mood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, his days before him and behind him seemed to stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped and barren, fixed and fruitless, as those leagues of naked sand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When St. Michaels ebb slinks outward to the bleak horizon-bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trampling wide-mouthed waters are withdrawn from sight and sound.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a Horror of Great Darkness sunk his spirit and, anon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who had seen him wince and whiten as he turned to walk alone)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed Gilbert the Physician, and muttered in his ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast it, O my brother? Yea, I have it, said Rahere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it comes, said Gilbert smoothly, mans most immanent distress.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis a humour of the Spirit which abhorreth all excess;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, whatever breed the surfeit, Wealth, or Wit, or Power, or Fame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And thou hast each) the Spirit laboureth to expel the same.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the dulled eyes deep self-loathing hence the loaded leaden brow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the burden of Wanhope that aches thy soul and body now.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, the merriest fool must face it, and the wisest Doctor learn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it comes, it comes, said Gilbert, as it passes, to return.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rahere was in his torment, and he wandered, dumb and far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he came to reeking Smithfield where the crowded gallows are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Followed Gilbert the Physician) and beneath the wry-necked dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat a leper and his woman, very merry, breaking bread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was cloaked from chin to ankle, faceless, fingerless, obscene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere corruption swaddled man-wise, but the woman whole and clean;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she waited on him crooning, and Rahere beheld the twain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each delighting in the other, and he checked and groaned again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it comes,, it comes, said Gilbert, as it came when Life began.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis a motion of the Spirit that revealeth God to man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shape of Love exceeding, which regards not taint or fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since in perfect Love, saith Scripture, can be no excess at all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the eye that sees no blemish, hence the hour that holds no shame.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the Soul assured the Essence and the Substance are the same.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, the meanest need not miss it, though the mightier pass it by;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it comes, it comes, said Gilbert, and, thou seest, it does not die!

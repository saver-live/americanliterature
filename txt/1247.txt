&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mind me in the days departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often underneath the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With childish bounds I used to run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a garden long deserted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beds and walks were vanished quite;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wheresoe'er had struck the spade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greenest grasses Nature laid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sanctify her right.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I called the place my wilderness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For no one entered there but I;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheep looked in, the grass to espy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed it ne'ertheless.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees were interwoven wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spread their boughs enough about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep both sheep and shepherd out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not a happy child.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adventurous joy it was for me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I crept beneath the boughs, and found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A circle smooth of mossy ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a poplar tree.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old garden rose-trees hedged it in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedropt with roses waxen-white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well satisfied with dew and light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And careless to be seen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long years ago it might befall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the garden flowers were trim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave old gardener prided him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these the most of all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some lady, stately overmuch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here moving with a silken noise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has blushed beside them at the voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That likened her to such.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these, to make a diadem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She often may have plucked and twined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-smiling as it came to mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That few would look at them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, little thought that lady proud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child would watch her fair white rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When buried lay her whiter brows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silk was changed for shroud!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor thought that gardener, (full of scorns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For men unlearned and simple phrase,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child would bring it all its praise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By creeping through the thorns!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me upon my low moss seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though never a dream the roses sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of science or love's compliment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ween they smelt as sweet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did not move my grief to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trace of human step departed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the garden was deserted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blither place for me!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends, blame me not! a narrow ken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has childhood 'twixt the sun and sward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We draw the moral afterward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel the gladness then.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gladdest hours for me did glide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence at the rose-tree wall:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thrush made gladness musical
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the other side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor he nor I did e'er incline
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To peck or pluck the blossoms white;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should I know but roses might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead lives as glad as mine?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make my hermit-home complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought dear water from the spring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praised in its own low murmuring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cresses glossy wet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, I thought, my likeness grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Without the melancholy tale)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To "Gentle Hermit of the Dale,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Angelina too.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For oft I read within my nook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such minstrel stories; till the breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made sounds poetic in the trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I shut the book.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I shut this wherein I write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear no more the wind athwart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those trees, nor feel that childish heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delighting in delight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My childhood from my life is parted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My footstep from the moss which drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its fairy circle round: anew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden is deserted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thrush may there rehearse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madrigals which sweetest are;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more for me! myself afar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do sing a sadder verse.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me, ah me! when erst I lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that child's-nest so greenly wrought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laughed unto myself and thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time will pass away."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still I laughed, and did not fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that, whene'er was past away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The childish time, some happier play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My womanhood would cheer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew the time would pass away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, beside the rose-tree wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear God, how seldom, if at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I look up to pray!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is past; and now that grows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cypress high among the trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I behold white sepulchres
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as the white rose,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When graver, meeker thoughts are given,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have learnt to lift my face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminded how earth's greenest place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color draws from heaven,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It something saith for earthly pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more for Heavenly promise free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I who was, would shrink to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That happy child again.

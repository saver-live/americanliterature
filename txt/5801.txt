<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine sisters, beautiful in form and face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from their convent on the shining heights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Pierus, the mountain of delights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dwell among the people at its base.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then seemed the world to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All time and space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splendor of cloudless days and starry nights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men and manners, and all sounds and sights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a new meaning, a diviner grace.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud were these sisters, but were not too proud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To teach in schools of little country towns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science and song, and all the arts that please;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that while housewives span, and farmers ploughed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their comely daughters, clad in homespun gowns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned the sweet songs of the Pierides.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street sounds to the soldiers' tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out we troop to see:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single redcoat turns his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turns and looks at me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My man, from sky to sky's so far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never crossed before;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leagues apart the world's ends are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're like to meet no more;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What thoughts at heart have you and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot stop to tell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dead or living, drunk or dry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldier, I wish you well.
</pre>

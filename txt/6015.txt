<p>Eternal brood the shadows on this ground,<br> Dreaming of centuries that have gone before;<br> Great elms rise solemnly by slab and mound,<br> Arched high above a hidden world of yore.<br> Round all the scene a light of memory plays,<br> And dead leaves whisper of departed days,<br> Longing for sights and sounds that are no more.</p>
<p>Lonely and sad, a specter glides along<br> Aisles where of old his living footsteps fell;<br> No common glance discerns him, though his song<br> Peals down through time with a mysterious spell.<br> Only the few who sorcery's secret know,<br> Espy amidst these tombs the shade of Poe.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we settled it all when the storm was done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As comfy as comfy could be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was to wait in the barn, my dears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I was only three;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Teddy would run to the rainbows foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was five and a man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thats how it all began, my dears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thats how it all began!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we brought the lances down, then the trumpets blew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we went to Kandahar, ridin two an two.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridin, ridin, ridin, two an two!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-a!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way to Kandahar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridin two an two.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The, wolf-cub at even lay hid in the corn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the smoke of the cooking hung grey.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew where the doe made a couch for her fawn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he looked to his strength for his prey.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the moon swept the smoke-wreaths away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he turned from his meal in the villagers close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he bayed to the moon as she rose.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a thousand men, said he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wait upon my will;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And towers nine upon the Tyne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three upon the Till.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what care I for your men? said she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or towers from Tyne to Till?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sith you must go with me, said she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wait upon my will.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you may lead a thousand men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ever draw the rein,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before you lead the Fairy Queen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twill burst your heart in twain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has slipped his foot from the stirrup-bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridle from his hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is bound by hand and foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Queen of Fairy Land.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have taken the common clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrought it cunningly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shape of a God that was digged a clod,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater honour to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou hast taken the common clay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy hands be not free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the taint of the soil, thou hast made thy spoil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater shame to thee.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lark will make her hymn to God,:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partridge call her brood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I forget the heath I trod,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields wherein I stood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis dule to know not night from morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But greater dule to know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can but hear the hunters horn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That once I used to blow.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three friends that buried the fourth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mould in his mouth and the dust in his eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they-went south and east and north,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong man fights but the sick man dies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three friends that spoke of the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong man fights but the sick man dies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would he were here with us now, they said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun in our face and the wind in our eyes.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet at the last, ere our spearmen had found him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet at the last, ere a sword-thrust could save,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet at the last, with his masters around him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke of the Faith as a master to slave.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet at the last, though the Kafirs had maimed him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken by bondage and wrecked by the reiver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet at the last, tho the darkness had claimed him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called upon Allah, and died a Believer!

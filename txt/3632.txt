<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Hoed and trenched and weeded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took the flowers to fair:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought them home unheeded;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hue was not the wear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So up and down I sow them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For lads like me to find,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I shall lie below them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dead man out of mind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some seed the birds devour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some the season mars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here and there will flower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solitary stars,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fields will yearly bear them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As light-leaved spring comes on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And luckless lads will wear them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am dead and gone.

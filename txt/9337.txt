<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fascination of whats difficult
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spontaneous joy and natural content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of my heart. Theres something ails our colt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That must, as if it had not holy blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor on an Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though it dragged road metal. My curse on plays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have to be set up in fifty ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the days war with every knave and dolt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theatre business, management of men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear before the dawn comes round again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill find the stable and pull out the bolt.

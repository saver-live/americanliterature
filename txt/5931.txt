<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it be the sun descending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the level plain of water?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the Red Swan floating, flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounded by the magic arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staining all the waves with crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the crimson of its life-blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the air with splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the splendor of its plumage?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes; it is the sun descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking down into the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sky is stained with purple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the water flushed with crimson!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No; it is the Red Swan floating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diving down beneath the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sky its wings are lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its blood the waves are reddened!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over it the Star of Evening
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melts and trembles through the purple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hangs suspended in the twilight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No; it is a bead of wampum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the robes of the Great Spirit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he passes through the twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walks in silence through the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This with joy beheld Iagoo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said in haste: "Behold it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the sacred Star of Evening!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear a tale of wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the story of Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of the Evening Star, Osseo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once, in days no more remembered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ages nearer the beginning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heavens were closer to us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Gods were more familiar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the North-land lived a hunter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ten young and comely daughters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall and lithe as wands of willow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Oweenee, the youngest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She the wilful and the wayward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She the silent, dreamy maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the fairest of the sisters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All these women married warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Married brave and haughty husbands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Oweenee, the youngest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed and flouted all her lovers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her young and handsome suitors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then married old Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Osseo, poor and ugly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken with age and weak with coughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always coughing like a squirrel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, but beautiful within him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the spirit of Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Evening Star descended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star of Evening, Star of Woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star of tenderness and passion!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its fire was in his bosom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its beauty in his spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its mystery in his being,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its splendor in his language!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And her lovers, the rejected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsome men with belts of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsome men with paint and feathers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointed at her in derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed her with jest and laughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she said: 'I care not for you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care not for your belts of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care not for your paint and feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care not for your jests and laughter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy with Osseo!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once to some great feast invited,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the damp and dusk of evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked together the ten sisters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked together with their husbands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly followed old Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fair Oweenee beside him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the others chatted gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two only walked in silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the western sky Osseo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed intent, as if imploring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often stopped and gazed imploring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the trembling Star of Evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the tender Star of Woman;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they heard him murmur softly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ah, showain nemeshin, Nosa!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pity, pity me, my father!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Listen!' said the eldest sister,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He is praying to his father!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a pity that the old man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not stumble in the pathway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not break his neck by falling!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they laughed till all the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang with their unseemly laughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On their pathway through the woodlands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay an oak, by storms uprooted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the great trunk of an oak-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried half in leaves and mosses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouldering, crumbling, huge and hollow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Osseo, when he saw it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave a shout, a cry of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped into its yawning cavern,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one end went in an old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other came a young man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall and straight and strong and handsome.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus Osseo was transfigured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus restored to youth and beauty;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, alas for good Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Oweenee, the faithful!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangely, too, was she transfigured.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed into a weak old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a staff she tottered onward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sisters and their husbands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed until the echoing forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang with their unseemly laughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Osseo turned not from her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked with slower step beside her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took her hand, as brown and withered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an oak-leaf is in Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called her sweetheart, Nenemoosha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothed her with soft words of kindness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they reached the lodge of feasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they sat down in the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred to the Star of Evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the tender Star of Woman.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wrapt in visions, lost in dreaming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the banquet sat Osseo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were merry, all were happy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were joyous but Osseo.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither food nor drink he tasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither did he speak nor listen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as one bewildered sat he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking dreamily and sadly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First at Oweenee, then upward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gleaming sky above them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then a voice was heard, a whisper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the starry distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the empty vastness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low, and musical, and tender;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the voice said: 'O Osseo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my son, my best beloved!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken are the spells that bound you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the charms of the magicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic powers of evil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to me; ascend, Osseo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Taste the food that stands before you:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is blessed and enchanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has magic virtues in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will change you to a spirit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your bowls and all your kettles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be wood and clay no longer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bowls be changed to wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the kettles shall be silver;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shall shine like shells of scarlet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the fire shall gleam and glimmer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'And the women shall no longer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear the dreary doom of labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But be changed to birds, and glisten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beauty of the starlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted with the dusky splendors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the skies and clouds of evening!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What Osseo heard as whispers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What as words he comprehended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was but music to the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music as of birds afar off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the whippoorwill afar off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lonely Wawonaissa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing in the darksome forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then the lodge began to tremble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight began to shake and tremble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they felt it rising, rising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly through the air ascending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the darkness of the tree-tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into the dewy starlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it passed the topmost branches;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold! the wooden dishes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were changed to shells of scarlet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold! the earthen kettles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were changed to bowls of silver!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roof-poles of the wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were as glittering rods of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roof of bark upon them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the shining shards of beetles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then Osseo gazed around him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he saw the nine fair sisters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sisters and their husbands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to birds of various plumage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some were jays and some were magpies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others thrushes, others blackbirds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they hopped, and sang, and twittered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perked and fluttered all their feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strutted in their shining plumage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their tails like fans unfolded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only Oweenee, the youngest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not changed, but sat in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking sadly at the others;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Osseo, gazing upward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave another cry of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a cry as he had uttered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the oak-tree in the forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then returned her youth and beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her soiled and tattered garments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were transformed to robes of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her staff became a feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a shining silver feather!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And again the wigwam trembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swayed and rushed through airy currents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through transparent cloud and vapor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amid celestial splendors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Evening Star alighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a snow-flake falls on snow-flake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a leaf drops on a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the thistledown on water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forth with cheerful words of welcome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the father of Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He with radiant locks of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He with eyes serene and tender.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said: 'My son, Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang the cage of birds you bring there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang the cage with rods of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the birds with glistening feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of my wigwam.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the door he hung the bird-cage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they entered in and gladly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened to Osseo's father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruler of the Star of Evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said: 'O my Osseo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had compassion on you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given you back your youth and beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into birds of various plumage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed your sisters and their husbands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed them thus because they mocked you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the figure of the old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that aspect sad and wrinkled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not see your heart of passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not see your youth immortal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Oweenee, the faithful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw your naked heart and loved you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'In the lodge that glimmers yonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the little star that twinkles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the vapors, on the left hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives the envious Evil Spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wabeno, the magician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who transformed you to an old man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take heed lest his beams fall on you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rays he darts around him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the power of his enchantment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the arrows that he uses.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many years, in peace and quiet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the peaceful Star of Evening
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelt Osseo with his father;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years, in song and flutter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung the cage with rods of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fair Oweenee, the faithful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore a son unto Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beauty of his mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the courage of his father.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the boy grew up and prospered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Osseo, to delight him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made him little bows and arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened the great cage of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let loose his aunts and uncles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those birds with glossy feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his little son to shoot at.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Round and round they wheeled and darted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the Evening Star with music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their songs of joy and freedom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the Evening Star with splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fluttering of their plumage;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the boy, the little hunter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent his bow and shot an arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot a swift and fatal arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a bird, with shining feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet fell wounded sorely.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, O wondrous transformation!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was no bird he saw before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was a beautiful young woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrow in her bosom!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When her blood fell on the planet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sacred Star of Evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken was the spell of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerless was the strange enchantment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the youth, the fearless bowman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly felt himself descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held by unseen hands, but sinking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward through the empty spaces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward through the clouds and vapors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he rested on an island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an island, green and grassy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder in the Big-Sea-Water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After him he saw descending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the birds with shining feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluttering, falling, wafted downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the painted leaves of Autumn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lodge with poles of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its roof like wings of beetles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the shining shards of beetles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the winds of heaven uplifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly sank upon the island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing back the good Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing Oweenee, the faithful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then the birds, again transfigured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassumed the shape of mortals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took their shape, but not their stature;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They remained as Little People,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the pygmies, the Puk-Wudjies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on pleasant nights of Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Evening Star was shining,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand in hand they danced together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the island's craggy headlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sand-beach low and level.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still their glittering lodge is seen there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tranquil Summer evenings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon the shore the fisher
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes hears their happy voices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees them dancing in the starlight!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the story was completed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wondrous tale was ended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking round upon his listeners,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemnly Iagoo added:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are great men, I have known such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom their people understand not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom they even make a jest of,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scoff and jeer at in derision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the story of Osseo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us learn the fate of jesters!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wedding guests delighted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened to the marvellous story,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened laughing and applauding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they whispered to each other:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does he mean himself, I wonder?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are we the aunts and uncles?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again sang Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang a song of love and longing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those accents sweet and tender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those tones of pensive sadness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang a maiden's lamentation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her lover, her Algonquin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I think of my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! think of my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my heart is thinking of him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah me! when I parted from him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round my neck he hung the wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pledge, the snow-white wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go with you, he whispered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! to your native country;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go with you, he whispered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Far away, away, I answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very far away, I answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! is my native country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I looked back to behold him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we parted, to behold him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After me he still was gazing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By the tree he still was standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the fallen tree was standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had dropped into the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I think of my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! think of my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my heart is thinking of him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was Hiawatha's Wedding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the dance of Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the story of Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the songs of Chibiabos;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the wedding banquet ended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wedding guests departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving Hiawatha happy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the night and Minnehaha.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wenlock Edge the wood's in trouble;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His forest fleece the Wrekin heaves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gale, it plies the saplings double,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thick on Severn snow the leaves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould blow like this through holt and hanger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Uricon the city stood:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis the old wind in the old anger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then it threshed another wood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, 'twas before my time, the Roman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At yonder heaving hill would stare:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood that warms an English yeoman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts that hurt him, they were there.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, like the wind through woods in riot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through him the gale of life blew high;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree of man was never quiet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then 'twas the Roman, now 'tis I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gale, it plies the saplings double,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It blows so hard, 'twill soon be gone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day the Roman and his trouble
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are ashes under Uricon.

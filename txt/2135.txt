<p>WHOEVER comes to shroud me, do not harm,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Nor question much,<br> That subtle wreath of hair, which crowns my arm;<br> The mystery, the sign, you must not touch;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>For 'tis my outward soul,<br> Viceroy to that, which then to heaven being gone,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Will leave this to control<br> And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.<br> <br> For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Through every part<br> Can tie those parts, and make me one of all,<br> Those hairs which upward grew, and strength and art<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Have from a better brain,<br> Can better do 't; except she meant that I<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>By this should know my pain,<br> As prisoners then are manacled, when they're condemn'd to die.<br> <br> Whate'er she meant by it, bury it with me,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>For since I am<br> Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry,<br> If into other hands these relics came.<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>As 'twas humility<br> To afford to it all that a soul can do,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>So 'tis some bravery,<br> That since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.</p>

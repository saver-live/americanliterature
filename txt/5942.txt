<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Ben Levi, on the Sabbath, read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A volume of the Law, in which it said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No man shall look upon my face and live."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he read, he prayed that God would give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His faithful servant grace with mortal eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look upon His face and yet not die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fell a sudden shadow on the page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lifting up his eyes, grown dim with age
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the Angel of Death before him stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding a naked sword in his right hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Ben Levi was a righteous man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet through his veins a chill of terror ran.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With trembling voice he said, "What wilt thou here?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel answered, "Lo! the time draws near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou must die; yet first, by God's decree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er thou askest shall be granted thee."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replied the Rabbi, "Let these living eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First look upon my place in Paradise."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the Angel, "Come with me and look."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Ben Levi closed the sacred book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rising, and uplifting his gray head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me thy sword," he to the Angel said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lest thou shouldst fall upon me by the way."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel smiled and hastened to obey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then led him forth to the Celestial Town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set him on the wall, whence, gazing down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Ben Levi, with his living eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might look upon his place in Paradise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then straight into the city of the Lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rabbi leaped with the Death-Angel's sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the streets there swept a sudden breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of something there unknown, which men call death.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Angel stayed without and cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come back!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which the Rabbi's voice replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! in the name of God, whom I adore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear that hence I will depart no more!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all the Angels cried, "O Holy One,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See what the son of Levi here hath done!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom of Heaven he takes by violence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Thy name refuses to go hence!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord replied, "My Angels, be not wroth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did e'er the son of Levi break his oath?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him remain; for he with mortal eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall look upon my face and yet not die."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the outer wall the Angel of Death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the great voice, and said, with panting breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give back the sword, and let me go my way."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat the Rabbi paused, and answered, "Nay!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anguish enough already hath it caused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the sons of men."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while he paused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the awful mandate of the Lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resounding through the air, "Give back the sword!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rabbi bowed his head in silent prayer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said he to the dreadful Angel, "Swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No human eye shall look on it again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when thou takest away the souls of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thyself unseen, and with an unseen sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt perform the bidding of the Lord."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel took the sword again, and swore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And walks on earth unseen forevermore.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ended: and a kind of spell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the silent listeners fell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His solemn manner and his words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had touched the deep, mysterious chords,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That vibrate in each human breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike, but not alike confessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual world seemed near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close above them, full of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its awful adumbration passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A luminous shadow, vague and vast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They almost feared to look, lest there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embodied from the impalpable air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might behold the Angel stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the sword in his right hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, but in a voice subdued,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to disturb their dreamy mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the Sicilian: "While you spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling your legend marvellous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly in my memory woke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of one, now gone from us,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old Abate, meek and mild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and teacher, when a child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sometimes in those days of old
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of an Angel told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ran, as I remember, thus?'

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They met still sooner. 'Twas a year from thence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Lucy Gresham, the sick sempstress girl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sewed by Marian's chair so still and quick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leant her head upon its back to cough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More freely, when, the mistress turning round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others took occasion to laugh out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave up at last. Among the workers, spoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bold girl with black eyebrows and red lips:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know the news? Who's dying, do you think?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Lucy Gresham. I expected it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As little as Nell Hart's wedding. Blush not, Nell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy curls be red enough without thy cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, some day, there'll be found a man to dote
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On red curls. Lucy Gresham swooned last night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropped sudden in the street while going home;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the baker says, who took her up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid her by her grandmother in bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll give her a week to die in. Pass the silk.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's hope he gave her a loaf too, within reach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For otherwise they'll starve before they die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That funny pair of bedfellows! Miss Bell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll thank you for the scissors. The old crone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is paralytic that's the reason why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Lucy's thread went faster than her breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which went too quick, we all know. Marian Erle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Marian Erle, you're not the fool to cry?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your tears spoil Lady Waldemar's new dress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You piece of pity!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marian rose up straight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, breaking through the talk and through the work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went outward, in the face of their surprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Lucy's home, to nurse her back to life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or down to death. She knew, by such an act,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All place and grace were forfeit in the house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose mistress would supply the missing hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With necessary, not inhuman haste,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take no blame. But pity, too, had dues:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not leave a solitary soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To founder in the dark, while she sat still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lavished stitches on a lady's hem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if no other work were paramount.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, God," thought Marian, "has a missing hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment; Lucy wants a drink, perhaps.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let others miss me! never miss me, God!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Marian sat by Lucy's bed, content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With duty, and was strong, for recompense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold the lamp of human love arm-high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch the death-strained eyes and comfort them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the angels, on the luminous side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of death, had got theirs ready. And she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucy thanked her sometimes, called her kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It touched her strangely. "Marian Erle called kind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, Marian, beaten and sold, who could not die!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis verily good fortune to be kind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah you," she said, "who are born to such a grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sorry for the unlicensed class, the poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced to think the best good fortune means
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That others, simply, should be kind to them."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From sleep to sleep when Lucy had slid away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So gently, like the light upon a hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which none names the moment that it goes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all see when 'tis gone, a man came in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood beside the bed. The old idiot wretch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screamed feebly, like a baby overlain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, sir, you won't mistake me for the corpse?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't look at me, sir! never bury me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I lie here, I'm alive as you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except my legs and arms, I eat and drink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And understand, (that you're the gentleman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fits the funerals up, Heaven speed you, sir),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certainly I should be livelier still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucy here . . . sir, Lucy is the corpse . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had worked more properly to buy me wine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lucy, sir, was always slow at work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shan't lose much by Lucy. Marian Erle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak up and show the gentleman the corpse."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a voice said "Marian Erle." She rose;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the hour for angels there, stood hers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She scarcely marvelled to see Romney Leigh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As light November snows to empty nests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As grass to graves, as moss to mildewed stones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As July suns to ruins, through the rents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ministering spirits to mourners, through a loss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Heaven itself to men, through pangs of death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came uncalled wherever grief had come.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And so," said Marian Erle, "we met anew,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And added softly, "so, we shall not part."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not angry that she had left the house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein he placed her. Well she had feared it might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have vexed him. Also, when he found her set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On keeping, though the dead was out of sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That half-dead, half-alive body left behind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With cankerous heart and flesh, which took your best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cursed you for the little good it did
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Could any leave the bed-rid wretch alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So joyless she was thankless even to God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much more to you?), he did not say 'twas well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Marian thought he did not take it ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since day by day he came, and every day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt within his utterance and his eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closer, tenderer presence of the soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last he said "We shall not part."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that same day was Marian's work complete:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had smoothed the empty bed, and swept the floor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of coffin sawdust, set the chairs anew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead had ended gossip in, and stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that poor room so cold and orderly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door-key in her hand, prepared to go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they had, howbeit not their way. He spoke.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Marian, of one clay God made us all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though men push and poke and paddle in't
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As children play at fashioning dirt-pies)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And call their fancies by the name of facts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming difference, lordship, privilege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all's plain dirt, they come back to it at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first grave-digger proves it with a spade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pats all even. Need we wait for this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Marian, and I, Romney?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, at that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked blindly in his face, as when one looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through driving autumn-rains to find the sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on speaking.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marian, I being born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What men call noble, and you, issued from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble people, though the tyrannous sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which pierced Christ's heart, has cleft the world in twain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt class and class, opposing rich to poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we keep parted? Not so. Let us lean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strain together rather, each to each,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compress the red lips of this gaping wound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as two souls can, ay, lean and league,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I from my superabundance, from your want
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, joining in a protest 'gainst the wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the rest, he held her hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking, which confused the sense of much.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her heart against his words beat out so thick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might as well be written on the dust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where some poor bird, escaping from hawk's beak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has dropped and beats its shuddering wings, the lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are rubbed so, yet 'twas something like to this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That they two, standing at the two extremes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of social classes, had received one seal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Been dedicate and drawn beyond themselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mercy and ministration, he, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through what he knew, and she, through what she felt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, by man's conscience, she, by woman's heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relinquishing their several 'vantage posts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wealthy ease and honourable toil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To work with God at love. And since God willed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That putting out his hand to touch this ark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a woman's hand there, he'd accept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sign too, hold the tender fingers fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And say 'My fellow-worker, be my wife!'"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told the tale with simple, rustic turns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong leaps of meaning in her sudden eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That took the gaps of any imperfect phrase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the unschooled speaker: I have rather writ
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing I understood so, than the thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard so. And I cannot render right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her quick gesticulation, wild yet soft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-startled from the habitual mood she used,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half sad, half languid, like dumb creatures (now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rustling bird, and now a wandering deer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or squirrel 'gainst the oak-gloom flashing up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sidelong burnished head, in just her way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of savage spontaneity), that stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abruptly the green silence of the woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make it stranger, holier, more profound;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Nature's general heart confessed itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life, and then fell backward on repose.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kissed the lips that ended. "So indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves you, Marian?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Loves me!" She looked up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a child's wonder when you ask him first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who made the sun a puzzled blush, that grew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then broke off in a rapid radiant smile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sure solution. "Loves me! he loves all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And me, of course. He had not asked me else
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To work with him for ever and be his wife."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her words reproved me. This perhaps was love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have its hands too full of gifts to give,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For putting out a hand to take a gift;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To love so much, the perfect round of love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes, in strict conclusion, being loved;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Eden-dew went up and fell again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough for watering Eden. Obviously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had not thought about his love at all:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cataracts of her soul had poured themselves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And risen self-crowned in rainbow: would she ask
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who crowned her? it sufficed that she was crowned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With women of my class 'tis otherwise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We haggle for the small change of our gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so much love accord for so much love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rialto-prices. Are we therefore wrong?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If marriage be a contract, look to it then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracting parties should be equal, just;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if, a simple fealty on one side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mere religion, right to give, is all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certain brides of Europe duly ask
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mount the pile as Indian widows do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spices of their tender youth heaped up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jewels of their gracious virtues worn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More gems, more glory, to consume entire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a living husband: as the man's alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not dead, the woman's duty by so much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced in England beyond Hindostan.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat there musing, till she touched my hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hers, as softly as a strange white bird
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feared to startle in touching. "You are kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But are you, peradventure, vexed at heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because your cousin takes me for a wife?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I am not worthy nay, in truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad on't, since, for that, he chooses me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes the poor things of the world the best;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not therefore, if I could, be rich.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It pleasures him to stoop for buttercups;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not be a rose upon the wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A queen might stop at, near the palace-door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say to a courtier 'Pluck that rose for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It's prettier than the rest.' O Romney Leigh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd rather far be trodden by his foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than lie in a great queen's bosom."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet Marian, do you disavow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roses with that face?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dropped her head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the wind had caught that flower of her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bent it in the garden, then looked up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With grave assurance. "Well, you think me bold!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so we all are, when we're praying God.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I'm bold yet, lady, credit me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, since I know myself for what I am,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much fitter for his handmaid than his wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll prove the handmaid and the wife at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve tenderly, and love obediently,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be a worthier mate, perhaps, than some
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are wooed in silk among their learned books;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I shall set myself to read his eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till such grow plainer to me than the French
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wisest ladies. Do you think I'll miss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter, in the spelling of his mind?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than they do when they sit and write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their flying words with flickering wild-fowl tails,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ever pause to ask how many t's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should that be y or i, they know't so well:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen them writing, when I brought a dress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waited, floating out their soft white hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On shining paper. But they're hard, sometimes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all those hands! we've used out many nights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And worn the yellow daylight into shreds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which flapped and shivered down our aching eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till night appeared more tolerable, just
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pretty ladies might look beautiful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who said at last . . . 'You're lazy in that house!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You're slow in sending home the work, I count
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I've waited near an hour for't.' Pardon me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not blame them, madam, nor misprize;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are fair and gracious; ay, but not like you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since none but you has Mister Leigh's own blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both noble and gentle, and, without it . . . well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are fair, I said; so fair, it scarce seems strange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, flashing out in any looking-glass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonder of their glorious brows and breasts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're charmed so, they forget to look behind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mark how pale we've grown, we pitiful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remainders of the world. And so perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mister Leigh had chosen a wife from these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She might, although he's better than her best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dearly she would know it, steal a thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which should be all his, an eye-glance from his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To plunge into the mirror opposite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In search of her own beauty's pearl; while I . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, dearest lady, serge will outweigh silk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For winter-wear when bodies feel a-cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll be a true wife to your cousin Leigh."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I answered he was there himself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he had been standing in the room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listened probably to half her talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrested, turned to stone, as white as stone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will tender sayings make men look so white?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves her then profoundly.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora? Here I meet you!" We clasped hands.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even so, dear Romney. Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has sent me in haste to find a cousin of mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall be."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lady Waldemar is good."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here's one, at least, who is good," I sighed, and touched
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Marian's happy head, as doglike she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most passionately patient, waited on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-tremble for her turn of greeting words;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've sat a full hour with your Marian Erle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learnt the thing by heart, and from my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am therefore competent to give you thanks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a cousin."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You accept at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gift from me, Aurora, without scorn?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last I please you?" How his voice was changed.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You cannot please a woman against her will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once you vexed me. Shall we speak of that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll say, then, you were noble in it all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I not ignorant let it pass! And now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You please me, Romney, when you please yourself;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, please you, be fanatical in love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm well pleased. Ah, cousin! at the old hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the gallery portraits of our Leighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not find a sweeter signory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than this pure forehead's."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a word he said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How arrogant men are! Even philanthropists,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who try to take a wife up in the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put down a subscription-cheque, if once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turns and says "I will not tax you so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most charitable sir," feel ill at ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though she had wronged them somehow. I suppose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We women should remember what we are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not throw back an obolus inscribed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Cæsar's image, lightly. I resumed.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It strikes me, some of those sublime Vandykes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were not too proud to make good saints in heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if so, then they're not too proud to-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bow down (now the ruffs are off their necks)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And own this good, true, noble Marian, yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mine, I'll say! For poets (bear the word),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-poets even, are still whole democrats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, not that we're disloyal to the high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But loyal to the low, and cognisant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the less scrutable majesties. For me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I comprehend your choice, I justify
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your right in choosing."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, no," he sighed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sort of melancholy, impatient scorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some grown man who never had a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puts by some child who plays at being a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You did not, do not, cannot comprehend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My choice, my ends, my motives, nor myself:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter now; we'll let it pass, you say.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you for your generous cousinship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which helps this present; I accept for her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your favourable thoughts. We're fallen on days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We two who are not poets, when to wed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requires less mutual love than common love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two together to bear out at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the loveless many. Work in pairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In galley-couplings or in marriage-rings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference lies in the honour, not the work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such we're bound to, I and she. But love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You poets are benighted in this age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour's too late for catching even moths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've gnats instead), love! love's fool-paradise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is out of date, like Adam's. Set a swan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To swim the Trenton, rather than true love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To float its fabulous plumage safely down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cataracts of this loud transition-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose roar for ever henceforth in my ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must keep me deaf to music."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, I turned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissed poor Marian, out of discontent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man had baffled, chafed me, till I flung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For refuge to the woman, as, sometimes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impatient of some crowded room's close smell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You throw a window open and lean out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To breathe a long breath in the dewy night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cool your angry forehead. She, at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not built up as walls are, brick by brick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each fancy squared, each feeling ranged by line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very heat of burning youth applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To indurate form and system! excellent bricks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-built wall, which stops you on the road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into which you cannot see an inch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you beat your head against it pshaw!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adieu," I said, "for this time, cousins both,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, cousin Romney, pardon me the word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be happy! oh, in some esoteric sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course! I mean no harm in wishing well.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu, my Marian: may she come to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Romney, and be married from my house?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not part of your philosophy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep your bird upon the blackthorn?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, "but it is. I take my wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly from the people, and she comes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Austria's daughter to imperial France,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt her eagles, blinking not her race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Margaret's Court at garret-height, to meet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wed me at Saint James's, nor put off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gown of serge for that. The things we do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do: we'll wear no mask, as if we blushed."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Romney, you're the poet," I replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But felt my smile too mournful for my word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned and went. Ay, masks, I thought, beware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tragic masks we tie before the glass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplifted on the cothurn half a yard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the natural stature! we would play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic parts to ourselves, and end, perhaps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As impotently as Athenian wives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shrieked in fits at the Eumenides.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His foot pursued me down the stair. "At least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll suffer me to walk with you beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These hideous streets, these graves, where men alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packed close with earthworms, burr unconsciously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the plague that slew them; let me go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very women pelt their souls in mud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any woman who walks here alone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How came you here alone? you are ignorant."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a strange and melancholy walk:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night came drizzling downward in dark rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as we walked, the colour of the time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act, the presence, my hand upon his arm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice in my ear, and mine to my own sense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeared unnatural. We talked modern books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And daily papers, Spanish marriage-schemes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And English climate was't so cold last year?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will the wind change by to-morrow morn?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Guizot stand? is London full? is trade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitive? has Dickens turned his hinge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-pinch upon the fingers of the great?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are potatoes to grow mythical
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like moly? will the apple die out too?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which way is the wind to-night? south-east? due east?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked on fast, while every common word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed tangled with the thunder at one end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ready to pull down upon our heads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terror out of sight. And yet to pause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were surelier mortal: we tore greedily up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All silence, all the innocent breathing-points,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if, like pale conspirators in haste,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tore up papers where our signatures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperilled us to an ugly shame or death.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot tell you why it was. 'Tis plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had not loved nor hated: wherefore dread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spill gunpowder on ground safe from fire?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we had lived too closely, to diverge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So absolutely: leave two clocks, they say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wound up to different hours, upon one shelf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slowly, through the interior wheels of each,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blind mechanic motion sets itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-throb to feel out for the mutual time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not so with us, indeed: while he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck midnight, I kept striking six at dawn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he marked judgment, I, redemption-day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such exception to a general law
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperious upon inert matter even,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might make us, each to either, insecure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beckoning mystery or a troubling fear.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mind me, when we parted at the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strange his good-night sounded, like good-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside a deathbed, where the morrow's sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sure to come too late for more good-days:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that night I thought . . . "Goodnight," said he.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, a month passed. Let me set it down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At once, I have been wrong, I have been wrong.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are wrong always when we think too much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what we think or are: albeit our thoughts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be verily bitter as self-sacrifice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're no less selfish. If we sleep on rocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or roses, sleeping past the hour of noon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're lazy. This I write against myself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had done a duty in the visit paid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Marian, and was ready otherwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give the witness of my presence and name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever she should marry. Which, I thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficed. I even had cast into the scale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An overweight of justice toward the match;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lady Waldemar had missed her tool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had broken it in the lock as being too straight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a crooked purpose, while poor Marian Erle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missed nothing in my accents or my acts:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not been ungenerous on the whole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet untender; so, enough. I felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired, overworked: this marriage somewhat jarred;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if it did not, all the bridal noise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pricking of the map of life with pins,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In schemes of . . . "Here we'll go," and "There we'll stay,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Everywhere we'll prosper in our love,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was scarce my business: let them order it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who else should care? I threw myself aside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who had done her work and shuts her eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rest the better.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, who should have known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forereckoned mischief! Where we disavow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being keeper to our brother, we're his Cain.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might have held that poor child to my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little longer! 'twould have hurt me much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have hastened by its beats the marriage day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kept her safe meantime from tampering hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, peradventure, traps. What drew me back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From telling Romney plainly the designs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Lady Waldemar, as spoken out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me . . . me? Had I any right, ay, right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With womanly compassion and reserve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To break the fall of woman's impudence?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stand by calmly, knowing what I knew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear him call her good?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distrust that word.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is none good save God," said Jesus Christ.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If He once, in the first creation-week,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called creatures good, for ever, afterward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Devil only has done it, and his heirs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knaves who win so, and the fools who lose;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word's grown dangerous. In the middle age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they called malignant fays and imps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good people. A good neighbour, even in this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is fatal sometimes, cuts your morning up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mincemeat of the very smallest talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then helps to sugar her bohea at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your reputation. I have known good wives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As chaste, or nearly so, as Potiphar's;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And good, good mothers, who would use a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better an intrigue; good friends, beside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Very good), who hung succinctly round your neck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sucked your breath, as cats are fabled to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sleeping infants. And we all have known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good critics who have stamped out poet's hope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good statesmen who pulled ruin on the state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good patriots who for a theory risked a cause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good kings who disembowelled for a tax,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good popes who brought all good to jeopardy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Christians who sat still in easy chairs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And damned the general world for standing up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now may the good God pardon all good men!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How bitterly I speak, how certainly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innocent white milk in us is turned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By much persistent shining of the sun!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shake up the sweetest in us long enough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With men, it drops to foolish curd, too sour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed the most untender of Christ's lambs.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have thought, a woman of the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like her I'm meaning, centre to herself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has wheeled on her own pivot half a life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In isolated self-love and self-will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a windmill seen at distance radiating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its delicate white vans against the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So soft and soundless, simply beautiful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen nearer, what a roar and tear it makes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How it grinds and bruises! if she loves at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her love's a re-adjustment of self-love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more, a need felt of another's use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her one advantage, as the mill wants grain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire wants fuel, the very wolf wants prey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none of these is more unscrupulous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than such a charming woman when she loves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She'll not be thwarted by an obstacle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So trifling as . . . her soul is, . . . much less yours!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is God a consideration? she loves you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not God; she will not flinch for Him indeed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not for the Marchioness of Perth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wanting tickets for the fancy ball.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loves you, sir, with passion, to lunacy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loves you like her diamonds . . . almost.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month passed so, and then the notice came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such a day the marriage at the church.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not backward.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half Saint Giles in frieze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was bidden to meet Saint James in cloth of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, after contract at the altar, pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To eat a marriage-feast on Hampstead Heath.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the people came in uncompelled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lame, blind, and worse sick, sorrowful, and worse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humours of the peccant social wound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All pressed out, poured down upon Pimlico,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exasperating the unaccustomed air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a hideous interfusion. You'd suppose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A finished generation, dead of plague,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept outward from their graves into the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moil of death upon them. What a sight!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A holiday of miserable men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sadder than a burial-day of kings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They clogged the streets, they oozed into the church
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dark slow stream, like blood. To see that sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble ladies stood up in their pews,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pale for fear, a few as red for hate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some simply curious, some just insolent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some in wondering scorn, "What next? what next?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These crushed their delicate rose-lips from the smile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That misbecame them in a holy place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With broidered hems of perfumed handkerchiefs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those passed the salts, with confidence of eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And simultaneous shiver of moiré silk:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all the aisles, alive and black with heads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crawled slowly toward the altar from the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As bruised snakes crawl and hiss out of a hole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With shuddering involution, swaying slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From right to left, and then from left to right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pants and pauses. What an ugly crest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of faces rose upon you everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that crammed mass! you did not usually
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See faces like them in the open day:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hide in cellars, not to make you mad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Romney Leigh is. Faces! O my God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We call those, faces? men's and women's . . . ay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And children's; babies, hanging like a rag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgotten on their mother's neck, poor mouths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiped clean of mother's milk by mother's blow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they are taught her cursing. Faces? . . . phew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll call them vices, festering to despairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sorrows, petrifying to vices: not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A finger-touch of God left whole on them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ruined, lost the countenance worn out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the garment, the will dissolute as the act,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passions loose and draggling in the dirt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To trip a foot up at the first free step!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those, faces? 'twas as if you had stirred up hell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To heave its lowest dreg-fiends uppermost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiery swirls of slime, such strangled fronts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such obdurate jaws were thrown up constantly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To twit you with your race, corrupt your blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grind to devilish colours all your dreams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, though, haply, you should drop asleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clink of silver waters, in a muse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Raffael's mild Madonna of the Bird.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've waked and slept through many nights and days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, but still that day will catch my breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a nightmare. There are fatal days, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which the fibrous years have taken root
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So deeply, that they quiver to their tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whene'er you stir the dust of such a day.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin met me with his eyes and hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, with just a word, . . . that "Marian Erle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was coming with her bridesmaids presently,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made haste to place me by the altar-stair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he and other noble gentlemen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And high-born ladies waited for the bride.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We waited. It was early: there was time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For greeting and the morning's compliment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gradually a ripple of women's talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arose and fell and tossed about a spray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of English s's, soft as a silent hush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, notwithstanding, quite as audible
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As louder phrases thrown out by the men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, really, if we need to wait in church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to talk there." "She? 'tis Lady Ayr,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In blue not purple! that's the dowager."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She looks as young" "She flirts as young, you mean.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, if you had seen her upon Thursday night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd call Miss Norris modest." "You again!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waltzed with you three hours back. Up at six,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up still at ten; scarce time to change one's shoes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel as white and sulky as a ghost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So pray don't speak to me, Lord Belcher." "No,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll look at you instead, and it's enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you have that face." "In church, my lord! fie, fie!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adair, you stayed for the Division?" "Lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By one." "The devil it is! I'm sorry for't.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I had not promised Mistress Grove" . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You might have kept your word to Liverpool."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Constituents must remember, after all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're mortal." "We remind them of it." "Hark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride comes! here she comes, in a stream of milk!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There? Dear, you are asleep still; don't you know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five Miss Granvilles? always dressed in white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show they're ready to be married." "Lower!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aunt is at your elbow." "Lady Maud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Lady Waldemar tell you she had seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl of Leigh's?" "No, wait! 'twas Mistress Brookes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who told me Lady Waldemar told her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, 'twasn't Mistress Brookes." "She's pretty?" "Who?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistress Brookes? Lady Waldemar?" "How hot!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray is't the law to-day we're not to breathe?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're treading on my shawl I thank you, sir."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They say the bride's a mere child, who can't read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But knows the things she shouldn't, with wide-awake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great eyes. I'd go through fire to look at her."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You do, I think." "And Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You see her; sitting close to Romney Leigh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beautiful she looks, a little flushed!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has taken up the girl, and methodised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leigh's folly. Should I have come here, you suppose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except she'd asked me?" "She'd have served him more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By marrying him herself."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah there she comes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride, at last!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indeed, no. Past eleven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puts off her patched petticoat to-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And puts on Mayfair manners, so begins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By setting us to wait." "Yes, yes, this Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was always odd; it's in the blood, I think;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father's uncle's cousin's second son
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was, was . . . you understand me; and for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's stark, has turned quite lunatic upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This modern question of the poor the poor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excellent subject when you're moderate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've seen Prince Albert's model lodging-house?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does honour to his Royal Highness. Good!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But would he stop his carriage in Cheapside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shake a common fellow by the fist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose name was . . . Shakespeare? No. We draw a line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we stand not by our order, we
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England, we fall headlong. Here's a sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hideous sight, a most indecent sight!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife would come, sir, or I had kept her back.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By heaven, sir, when poor Damiens' trunk and limbs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were torn by horses, women of the court
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood by and stared, exactly as to-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this dismembering of society,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pretty, troubled faces."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, at last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She comes now."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where? who sees? you push me, sir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the point of what is mannerly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're standing, madam, on my second flounce.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do beseech you . . ."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No it's not the bride.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-past eleven. How late. The bride-groom, mark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gets anxious and goes out."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And as I said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Leighs! our best blood running in the rut!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's something awful. We had pardoned him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple misalliance got up aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a pair of sky-blue eyes; the House of Lords
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has winked at such things, and we've all been young;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here's an intermarriage reasoned out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract (carried boldly to the light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To challenge observation, pioneer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good acts by a great example) 'twixt the extremes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of martyrised society, on the left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-born, on the right the merest mob,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To treat as equals! 'tis anarchical;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means more than it says; 'tis damnable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, sir, we can't have even our coffee good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we strain it."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here, Miss Leigh!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Howe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're Romney's friend. What's all this waiting for?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I cannot tell. The bride has lost her head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And way, perhaps!) to prove her sympathy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bridegroom."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, you also, disapprove!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I approve of nothing in the world,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, "not of you, still less of me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor even of Romney, though he's worth us both.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're all gone wrong. The tune in us is lost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whistling down back alleys to the moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will never catch it."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me draw Lord Howe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A born aristocrat, bred radical,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And educated socialist, who still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes floating, on traditions of his kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the theoretic flood from France,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though, like a drenched Noah on a rotten deck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce safer for his place there. He, at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will never land on Ararat, he knows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recommence the world on the new plan:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, he thinks, said world had better end.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sympathises rather with the fish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, than with the drowned paired beasts within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cannot couple again or multiply,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's the sort of Noah he is, Lord Howe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never could be anything complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except a loyal, upright gentleman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A liberal landlord, graceful diner-out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And entertainer more than hospitable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom authors dine with and forget the hock.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever he believes, and it is much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nowise certain, now here and now there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has sympathies beyond his creed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diverting him from action. In the House,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No party counts upon him, while for all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His speeches have a noticeable weight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men like his books too (he has written books),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, safe to lie beside a bishop's chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times outreach themselves with jets of fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which the foremost of the progressists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May warm audacious hands in passing by.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of stature over-tall, lounging for ease;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light hair, that seems to carry a wind in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eyes that, when they look on you, will lean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their whole weight, half in indolence and half
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In wishing you unmitigated good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until you know not if to flinch from him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thank him. 'Tis Lord Howe.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're all gone wrong,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he; "and Romney, that dear friend of ours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is nowise right. There's one true thing on earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's love! he takes it up, and dresses it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And acts a play with it, as Hamlet did,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show what cruel uncles we have been,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how we should be uneasy in our minds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he, Prince Hamlet, weds a pretty maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who keeps us too long waiting, we'll confess)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By symbol, to instruct us formally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fill the ditches up 'twixt class and class,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And live together in phalansteries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then? he's mad, our Hamlet! clap his play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bind him."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, Lord Howe, this spectacle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulls stronger at us than the Dane's. See there!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crammed aisles heave and strain and steam with life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear heaven, what life!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, yes, a poet sees;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes him different from a common man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, see somewhat, though I cannot sing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have been a poet, only that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother took fright at the ugly world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore me tongue-tied. If you'll grant me now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Romney gives us a fine actor-piece
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make us merry on his marriage-morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fable's worse than Hamlet's I'll concede.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrible people, old and poor and blind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their eyes eat out with plague and poverty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From seeing beautiful and cheerful sights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll liken to a brutalised King Lear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led out, by no means to clear scores with wrongs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wrongs are so far back, he has forgot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(All's past like youth); but just to witness here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple contract, he, upon his side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Regan with her sister Goneril
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the dappled courtiers and courtfools
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their side. Not that any of these would say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're sorry, neither. What is done, is done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And violence is now turned privilege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As cream turns cheese, if buried long enough.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could such lovely ladies have to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the old man there, in those ill-odorous rags,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except to keep the wind-side of him? Lear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is flat and quiet, as a decent grave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not curse his daughters in the least:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be these his daughters? Lear is thinking of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His porridge chiefly . . . is it getting cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Hampstead? will the ale be served in pots?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Lear, poor daughters! Bravo, Romney's play!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A murmur and a movement drew around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A naked whisper touched us. Something wrong.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's wrong? The black crowd, as an overstrained
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cord, quivered in vibration, and I saw . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that his face I saw? . . . his . . . Romney Leigh's . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which tossed a sudden horror like a sponge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into all eyes, while himself stood white upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topmost altar-stair and tried to speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And failed, and lifted higher above his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter, . . . as a man who drowns and gasps.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My brothers, bear with me! I am very weak.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I meant but only good. Perhaps I meant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too proudly, and God snatched the circumstance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And changed it therefore. There's no marriage none.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaves me, she departs, she disappears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lose her. Yet I never forced her 'ay,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have her 'no' so cast into my teeth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In manner of an accusation, thus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends, you are dismissed. Go, eat and drink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the programme, and farewell!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ended. There was silence in the church.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard a baby sucking in its sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the farthest end of the aisle. Then spoke a man:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, look to it, coves, that all the beef and drink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be not filched from us like the other fun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For beer's spilt easier than a woman's lost!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gentry is not honest with the poor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They bring us up, to trick us." "Go it, Jim,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman screamed back, "I'm a tender soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never banged a child at two years old
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drew blood from him, but I sobbed for it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next moment, and I've had a plague of seven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm tender; I've no stomach even for beef,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I know about the girl that's lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's killed, mayhap. I did misdoubt, at first,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine lord meant no good by her or us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, maybe, got the upper hand of her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By holding up a wedding-ring, and then . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A choking finger on her throat last night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just a clever tale to keep us still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she is, poor lost innocent. 'Disappear!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who ever disappears except a ghost?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who believes a story of a ghost?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask you, would a girl go off, instead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of staying to be married? a fine tale!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wicked man, I say, a wicked man!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I would rather starve on gin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than make my dinner on his beef and beer."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which a cry rose up "We'll have our rights.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll have the girl, the girl! Your ladies there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are married safely and smoothly every day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she shall not drop through into a trap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she's poor and of the people: shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll have no tricks played off by gentlefolk;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll see her righted."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the rage and roar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the broken words which Romney flung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the turbulent masses, from the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held still with his masterful pale face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As huntsmen throw the ration to the pack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, falling on it headlong, dog on dog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In heaps of fury, rend it, swallow it up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With yelling hound-jaws, his indignant words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His suppliant words, his most pathetic words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereof I caught the meaning here and there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his gesture . . . torn in morsels, yelled across,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so devoured. From end to end, the church
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocked round us like the sea in storm, and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke up like the earth in earthquake. Men cried out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Police" and women stood and shrieked for God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or dropped and swooned; or, like a herd of deer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For whom the black woods suddenly grow alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unleashing their wild shadows down the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hunt the creatures into corners, back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forward), madly fled, or blindly fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trod screeching underneath the feet of those
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fled and screeched.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sight left to me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Romney's terrible calm face above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumult! the last sound was "Pull him down!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike kill him!" Stretching my unreasoning arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men in dreams, who vainly interpose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt gods and their undoing, with a cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I struggled to precipitate myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head-foremost to the rescue of my soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that white face, . . . till some one caught me back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the world went out, I felt no more.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What followed was told after by Lord Howe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who bore me senseless from the strangling crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In church and street, and then returned alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the tumult quelled. The men of law
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had fallen as thunder on a roaring fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made all silent, while the people's smoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed eddying slowly from the emptied aisles.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's Marian's letter, which a ragged child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought running, just as Romney at the porch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked out expectant of the bride. He sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter to me by his friend Lord Howe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some two hours after, folded in a sheet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which his well-known hand had left a word.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's Marian's letter.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noble friend, dear saint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be patient with me. Never think me vile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who might to-morrow morning be your wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that I loved you more than such a name.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, my Romney. Let me write it once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Romney.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis so pretty a coupled word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no heart to pluck it with a blot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say 'my God' sometimes, upon our knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is not therefore vexed: so bear with it . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And me. I know I'm foolish, weak, and vain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet most of all I'm angry with myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For losing your last footstep on the stair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That last time of your coming, yesterday!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very first time I lost step of yours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Its sweetness comes the next to what you speak),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yesterday sobs took me by the throat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cut me off from music.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mister Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll set me down as wrong in many things.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've praised me, sir, for truth, and now you'll learn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not courage to be rightly true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once began to tell you how she came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman . . . and you stared upon the floor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of your fixed thoughts . . . which put me out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that day. After, some one spoke of me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wisely, and of you, so tenderly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuading me to silence for your sake . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, well! it seems this moment I was wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping back from telling you the truth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There might be truth betwixt us two, at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If nothing else. And yet 'twas dangerous.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose a real angel came from heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live with men and women! he'd go mad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no considerate hand should tie a blind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across his piercing eyes. 'Tis thus with you:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see us too much in your heavenly light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always thought so, angel, and indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's danger that you beat yourself to death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the edges of this alien world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some divine and fluttering pity.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be dreadful for a friend of yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see all England thrust you out of doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mock you from the windows. You might say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or think (that's worse) 'There's some one in the house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss and love still.' Dreadful!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray you mark, was Lady Waldemar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came to see me nine times, rather ten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So beautiful, she hurts one like the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let suddenly on sick eyes.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most kind of all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your cousin! ah, most like you! Ere you came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kissed me mouth to mouth: I felt her soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dip through her serious lips in holy fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God help me, but it made me arrogant;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost told her that you would not lose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By taking me to wife: though ever since
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've pondered much a certain thing she asked . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He loves you, Marian?' . . . in a sort of mild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derisive sadness . . . as a mother asks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her babe, 'You'll touch that star, you think?'


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I never touched it.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is worst:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babes grow and lose the hope of things above;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver threepence sets them leaping high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no more stars! mark that.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've writ all night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet told you nothing. God, if I could die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let this letter break off innocent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just here! But no for your sake.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here's the last:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never could be happy as your wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never could be harmless as your friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never will look more into your face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till God says 'Look!' I charge you, seek me not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor vex yourself with lamentable thoughts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That peradventure I have come to grief;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure I'm well, I'm merry, I'm at ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a long way, long way, long way off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you'll find me sooner in my grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's my choice, observe. For what remains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An over-generous friend will care for me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep me happy . . . happier . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's a blot!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ink runs thick . . . we light girls lightly weep . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep me happier . . . was the thing to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than as your wife I could be. O, my star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My saint, my soul! for surely you're my soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through whom God touched me! I am not so lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot thank you for the good you did,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears you stopped, which fell down bitterly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like these the times you made me weep for joy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At hoping I should learn to write your notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And save the tiring of your eyes, at night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most for that sweet thrice you kissed my lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying 'Dear Marian.'


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Twould be hard to read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter, for a reader half as learn'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you'll be sure to master it in spite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ups and downs. My hand shakes, I am blind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm poor at writing at the best, and yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to make my g's the way you showed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell. Christ love you. Say 'poor Marian' now."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Marian! wanton Marian! was it so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or so? For days, her touching, foolish lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We mused on with conjectural fantasy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if some riddle of a summer-cloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which one tries unlike similitudes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of now a spotted Hydra-skin cast off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now a screen of carven ivory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shuts the heavens' conventual secrets up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From mortals overbold. We sought the sense:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loved him so perhaps (such words mean love),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, worked on by some shrewd perfidious tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And then I thought of Lady Waldemar),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She left him, not to hurt him; or perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loved one in her class, or did not love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mused upon her wild bad tramping life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the free blood fluttered at her heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And black bread eaten by the roadside hedge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed sweeter than being put to Romney's school
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of philanthropical self-sacrifice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrevocably. Girls are girls, beside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought I, and like a wedding by one rule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seldom catch these birds except with chaff:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feel it almost an immoral thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go out and be married in broad day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless some winning special flattery should
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excuse them to themselves for't, . . . "No one parts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair with such a silver line as you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else . . . "You bite your lip in such a way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It spoils me for the smiling of the rest,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so on. Then a worthless gaud or two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep for love, a ribbon for the neck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or some glass pin, they have their weight with girls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Romney sought her many days and weeks:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sifted all the refuse of the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explored the trains, inquired among the ships,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt the country through from end to end;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Marian! Though I hinted what I knew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of his had reasons of her own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For throwing back the match he would not hear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady had been ailing ever since,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock had harmed her. Something in his tone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repressed me; something in me shamed my doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a sigh repressed too. He went on to say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, putting questions where his Marian lodged,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found she had received for visitors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides himself and Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, that once, me a dubious woman dressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond us both: the rings upon her hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had dazed the children when she threw them pence;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She wore her bonnet as the queen might hers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show the crown," they said, "a scarlet crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of roses that had never been in bud."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Romney told me that, for now and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to tell me how the search advanced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice dropped: I bent forward for the rest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman had been with her, it appeared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first from week to week, then day by day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And last, 'twas sure . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked upon the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To escape the anguish of his eyes, and asked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As low as when you speak to mourners new
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those they cannot bear yet to call dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Marian had as much as named to him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain Rose, an early friend of hers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ruined creature."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never." Starting up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strode from side to side about the room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like some prisoned lion sprung awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has felt the desert sting him through his dreams.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was I to her, that she should tell me aught?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend! was I a friend? I see all clear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such devils would pull angels out of heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided they could reach them; 'tis their pride;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's the odds 'twixt soul and body plague!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veriest slave who drops in Cairo's street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cries 'Stand off from me' to the passengers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these blotched souls are eager to infect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blow their bad breath in a sister's face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they got some ease by it."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I broke through.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some natures catch no plagues. I've read of babes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found whole and sleeping by the spotted breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one a full day dead. I hold it true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I'm a woman and know womanhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Marian Erle, however lured from place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deceived in way, keeps pure in aim and heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As snow that's drifted from the garden-bank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the open road."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas hard to hear him laugh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The figure's happy. Well a dozen carts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trampers will secure you presently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine white snow-drift. Leave it there, your snow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twill pass for soot ere sunset. Pure in aim?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's pure in aim, I grant you, like myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thought to take the world upon my back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry it o'er a chasm of social ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And end by letting slip through impotence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single soul, a child's weight in a soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight down the pit of hell! yes, I and she
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have reason to be proud of our pure aims."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then softly, as the last repenting drops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a thunder-shower, he added, "The poor child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Marian! 'twas a luckless day for her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first she chanced on my philanthropy."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew a chair beside me, and sat down;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, instinctively, as women use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a sweet friend's grief, when, in his ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hum the tune of comfort though themselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most ignorant of the special words of such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quiet so and fortify his brain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And give it time and strength for feeling out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach the availing sense beyond that sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went murmuring to him what, if written here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would seem not much, yet fetched him better help
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than peradventure if it had been more.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've known the pregnant thinkers of our time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood by breathless, hanging on their lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some chromatic sequence of fine thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In learned modulation phrased itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To an unconjectured harmony of truth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I've been more moved, more raised, I say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a simple word . . . a broken easy thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A three-years' infant might at need repeat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look, a sigh, a touch upon the palm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which meant less than "I love you," than by all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-voiced rhetoric of those master-mouths.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, dear Aurora," he began at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pale lips fumbling for a sort of smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your printer's devils have not spoilt your heart:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's well. And who knows but, long years ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you and I talked, you were somewhat right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In being so peevish with me? You, at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have ruined no one through your dreams. Instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've helped the facile youth to live youth's day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With innocent distraction, still perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggestive of things better than your rhymes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little shepherd-maiden, eight years old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen upon the mountains of Vaucluse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asleep i' the sun, her head upon her knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flocks all scattered, is more laudable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any sheep-dog, trained imperfectly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who bites the kids through too much zeal."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I had slept, then?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was touched at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By something in my face. Indeed 'twas sure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he and I, despite a year or two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of younger life on my side, and on his
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heaping of the years' work on the days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-hour speeches from the member's seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot committees in and out of doors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pamphlets, "Arguments," "Collective Views,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tossed out as straw before sick houses, just
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show one's sick and so be trod to dirt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no more use, through this world's underground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burrowing, groping effort, whence the arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heart come torn, 'twas sure that he and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were, after all, unequally fatigued;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he, in his developed manhood, stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little sunburnt by the glare of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I . . . it seemed no sun had shone on me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many seasons I had missed my Springs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cheeks had pined and perished from their orbs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the youth-blood in them had grown white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dew on autumn cyclamens: alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes and forehead answered for my face.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "Aurora, you are changed are ill!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so, my cousin, only not asleep,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered, smiling gently. "Let it be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You scarcely found the poet of Vaucluse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As drowsy as the shepherds. What is art
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But life upon the larger scale, the higher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, graduating up in a spiral line
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of still expanding and ascending gyres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It pushes toward the intense significance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all things, hungry for the Infinite?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art's life, and where we live, we suffer and toil."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed to sift me with his painful eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You take it gravely, cousin; you refuse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dreamland's right of common, and green rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You break the mythic turf where danced the nymphs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With crooked ploughs of actual life, let in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The axes to the legendary woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay the poll-tax. You are fallen indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On evil days, you poets, if yourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can praise that art of yours no otherwise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if you cannot, . . . better take a trade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be of use: 'twere cheaper for your youth."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of use!" I softly echoed, "there's the point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sweep about for ever in argument,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like swallows which the exasperate, dying year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets spinning in black circles, round and round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing for far flights o'er unknown seas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we, where tend we?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" he said, and sighed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole creation, from the hour we are born,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perplexes us with questions. Not a stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cries behind us, every weary step,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where, where?' I leave stones to reply to stones.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough for me and for my fleshly heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hearken the invocations of my kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When men catch hold upon my shuddering nerves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shriek 'What help? what hope? what bread i' the house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What fire i' the frost?' There must be some response,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though mine fail utterly. This social Sphinx
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sits between the sepulchres and stews,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes mock and mow against the crystal heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bullies God, exacts a word at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From each man standing on the side of God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However paying a sphinx-price for it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pay it also if we hold our peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pangs and pity. Let me speak and die.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, you'll say I speak and kill instead."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pressed in there. "The best men, doing their best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know peradventure least of what they do:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men usefullest i' the world are simply used;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail that holds the wood must pierce it first,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And He alone who wields the hammer sees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work advanced by the earliest blow. Take heart."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, if I could have taken yours!" he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that's past now." Then rising, "I will take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least your kindness and encouragement.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you. Dear, be happy. Sing your songs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's your way! but sometimes slumber too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor tire too much with following, out of breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhymes upon your mountains of Delight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflect, if Art be in truth the higher life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need the lower life to stand upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reach up unto that higher;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none can stand a-tip toe in the place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot stand in with two stable feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember then! for Art's sake, hold your life."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We parted so. I held him in respect.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I comprehended what he was in heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sacrificial greatness. Ay, but he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposed me a thing too small, to deign to know:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blew me, plainly, from the crucible
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some intruding, interrupting fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not worth the pains of his analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absorbed on nobler subjects. Hurt a fly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would not for the world: he's pitiful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To flies even. "Sing," says he, "and tease me still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's your way, poor insect." That's your way!

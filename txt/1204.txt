<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of writing many books there is no end;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I who have written much in prose and verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For others' uses, will write now for mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will write my story for my better self,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when you paint your portrait for a friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who keeps it in a drawer and looks at it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long after he has ceased to love you, just
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold together what he was and is.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, writing thus, am still what men call young;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not so far left the coasts of life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To travel inland, that I cannot hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That murmur of the outer Infinite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which unweaned babies smile at in their sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wondered at for smiling; not so far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still I catch my mother at her post
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the nursery door, with finger up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hush, hush here's too much noise!" while her sweet eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leap forward, taking part against her word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the child's riot. Still I sit and feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father's slow hand, when she had left us both,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stroke out my childish curls across his knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear Assunta's daily jest (she knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He liked it better than a better jest)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquire how many golden scudi went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make such ringlets. O my father's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stroke heavily, heavily the poor hair down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw, press the child's head closer to thy knee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm still too young, too young, to sit alone.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I write. My mother was a Florentine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose rare blue eyes were shut from seeing me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When scarcely I was four years old, my life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poor spark snatched up from a failing lamp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which went out therefore. She was weak and frail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not bear the joy of giving life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's rapture slew her. If her kiss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had left a longer weight upon my lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have steadied the uneasy breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reconciled and fraternised my soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new order. As it was, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt a mother-want about the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still went seeking, like a bleating lamb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left out at night in shutting up the fold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As restless as a nest-deserted bird
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown chill through something being away, though what
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It knows not. I, Aurora Leigh, was born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make my father sadder, and myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not overjoyous, truly. Women know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to rear up children (to be just),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know a simple, merry, tender knack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tying sashes, fitting baby-shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stringing pretty words that make no sense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissing full sense into empty words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which things are corals to cut life upon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although such trifles: children learn by such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's holy earnest in a pretty play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And get not over-early solemnised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing, as in a rose-bush, Love's Divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which burns and hurts not, not a single bloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become aware and unafraid of Love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such good do mothers. Fathers love as well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine did, I know, but still with heavier brains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wills more consciously responsible,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not as wisely, since less foolishly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So mothers have God's license to be missed.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was an austere Englishman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, after a dry lifetime spent at home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In college-learning, law, and parish talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was flooded with a passion unaware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His whole provisioned and complacent past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drowned out from him that moment. As he stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Florence, where he had come to spend a month
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And note the secret of Da Vinci's drains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He musing somewhat absently perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some English question . . . whether men should pay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unpopular but necessary tax
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With left or right hand in the alien sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that great square of the Santissima
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There drifted past him (scarcely marked enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move his comfortable island scorn)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A train of priestly banners, cross and psalm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-veiled rose-crowned maidens holding up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall tapers, weighty for such wrists, aslant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the blue luminous tremor of the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And letting drop the white wax as they went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To eat the bishop's wafer at the church;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which long trail of chanting priests and girls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A face flashed like a cymbal on his face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook with silent clangour brain and heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfiguring him to music. Thus, even thus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He too received his sacramental gift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eucharistic meanings; for he loved.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus beloved, she died. I've heard it said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That but to see him in the first surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of widower and father, nursing me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmothered little child of four years old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His large man's hands afraid to touch my curls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the gold would tarnish, his grave lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contriving such a miserable smile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he knew needs must, or I should die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet 'twas hard, would almost make the stones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry out for pity. There's a verse he set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Santa Croce to her memory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weep for an infant too young to weep much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When death removed this mother" stops the mirth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day on women's faces when they walk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rosy children hanging on their gowns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cloister to escape the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scorches in the piazza. After which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left our Florence and made haste to hide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself, his prattling child, and silent grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the mountains above Pelago;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because unmothered babes, he thought, had need
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mother nature more than others use,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pan's white goats, with udders warm and full
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mystic contemplations, come to feed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor milkless lips of orphans like his own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such scholar-scraps he talked, I've heard from friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For even prosaic men who wear grief long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will get to wear it as a hat aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a flower stuck in't. Father, then, and child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lived among the mountains many years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's silence on the outside of the house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we who did not speak too loud within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And old Assunta to make up the fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing herself whene'er a sudden flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which lightened from the firewood, made alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That picture of my mother on the wall.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painter drew it after she was dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the face was finished, throat and hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cameriera carried him, in hate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the English-fashioned shroud, the last brocade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dressed in at the Pitti; "he should paint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sadder thing than that," she swore, "to wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her poor signora." Therefore very strange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect was. I, a little child, would crouch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hours upon the floor with knees drawn up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gaze across them, half in terror, half
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In adoration, at the picture there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That swan-like supernatural white life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just sailing upward from the red stiff silk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seemed to have no part in it nor power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep it from quite breaking out of bounds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hours I sat and stared. Assunta's awe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my poor father's melancholy eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still pointed that way. That way went my thoughts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wandering beyond sight. And as I grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In years, I mixed, confused, unconsciously,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever I last read or heard or dreamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abhorrent, admirable, beautiful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pathetical, or ghastly, or grotesque,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With still that face . . . which did not therefore change,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But kept the mystic level of all forms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hates, fears, and admirations, was by turns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost, fiend, and angel, fairy, witch, and sprite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dauntless Muse who eyes a dreadful Fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loving Psyche who loses sight of Love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A still Medusa with mild milky brows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All curdled and all clothed upon with snakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose slime falls fast as sweat will; or anon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Lady of the Passion, stabbed with swords
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Babe sucked; or Lamia in her first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moonlighted pallor, ere she shrunk and blinked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shuddering wriggled down to the unclean;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or my own mother, leaving her last smile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her last kiss upon the baby-mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father pushed down on the bed for that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or my dead mother, without smile or kiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried at Florence. All which images,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concentred on the picture, glassed themselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my meditative childhood, as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incoherencies of change and death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are represented fully, mixed and merged,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smooth fair mystery of perpetual Life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while I stared away my childish wits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my mother's picture (ah, poor child!),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father, who through love had suddenly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrown off the old conventions, broken loose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From chin-bands of the soul, like Lazarus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet had no time to learn to talk and walk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or grow anew familiar with the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had reached to freedom, not to action, lived,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lived as one entranced, with thoughts, not aims,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom love had unmade from a common man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not completed to an uncommon man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father taught me what he had learnt the best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he died and left me, grief and love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, seeing we had books among the hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong words of counselling souls confederate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With vocal pines and waters, out of books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He taught me all the ignorance of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how God laughs in heaven when any man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says "Here I'm learned; this, I understand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that, I am never caught at fault or doubt."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent the schools to school, demonstrating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fool will pass for such through one mistake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a philosopher will pass for such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through said mistakes being ventured in the gross
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heaped up to a system.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am like,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tell me, my dear father. Broader brows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howbeit, upon a slenderer undergrowth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of delicate features, paler, near as grave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then my mother's smile breaks up the whole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes it better sometimes than itself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, nine full years, our days were hid with God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among his mountains: I was just thirteen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still growing like the plants from unseen roots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tongue-tied Springs, and suddenly awoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To full life and life's needs and agonies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes awful lightning. His last word was "Love "
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love, my child, love, love!" (then he had done with grief)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love, my child." Ere I answered he was gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none was left to love in all the world.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, ended childhood. What succeeded next
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recollect as, after fevers, men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thread back the passage of delirium,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing the turn still, baffled by the door;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth endless days, notched here and there with knives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A weary, wormy darkness, spurred i' the flank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flame, that it should eat and end itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some tormented scorpion. Then at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do remember clearly how there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger with authority, not right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I thought not), who commanded, caught me up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From old Assunta's neck; how, with a shriek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She let me go, while I, with ears too full
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my father's silence to shriek back a word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all a child's astonishment at grief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stared at the wharf-edge where she stood and moaned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white walls, the blue hills, my Italy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn backward from the shuddering steamer-deck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one in anger drawing back her skirts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which suppliants catch at. Then the bitter sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexorably pushed between us both
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, sweeping up the ship with my despair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw us out as a pasture to the stars.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten nights and days we voyaged on the deep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten nights and days without the common face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of any day or night; the moon and sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut off from the green reconciling earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To starve into a blind ferocity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And glare unnatural; the very sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Dropping its bell-net down upon the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if no human heart should 'scape alive)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedraggled with the desolating salt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it seemed no more that holy heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which my father went. All new and strange;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universe turned stranger, for a child.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, land! then, England! oh, the frosty cliffs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked cold upon me. Could I find a home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those mean red houses through the fog?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I heard my father's language first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From alien lips which had no kiss for mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some one near me said the child was mad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through much sea-sickness. The train swept us on:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this my father's England? the great isle?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground seemed cut up from the fellowship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of verdure, field from field, as man from man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skies themselves looked low and positive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As almost you could touch them with a hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dared to do it they were so far off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From God's celestial crystals; all things blurred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dull and vague. Did Shakespeare and his mates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absorb the light here? not a hill or stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With heart to strike a radiant colour up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or active outline on the indifferent air.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I see my father's sister stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the hall-step of her country-house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if for taming accidental thoughts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From possible pulses; brown hair pricked with gray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By frigid use of life (she was not old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although my father's elder by a year),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nose drawn sharply, yet in delicate lines;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A close mild mouth, a little soured about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ends, through speaking unrequited loves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or peradventure niggardly half-truths;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes of no colour, once they might have smiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never, never have forgot themselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In smiling; cheeks, in which was yet a rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of perished summers, like a rose in a book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept more for ruth than pleasure, if past bloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past fading also.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had lived, we'll say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A harmless life, she called a virtuous life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet life, which was not life at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(But that, she had not lived enough to know),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the vicar and the county squires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the empyrean to assure their souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against chance vulgarisms, and, in the abyss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apothecary, looked on once a year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove their soundness of humility.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor-club exercised her Christian gifts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of knitting stockings, stitching petticoats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are of one flesh, after all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And need one flannel (with a proper sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of difference in the quality) and still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book-club, guarded from your modern trick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shaking dangerous questions from the crease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preserved her intellectual. She had lived
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting that to leap from perch to perch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was act and joy enough for any bird.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear heaven, how silly are the things that live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thickets, and eat berries!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, alas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she was there to meet me. Very kind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring the clean water, give out the fresh seed.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood upon the steps to welcome me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young babes, who catch at every shred of wool
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw the new light closer, catch and cling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less blindly. In my ears my father's word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love, love, my child." She, black there with my grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might feel my love she was his sister once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I clung to her. A moment she seemed moved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drew me feebly through the hall into
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room she sat in.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, with some strange spasm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperiously, and held me at arm's length,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searched through my face, ay, stabbed it through and through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wicked murderer in my innocent face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggled for her ordinary calm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And missed it rather, told me not to shrink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she had told me not to lie or swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She loved my father and would love me too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as I deserved it." Very kind.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understood her meaning afterward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought to find my mother in my face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And questioned it for that. For she, my aunt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had loved my father truly, as she could,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hated, with the gall of gentle souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Tuscan mother who had fooled away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wise man from wise courses, a good man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From obvious duties, and, depriving her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sister, of the household precedence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had wronged his tenants, robbed his native land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made him mad, alike by life and death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In love and sorrow. She had pored for years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of woman could be suitable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her sort of hate, to entertain it with,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, her very curiosity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Became hate too, and all the idealism
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ever used in life was used for hate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till hate, so nourished, did exceed at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love from which it grew, in strength and heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrinkled her smooth conscience with a sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of disputable virtue (say not, sin)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Christian doctrine was enforced at church.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus my father's sister was to me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother's hater. From that day she did
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her duty to me (I appreciate it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her own word as spoken to herself),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her duty, in large measure, well pressed out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But measured always. She was generous, bland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More courteous than was tender, gave me still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first place, as if fearful that God's saints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would look down suddenly and say "Herein
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You missed a point, I think, through lack of love."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, a mother never is afraid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of speaking angerly to any child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since love, she knows, is justified of love.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, I was a good child on the whole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meek and manageable child. Why not?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not live, to have the faults of life:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seemed more true life in my father's grave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than in all England. Since that threw me off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fain would cleave (his latest will, they say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consigned me to his land), I only thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lying quiet there where I was thrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sea-weed on the rocks, and suffering her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prick me to a pattern with her pin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fibre from fibre, delicate leaf from leaf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dry out from my drowned anatomy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sea-salt left in me.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I broke the copious curls upon my head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In braids, because she liked smooth-ordered hair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left off saying my sweet Tuscan words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which still at any stirring of the heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came up to float across the English phrase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lilies (Bene or Che che), because
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She liked my father's child to speak his tongue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt the collects and the catechism,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creeds, from Athanasius back to Nice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Articles, the Tracts against the times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(By no means Buonaventure's "Prick of Love"),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And various popular synopses of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inhuman doctrines never taught by John,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she liked instructed piety.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt my complement of classic French
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Kept pure of Balzac and neologism)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And German also, since she liked a range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of liberal education, tongues, not books.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt a little algebra, a little
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the mathematics, brushed with extreme flounce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circle of the sciences, because
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She misliked women who are frivolous.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt the royal genealogies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Oviedo, the internal laws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Burmese empire, by how many feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mount Chimborazo outsoars Teneriffe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What navigable river joins itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Lara, and what census of the year five
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was taken at Klagenfurt, because she liked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general insight into useful facts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt much music, such as would have been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As quite impossible in Johnson's day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As still it might be wished fine sleights of hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unimagined fingering, shuffling off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearer's soul through hurricanes of notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a noisy Tophet; and I drew . . . costumes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From French engravings, nereids neatly draped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(With smirks of simmering godship): I washed in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landscapes from nature (rather say, washed out).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I danced the polka and Cellarius,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spun glass, stuffed birds, and modelled flowers in wax,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she liked accomplishments in girls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read a score of books on womanhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove, if women do not think at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may teach thinking (to a maiden aunt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else the author), books that boldly assert
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their right of comprehending husband's talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When not too deep, and even of answering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pretty "may it please you," or "so it is,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their rapid insight and fine aptitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Particular worth and general missionariness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as they keep quiet by the fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never say "no" when the world says "ay,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that is fatal, their angelic reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of virtue, chiefly used to sit and darn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fatten household sinners, their, in brief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential faculty in everything
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of abdicating power in it: she owned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She liked a woman to be womanly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And English women, she thanked God and sighed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Some people always sigh in thanking God),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were models to the universe. And last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt cross-stitch, because she did not like
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see me wear the night with empty hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-doing nothing. So, my shepherdess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was something after all (the pastoral saints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be praised for't), leaning lovelorn with pink eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To match her shoes, when I mistook the silks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her head uncrushed by that round weight of hat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So strangely similar to the tortoise-shell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which slew the tragic poet.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The works of women are symbolical.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sew, sew, prick our fingers, dull our sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producing what? A pair of slippers, sir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put on when you're weary or a stool
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stumble over and vex you . . . "curse that stool!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else at best, a cushion, where you lean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleep, and dream of something we are not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But would be for your sake. Alas, alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hurts most, this that, after all, we are paid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worth of our work, perhaps.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In looking down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those years of education (to return)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if Brinvilliers suffered more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the water-torture . . . flood succeeding flood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drench the incapable throat and split the veins . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I did. Certain of your feebler souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go out in such a process; many pine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a sick, inodorous light; my own endured:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had relations in the Unseen, and drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental nutriment and heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From nature, as earth feels the sun at nights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as a babe sucks surely in the dark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept the life thrust on me, on the outside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the inner life with all its ample room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For heart and lungs, for will and intellect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inviolable by conventions. God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank thee for that grace of thine!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt no life which was not patience, did
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing she bade me, without heed to a thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond it, sat in just the chair she placed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With back against the window, to exclude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sight of the great lime-tree on the lawn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seemed to have come on purpose from the woods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring the house a message, ay, and walked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demurely in her carpeted low rooms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I should not, hearkening my own steps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misdoubt I was alive. I read her books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was civil to her cousin, Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave ear to her vicar, tea to her visitors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard them whisper, when I changed a cup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I blushed for joy at that), "The Italian child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all her blue eyes and her quiet ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrives ill in England: she is paler yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when we came the last time; she will die."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will die." My cousin, Romney Leigh, blushed too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sudden anger, and approaching me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said low between his teeth, "You're wicked now?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wish to die and leave the world a-dusk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For others, with your naughty light blown out?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked into his face defyingly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might have known that, being what I was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas natural to like to get away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as dead folk can: and then indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people make no trouble when they die.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and went abruptly, slammed the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shut his dog out.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romney, Romney Leigh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not named my cousin hitherto,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I used him as a sort of friend;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My elder by few years, but cold and shy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And absent . . . tender, when he thought of it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which scarcely was imperative, grave betimes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as early master of Leigh Hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereof the nightmare sat upon his youth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repressing all its seasonable delights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And agonising with a ghastly sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of universal hideous want and wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To incriminate possession. When he came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From college to the country, very oft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crossed the hill on visits to my aunt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With gifts of blue grapes from the hothouses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book in one hand, mere statistics (if
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chanced to lift the cover), count of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goats whose beards grow sprouting down toward hell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against God's separative judgment-hour.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she, she almost loved him, even allowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sometimes he should seem to sigh my way;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made him easier to be pitiful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sighing was his gift. So, undisturbed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At whiles she let him shut my music up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And push my needles down, and lead me out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see in that south angle of the house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figs grow black as if by a Tuscan rock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On some light pretext. She would turn her head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At other moments, go to fetch a thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave me breath enough to speak with him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his sake; it was simple.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would have saved me utterly, it seemed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood and looked so.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, he stood so near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped a sudden hand upon my head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent down on woman's work, as soft as rain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then I rose and shook it off as fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger's touch that took my father's place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet dared seem soft.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used him for a friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I ever knew him for a friend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas better, 'twas worse also, afterward:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came so close, we saw our differences
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too intimately. Always Romney Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was looking for the worms, I for the gods.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A godlike nature his; the gods look down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incurious of themselves; and certainly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis well I should remember, how, those days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a worm too, and he looked on me.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little by his act perhaps, yet more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By something in me, surely not my will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not die. But slowly, as one in swoon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom life creeps back in the form of death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sense of separation, a blind pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of blank obstruction, and a roar i' the ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of visionary chariots which retreat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As earth grows clearer . . . slowly, by degrees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I woke, rose up . . . where was I? in the world;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For uses therefore I must count worth while.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a little chamber in the house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As green as any privet-hedge a bird
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might choose to build in, though the nest itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could show but dead-brown sticks and straws; the walls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were green, the carpet was pure green, the straight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small bed was curtained greenly, and the folds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung green about the window which let in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The out-door world with all its greenery.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could not push your head out and escape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dash of dawn-dew from the honeysuckle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so you were baptized into the grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And privilege of seeing. . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the lime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I had enough there, of the lime, be sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My morning-dream was often hummed away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the bees in it); past the lime, the lawn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, after sweeping broadly round the house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went trickling through the shrubberies in a stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tender turf, and wore and lost itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the acacias, over which you saw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irregular line of elms by the deep lane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which stopped the grounds and dammed the overflow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of arbutus and laurel. Out of sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lane was; sunk so deep, no foreign tramp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor drover of wild ponies out of Wales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could guess if lady's hall or tenant's lodge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispensed such odours, though his stick well-crooked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might reach the lowest trail of blossoming briar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which dipped upon the wall. Behind the elms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through their tops, you saw the folded hills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Striped up and down with hedges (burly oaks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projecting from the line to show themselves),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through which my cousin Romney's chimneys smoked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As still as when a silent mouth in frost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathes, showing where the woodlands hid Leigh Hall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, far above, a jut of table-land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A promontory without water, stretched,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could not catch it if the days were thick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or took it for a cloud; but, otherwise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigorous sun would catch it up at eve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And use it for an anvil till he had filled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shelves of heaven with burning thunderbolts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protesting against night and darkness: then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all his setting trouble was resolved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a trance of passive glory, you might see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In apparition on the golden sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Alas, my Giotto's background!) the sheep run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the fine clear outline, small as mice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That run along a witch's scarlet thread.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a grand nature. Not my chestnut-woods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Vallombrosa, cleaving by the spurs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the precipices. Not my headlong leaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of waters, that cry out for joy or fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leaping through the palpitating pines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a white soul tossed out to eternity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thrills of time upon it. Not indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My multitudinous mountains, sitting in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic circle, with the mutual touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electric, panting from their full deep hearts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the influent heavens, and waiting for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communion and commission. Italy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is one thing, England one.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On English ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You understand the letter, ere the fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Adam lived in a garden. All the fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are tied up fast with hedges, nosegay-like;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills are crumpled plains, the plains parterres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees, round, woolly, ready to be clipped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you seek for any wilderness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You find, at best, a park. A nature tamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grown domestic like a barn-door fowl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which does not awe you with its claws and beak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor tempt you to an eyrie too high up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But which, in cackling, sets you thinking of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your eggs to-morrow at breakfast, in the pause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of finer meditation.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweet familiar nature, stealing in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a dog might, or child, to touch your hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or pluck your gown, and humbly mind you so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of presence and affection, excellent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For inner uses, from the things without.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not be unthankful, I who was
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entreated thus and holpen. In the room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak of, ere the house was well awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also after it was well asleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat alone, and drew the blessing in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that nature. With a gradual step,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stir among the leaves, a breath, a ray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came in softly, while the angels made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place for it beside me. The moon came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swept my chamber clean of foolish thoughts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came, saying, "Shall I lift this light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the lime-tree, and you will not look?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make the birds sing listen! but, for you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God never hears your voice, excepting when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You lie upon the bed at nights and weep."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, something moved me. Then, I wakened up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More slowly than I verily write now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wholly, at last, I wakened, opened wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window and my soul, and let the airs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out-door sights sweep gradual gospels in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regenerating what I was. O Life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How oft we throw it off and think, "Enough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough of life in so much! here's a cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rupture; herein we must break with Life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or be ourselves unworthy; here we are wronged,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maimed, spoiled for aspiration: farewell, Life!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, as froward babes, we hide our eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think all ended. Then, Life calls to us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some transformed, apocalyptic voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above us, or below us, or around:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we name it Nature's voice, or Love's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tricking ourselves, because we are more ashamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To own our compensations than our griefs:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, Life's voice! still, we make our peace with Life.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, so young then, was not sullen. Soon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to get up early, just to sit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch the morning quicken in the gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the silence open like a flower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaf after leaf, and stroke with listless hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woodbine through the window, till at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to do it with a sort of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At foolish unaware: whereat I smiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A melancholy smile, to catch myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling for joy.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capacity for joy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admits temptation. It seemed, next, worth while
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dodge the sharp sword set against my life;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To slip down stairs through all the sleepy house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mute as any dream there, and escape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a soul from the body, out of doors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glide through the shrubberies, drop into the lane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wander on the hills an hour or two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then back again before the house should stir.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else I sat on in my chamber green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lived my life, and thought my thoughts, and prayed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My prayers without the vicar; read my books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without considering whether they were fit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do me good. Mark, there. We get no good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By being ungenerous, even to a book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And calculating profits, so much help
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By so much reading. It is rather when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We gloriously forget ourselves and plunge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soul-forward, headlong, into a book's profound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impassioned for its beauty and salt of truth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis then we get the right good from a book.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read much. What my father taught before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From many a volume, Love re-emphasised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the self-same pages: Theophrast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew tender with the memory of his eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ælian made mine wet. The trick of Greek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Latin he had taught me, as he would
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have taught me wrestling or the game of fives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such he had known, most like a shipwrecked man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who heaps his single platter with goats' cheese
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scarlet berries; or like any man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loves but one, and so gives all at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has it, rather than because
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He counts it worthy. Thus, my father gave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, as did the women formerly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By young Achilles, when they pinned a veil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the boy's audacious front, and swept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tuneful laughs the silver-fretted rocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrapt his little daughter in his large
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man's doublet, careless did it fit or no.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, after I had read for memory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read for hope. The path my father's foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had trod me out (which suddenly broke off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time he dropped the wallet of the flesh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed), alone I carried on, and set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My child-heart 'gainst the thorny underwood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach the grassy shelter of the trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah babe i' the wood, without a brother-babe!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own self-pity, like the red-breast bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flies back to cover all that past with leaves.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublimest danger, over which none weeps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any young wayfaring soul goes forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, unconscious of the perilous road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day-sun dazzling in his limpid eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thrust his own way, he an alien, through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of books! Ah, you! you think it fine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You clap hands "A fair day!" you cheer him on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the worst, could happen, were to rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too long beside a fountain. Yet, behold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold! the world of books is still the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And worldings in it are less merciful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more puissant. For the wicked there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are winged like angels; every knife that strikes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is edged from elemental fire to assail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spiritual life; the beautiful seems right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By force of beauty, and the feeble wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of weakness; power is justified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though armed against Saint Michael; many a crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covers bald foreheads. In the book-world, true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no lack, neither, of God's saints and kings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shake the ashes of the grave aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their calm locks and undiscomfited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look steadfast truths against Time's changing mask.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, many a prophet teaches in the roads;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, many a seer pulls down the flaming heavens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his own head in strong martyrdom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to light men a moment's space.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stay! who judges? who distinguishes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt Saul and Nahash justly, at first sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves king Saul precisely at the sin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve king David? who discerns at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the trumpets, when the trumpets blow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Alaric as well as Charlemagne?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who judges wizards, and can tell true seers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From conjurers? the child, there? Would you leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That child to wander in a battle-field
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And push his innocent smile against the guns;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or even in a catacomb, his torch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown ragged in the fluttering air, and all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark a-mutter round him? not a child.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read books bad and good some bad and good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At once (good aims not always make good books:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-tempered spades turn up ill-smelling soils
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In digging vineyards even); books that prove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's being so definitely, that man's doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows self-defined the other side the line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made atheist by suggestion; moral books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exasperating to license; genial books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discounting from the human dignity;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And merry books, which set you weeping when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines, ay, and melancholy books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which make you laugh that any one should weep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this disjointed life for one wrong more.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of books is still the world, I write,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both worlds have God's providence, thank God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep and hearten: with some struggle, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the breakers, some hard swimming through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deeps I lost breath in my soul sometimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cried "God save me if there's any God,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, even so, God saved me; and, being dashed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From error on to error, every turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still brought me nearer to the central truth.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought so. All this anguish in the thick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of men's opinions . . . press and counterpress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now up, now down, now underfoot, and now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergent . . . all the best of it, perhaps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But throws you back upon a noble trust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And use of your own instinct, merely proves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure reason stronger than bare inference
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At strongest. Try it, fix against heaven's wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scaling-ladders of school logic mount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step! sight goes faster; that still ray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which strikes out from you, how, you cannot tell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why, you know not (did you eliminate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such as you indeed should analyse?)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes straight and fast as light, and high as God.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cygnet finds the water, but the man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is born in ignorance of his element
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feels out blind at first, disorganised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sin i' the blood, his spirit-insight dulled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crossed by his sensations. Presently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels it quicken in the dark sometimes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, mark, be reverent, be obedient,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such dumb motions of imperfect life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are oracles of vital Deity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attesting the Hereafter. Let who says
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul's a clean white paper," rather say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A palimpsest, a prophet's holograph
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defiled, erased and covered by a monk's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apocalypse, by a Longus! poring on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which obscene text, we may discern perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fair, fine trace of what was written once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some upstroke of an alpha and omega
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressing the old scripture.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Books, books, books!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had found the secret of a garret-room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piled high with cases in my father's name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piled high, packed large, where, creeping in and out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the giant fossils of my past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some small nimble mouse between the ribs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a mastodon, I nibbled here and there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this or that box, pulling through the gap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In heats of terror, haste, victorious joy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first book first. And how I felt it beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under my pillow, in the morning's dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour before the sun would let me read!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My books! At last because the time was ripe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chanced upon the poets.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunges in fury, when the internal fires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have reached and pricked her heart, and, throwing flat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marts and temples, the triumphal gates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And towers of observation, clears herself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To elemental freedom thus, my soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At poetry's divine first finger-touch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let go conventions and sprang up surprised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convicted of the great eternities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before two worlds.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's this, Aurora Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You write so of the poets, and not laugh?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those virtuous liars, dreamers after dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exaggerators of the sun and moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soothsayers in a tea-cup?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I write so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the only truth-tellers now left to God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only speakers of essential truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposed to relative, comparative,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And temporal truths; the only holders by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sun-skirts, through conventional gray glooms;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only teachers who instruct mankind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From just a shadow on a charnel-wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find man's veritable stature out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erect, sublime, the measure of a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's the measure of an angel, says
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apostle. Ay, and while your common men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay telegraphs, gauge railroads, reign, reap, dine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dust the flaunty carpets of the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For kings to walk on, or our president,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet suddenly will catch them up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his voice like a thunder, "This is soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is life, this word is being said in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's God down on us! what are you about?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How all those workers start amid their work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look round, look up, and feel, a moment's space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That carpet-dusting, though a pretty trade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not the imperative labour after all.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own best poets, am I one with you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thus I love you, or but one through love?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does all this smell of thyme about my feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclude my visit to your holy hill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In personal presence, or but testify
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rustling of your vesture through my dreams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With influent odours? When my joy and pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thought and aspiration, like the stops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pipe or flute, are absolutely dumb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless melodious, do you play on me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pipers, and if, sooth, you did not blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would no sound come? or is the music mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a man's voice or breath is called his own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inbreathed by the Life-breather? There's a doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For cloudy seasons!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sun was high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first I felt my pulses set themselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For concord; when the rhythmic turbulence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of blood and brain swept outward upon words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wind upon the alders, blanching them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By turning up their under-natures till
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They trembled in dilation. O delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And triumph of the poet, who would say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man's mere "yes," a woman's common "no,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little human hope of that or this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And says the word so that it burns you through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a special revelation, shakes the heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the men and women in the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if one came back from the dead and spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes too happy, a familiar thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become divine i' the utterance! while for him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet, speaker, he expands with joy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palpitating angel in his flesh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrills inly with consenting fellowship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those innumerous spirits who sun themselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O life, O poetry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means life in life! cognisant of life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond this blood-beat, passionate for truth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond these senses! poetry, my life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eagle, with both grappling feet still hot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Zeus's thunder, who hast ravished me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from all the shepherds, sheep, and dogs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set me in the Olympian roar and round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of luminous faces for a cup-bearer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the mouths of all the godheads moist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For everlasting laughters, I myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half drunk across the beaker with their eyes!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How those gods look!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough so, Ganymede,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not bear above a round or two.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We drop the golden cup at Heré's foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swoon back to the earth, and find ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face-down among the pine-cones, cold with dew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the dogs bark, and many a shepherd scoffs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's come now to the youth?" Such ups and downs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have poets.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I such indeed? The name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is royal, and to sign it like a queen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is what I dare not, though some royal blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would seem to tingle in me now and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sense of power and ache, with imposthumes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And manias usual to the race. Howbeit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare not: 'tis too easy to go mad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ape a Bourbon in a crown of straws;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing's too common.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many fervent souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike rhyme on rhyme, who would strike steel on steel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If steel had offered, in a restless heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of doing something. Many tender souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have strung their losses on a rhyming thread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As children cowslips: the more pains they take,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work more withers. Young men, ay, and maids,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too often sow their wild oats in tame verse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they sit down under their own vine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And live for use. Alas, near all the birds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will sing at dawn, and yet we do not take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaffering swallow for the holy lark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days, though, I never analysed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even myself. Analysis comes late.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You catch a sight of Nature, earliest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In full front sun-face, and your eyelids wink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drop before the wonder of't; you miss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form, through seeing the light. I lived, those days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrote because I lived unlicensed else;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart beat in my brain. Life's violent flood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abolished bounds, and, which my neighbour's field,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which mine, what mattered? it is thus in youth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We play at leap-frog over the god Term;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love within us and the love without
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We scarce distinguish: thus, with other power;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being acted on and acting seem the same:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that first onrush of life's chariot-wheels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know not if the forests move or we.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, like most young poets, in a flush
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of individual life I poured myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the veins of others, and achieved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere lifeless imitations of live verse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made the living answer for the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profaning nature. "Touch not, do not taste,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor handle," we're too legal, who write young:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if still ignorant of counterpoint;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We call the Muse, "O Muse, benignant Muse,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if we had seen her purple-braided head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the eyes in it, start between the boughs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As often as a stag's. What make-believe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so much earnest! what effete results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From such white heats! bucolics, where the cows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would scare the writer if they splashed the mud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lashing off the flies, didactics, driven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the heels of what the master said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A babe might blow between two straining cheeks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And elegiac griefs, and songs of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worse for being warm: all these things, writ
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On happy mornings, with a morning heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaps for love, is active for resolve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak for art only. Oft, the ancient forms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine-skins, now and then, a little warped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will crack even, as the new wine gurgles in.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spare the old bottles! spill not the new wine.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Keats's soul, the man who never stepped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gradual progress like another man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, turning grandly on his central self,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensphered himself in twenty perfect years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And died, not young (the life of a long life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distilled to a mere drop, falling like a tear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the world's cold cheek to make it burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever); by that strong excepted soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I count it strange and hard to understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nearly all young poets should write old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Pope was sexagenary at sixteen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beardless Byron academical,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so with others. It may be perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such have not settled long and deep enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trance, to attain to clairvoyance, and still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory mixes with the vision, spoils,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And works it turbid.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perhaps, again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to discover the Muse-Sphinx,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melancholy desert must sweep round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind you as before.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I wrote
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False poems, like the rest, and thought them true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because myself was true in writing them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I peradventure have writ true ones since
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With less complacence.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I could not hide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My quickening inner life from those at watch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw a light at a window, now and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had not set there: who had set it there?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father's sister started when she caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul agaze in my eyes. She could not say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no business with a sort of soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But plainly she objected, and demurred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That souls were dangerous things to carry straight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the spilt saltpetre of the world.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said sometimes "Aurora, have you done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your task this morning? have you read that book?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are you ready for the crochet here?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she said "I know there's something wrong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I have not ground you down enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For household uses and proprieties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the rain has got into my barn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set the grains a-sprouting. What, you're green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With out-door impudence? you almost grow?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which I answered, "Would she hear my task,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And verify my abstract of the book?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or should I sit down to the crochet work?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was such her pleasure?" Then I sat and teased
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient needle till it spilt the thread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which oozed off from it in meandering lace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hour to hour. I was not, therefore, sad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul was singing at a work apart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the wall of sense, as safe from harm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sings the lark when sucked up out of sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vortices of glory and blue air.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, through forced work and spontaneous work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner life informed the outer life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced the irregular blood to a settled rhythm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, rounding to the spheric soul the thin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pined body, struck a colour up the cheeks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though somewhat faint. I clenched my brows across
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said "We'll live, Aurora! we'll be strong.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dogs are on us but we will not die."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever lives true life will love true love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt to love that England. Very oft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the day was born, or otherwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through secret windings of the afternoons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I threw my hunters off and plunged myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the deep hills, as a hunted stag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will take the waters, shivering with the fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passion of the course. And when at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escaped, so many a green slope built on slope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt me and the enemy's house behind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dared to rest, or wander, in a rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made sweeter for the step upon the grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And view the ground's most gentle dimplement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As if God's finger touched but did not press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making England), such an up and down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of verdure, nothing too much up or down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ripple of land; such little hills, the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can stoop to tenderly and the wheatfields climb;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such nooks of valleys lined with orchises,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fed full of noises by invisible streams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And open pastures where you scarcely tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White daisies from white dew, at intervals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mythic oaks and elm-trees standing out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-poised upon their prodigy of shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought my father's land was worthy too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of being my Shakespeare's.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very oft alone,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlicensed; not unfrequently with leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To walk the third with Romney and his friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising painter, Vincent Carrington,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom men judge hardly as bee-bonneted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he holds that, paint a body well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You paint a soul by implication, like
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand first Master. Pleasant walks! for if
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said "When I was last in Italy,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounded as an instrument that's played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too far off for the tune and yet it's fine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To listen.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofter we walked only two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If cousin Romney pleased to walk with me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We read, or talked, or quarrelled, as it chanced.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were not lovers, nor even friends well-matched:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say rather, scholars upon different tracks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinkers disagreed: he, overfull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what is, and I, haply, overbold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what might be.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the thrushes sang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook my pulses and the elms' new leaves:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which I turned, and held my finger up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade him mark that, howsoe'er the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went ill, as he related, certainly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrushes still sang in it. At the word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brow would soften, and he bore with me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In melancholy patience, not unkind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While breaking into voluble ecstasy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I flattered all the beauteous country round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As poets use, the skies, the clouds, the fields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy violets hiding from the roads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primroses run down to, carrying gold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tangled hedgerows, where the cows push out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impatient horns and tolerant churning mouths
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt dripping ash-boughs, hedgerows all alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With birds and gnats and large white butterflies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which look as if the May-flower had caught life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And palpitated forth upon the wind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills, vales, woods, netted in a silver mist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farms, granges, doubled up among the hills;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cattle grazing in the watered vales,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cottage-chimneys smoking from the woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cottage-gardens smelling everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confused with smell of orchards. "See," I said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And see! is God not with us on the earth?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shall we put Him down by aught we do?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who says there's nothing for the poor and vile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save poverty and wickedness? behold!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ankle-deep in English grass I leaped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clapped my hands, and called all very fair.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning when God called all good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then was evil near us, it is writ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we indeed who call things good and fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil is upon us while we speak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliver us from evil, let us pray.

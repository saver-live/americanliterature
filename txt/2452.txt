<p>George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends, or "Friends of the Truth," was born at Drayton, Leicestershire, in July, 1624, and died in London on January 13, 1691. His "Journal," here epitomised, was published in 1694, after being revised by a committee under the superintendence of William Penn, and prefaced for the press by Thomas Ellwood, the Quaker. Fox rejected all outward shows of religion, and believed in an inward light and leading. He claimed to be divinely directed as he wandered, Bible in hand, through the country, denouncing church-worship, a paid ministry, religious "profession," and advocating a spiritual affiliation with Christ as the only true religion. He was imprisoned often and long for "brawling" in churches and refusing to take oaths then required by law. Fox wrote in prison many books of religious exhortation, his style being tantalisingly involved. The one work that lives is the "Journal," a quaintly egotistic record of unquestioning faith and unconquerable endurance in pursuit of a spiritual ideal through a rude age.</p><p> </p><p><a href="i-his-youth-and-divine-calling">I.--His Youth and Divine Calling</a></p><p><a href="ii-preaching-and-persecution">II.--Preaching and Persecution</a></p><p><a href="iii-in-perils-oft">III.--In Perils Oft</a></p><p><a href="iv-a-willing-sufferer">IV.--A Willing Sufferer</a></p><p><a href="v-encounters-with-cromwell">V.--Encounters with Cromwell</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/george-fox">George Fox</a> library. </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When smoke stood up from Ludlow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mist blew off from Teme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blithe afield to ploughing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the morning beam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strode beside my team,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blackbird in the coppice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked out to see me stride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hearkened as I whistled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tramping team beside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fluted and replied:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What use to rise and rise?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise man a thousand mornings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet down at last he lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the man is wise."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the tune he sang me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spied his yellow bill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I picked a stone and aimed it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threw it with a will:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the bird was still.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my soul within me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took up the blackbird's strain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still beside the horses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the dewy lane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It Sang the song again:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun moves always west;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road one treads to labour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will lead one home to rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that will be the best."

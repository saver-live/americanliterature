<p>I came to the poet as a guest.<br> Exactly at noon. On Sunday.<br> Beyond the window, frost,<br> Quiet in the room's space.<br> <br> And a raspberry tinted sun<br> Above tangles of blue smokeâ€¦<br> How clearly the taciturn<br> Master turns, on me, his look!<br> <br> His eyes are of that kind<br> Remembered by one and all:<br> Better take care, mind:<br> Don't gaze at them at all.<br> <br> But I remember our words,<br> Smoky noon, of a Sunday,<br> In that high grey house<br> By the Neva's sea-way.<br></p>

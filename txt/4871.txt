<pre>Before

Twas not while England's sword unsheathed
Put half a world to flight,
Nor while their new-built cities breathed
Secure behind her might;
Not while she poured from Pole to Line
Treasure and ships and men
These worshipers at Freedoms shrine
They did not quit her then!

Not till their foes were driven forth
By England o'er the main
Not till the Frenchman from the North
Had gone with shattered Spain;
Not till the clean-swept oceans showed
No hostile flag unrolled,
Did they remember that they owed
To Freedom, and were bold!


After


The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;snow lies thick on Valley Forge,
The ice on the Delaware,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But the poor dead soldiers of King George
They neither know nor care.

Not though the earliest primrose break
On the sunny side of the lane,
And scuffling rookeries awake
Their England' s spring again.

They will not stir when the drifts are gone,
Or the ice melts out of the bay:
And the men that served with Washington
Lie all as still as they.

They will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stir&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mayflower blows
In the moist dark woods of pine,
And every rock-strewn pasture shows
Mullein and columbine.

Each for his land, in a fair fight,
Encountered strove, and died,
And the kindly earth that knows no spite 
Covers them side by side.

She is too busy to think of war;
She has all the world to make gay;
And,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, the yearly flowers are
Where they were in our fathers' day!

Golden-rod by the pasture-wall 
When the columbine is dead,
And sumach leaves that turn, in fall,
Bright as the blood they shed.

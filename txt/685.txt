<p>In the land of Wu the mulberry leaves are green,<br> And thrice the silkworms have gone to sleep.<br> In East Luh where my family stay,<br> I wonder who is sowing those fields of ours.<br> I cannot be back in time for the spring doings,<br> Yet I can help nothing, traveling on the river.<br> The south wind blowing wafts my homesick spirit<br> And carries it up to the front of our familiar tavern.<br> There I see a peach tree on the east side of the house<br> With thick leaves and branches waving in the blue mist.<br> It is the tree I planted before my parting three years ago.<br> The peach tree has grown now as tall as the tavern roof,<br> While I have wandered about without returning.<br> Ping-yang, my pretty daughter, I see you stand<br> By the peach tree and pluck a flowering branch.<br> You pluck the flowers, but I am not there<br> How your tears flow like a stream of water!<br> My little son, Po-chin, grown up to your sister's shoulders,<br> You come out with her under the peach tree,<br> But who is there to pat you on the back?<br> When I think of these things, my senses fail,<br> And a sharp pain cuts my heart every day.<br> Now I tear off a piece of white silk to write this letter,<br> And send it to you with my love a long way up the river. <br></p>

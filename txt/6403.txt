The labor of an age in piled stones?
Or that his hallowed reliques should be hid
Under a star-y pointing pyramid?
Dear son of memory, great heir of fame, 
What needâ€™st thou such weak witness of thy name?
Thou in our wonder and astonishment
Hast built thyself a livelong monument.
For whilst, to the shame of slow-endeavoring art
Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart 
Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book
Those Delphic lines with deep impression took,
Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving,
Dost make us marble with too much conceiving,
And so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie 
That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.

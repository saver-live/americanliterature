<p>I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better<br> Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,<br> He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,<br> Just on spec, addressed as follows, “Clancy, of The Overflow”.<br> <br></p>
<p>And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,<br> (And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)<br> ’Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and <i>verbatim</i> I will quote it:<br> “Clancy’s gone to Queensland droving, and we don’t know where he are.”<br> <br></p>
<p>In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy<br> Gone a-droving “down the Cooper” where the Western drovers go;<br> As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,<br> For the drover’s life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.<br> <br></p>
<p>And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him<br> In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,<br> And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,<br> And at night the wond’rous glory of the everlasting stars.<br> <br></p>
<p>I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy<br> Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,<br> And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city<br> Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all.<br> <br></p>
<p>And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle<br> Of the tramways and the buses making hurry down the street,<br> And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,<br> Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.<br> <br></p>
<p>And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me<br> As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,<br> With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,<br> For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.<br> <br></p>
<p>And I somehow rather fancy that I’d like to change with Clancy,<br> Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,<br> While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal—<br> But I doubt he’d suit the office, Clancy, of The Overflow.</p>

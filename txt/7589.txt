<p> Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running stream.<br> In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of the village where I live.<br> I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and know who I am.<br> I load my little boats with shiuli flowers from our garden, and hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land in the night.<br> I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the little clouds setting their white bulging sails.<br> I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down the air to race with my boats!<br> When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.<br> The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading is their baskets full of dreams.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you ask me, whence these stories?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence these legends and traditions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the odors of the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dew and damp of meadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the curling smoke of wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rushing of great rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their frequent repetitions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their wild reverberations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of thunder in the mountains?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should answer, I should tell you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the forests and the prairies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the great lakes of the Northland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Ojibways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mountains, moors, and fen-lands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeds among the reeds and rushes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat them as I heard them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lips of Nawadaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musician, the sweet singer."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you ask where Nawadaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found these songs so wild and wayward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found these legends and traditions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should answer, I should tell you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the bird's-nests of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lodges of the beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hoof-prints of the bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyry of the eagle!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the wild-fowl sang them to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moorlands and the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the melancholy marshes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chetowaik, the plover, sang them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahng, the loon, the wild-goose, Wawa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grouse, the Mushkodasa!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If still further you should ask me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Who was Nawadaha?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us of this Nawadaha,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should answer your inquiries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway in such words as follow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the vale of Tawasentha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the green and silent valley,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the pleasant water-courses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelt the singer Nawadaha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about the Indian village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the meadows and the corn-fields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beyond them stood the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the groves of singing pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green in Summer, white in Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever sighing, ever singing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the pleasant water-courses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could trace them through the valley,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the rushing in the Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the alders in the Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the white fog in the Autumn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the black line in the Winter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beside them dwelt the singer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vale of Tawasentha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the green and silent valley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There he sang of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the Song of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his wondrous birth and being,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he prayed and how he fasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he lived, and toiled, and suffered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the tribes of men might prosper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he might advance his people!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who love the haunts of Nature,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love the sunshine of the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love the shadow of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love the wind among the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rain-shower and the snow-storm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rushing of great rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through their palisades of pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thunder in the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose innumerable echoes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flap like eagles in their eyries;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to these wild traditions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this Song of Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who love a nation's legends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love the ballads of a people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like voices from afar off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call to us to pause and listen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak in tones so plain and childlike,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely can the ear distinguish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they are sung or spoken;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to this Indian Legend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this Song of Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have faith in God and Nature,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who believe that in all ages
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every human heart is human,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in even savage bosoms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are longings, yearnings, strivings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the good they comprehend not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feeble hands and helpless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groping blindly in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch God's right hand in that darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are lifted up and strengthened;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to this simple story,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this Song of Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye, who sometimes, in your rambles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the green lanes of the country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the tangled barberry-bushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang their tufts of crimson berries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over stone walls gray with mosses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause by some neglected graveyard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while to muse, and ponder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a half-effaced inscription,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written with little skill of song-craft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homely phrases, but each letter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of hope and yet of heart-break,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of all the tender pathos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Here and the Hereafter;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay and read this rude inscription,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read this Song of Hiawatha!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked beside the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day which perished silently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its own glory, like the Princess weird
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, combating the Genius, scorched and seared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttered with burning breath, "Ho! victory!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sank adown, an heap of ashes pale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So runs the Arab tale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky above us showed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An universal and unmoving cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which, the cliffs permitted us to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the outline of their majesty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As master-minds, when gazed at by the crowd!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, shining with a gloom, the water grey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swang in its moon-taught way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor moon nor stars were out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not dare to tread so soon about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though trembling, in the footsteps of the sun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light was neither night's nor day's, but one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, life-like, had a beauty in its doubt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Silence's impassioned breathings round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed wandering into sound.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O solemn-beating heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nature! I have knowledge that thou art
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound unto man's by cords he cannot sever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what time they are slackened by him ever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to attest his own supernal part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still runneth thy vibration fast and strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slackened cord along.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For though we never spoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the grey water anal the shaded rock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark wave and stone, unconsciously, were fused


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the plaintive speaking that we used,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of absent friends and memories unforsook;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, had we seen each other's face, we had
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen haply, each was sad.

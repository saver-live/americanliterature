<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times followed one another. Came a morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood upon the brink of twenty years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked before and after, as I stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman and artist, either incomplete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both credulous of completion. There I held
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole creation in my little cup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled with thirsty lips before I drank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good health to you and me, sweet neighbour mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all these peoples."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was glad, that day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The June was in me, with its multitudes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nightingales all singing in the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rosebuds reddening where the calyx split.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt so young, so strong, so sure of God!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So glad, I could not choose be very wise!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, old at twenty, was inclined to pull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My childhood backward in a childish jest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the face of 't once more, and farewell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which fantastic mood I bounded forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At early morning, would not wait so long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As even to snatch my bonnet by the strings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, brushing a green trail across the lawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my gown in the dew, took will and way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the acacias of the shrubberies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fly my fancies in the open air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep my birthday, till my aunt awoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stop good dreams. Meanwhile I murmured on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As honeyed bees keep humming to themselves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worthiest poets have remained uncrowned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till death has bleached their foreheads to the bone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so with me it must be unless I prove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unworthy of the grand adversity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certainly I would not fail so much.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, therefore, if I crown myself to-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sport, not pride, to learn the feel of it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my brows be numbed as Dante's own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the tender pricking of such leaves?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leaves! what leaves?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled the branches down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To choose from.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the bay! I choose no bay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The fates deny us if we are overbold),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor myrtle which means chiefly love; and love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is something awful which one dares not touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So early o' mornings. This verbena strains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of passionate fragrance; and hard by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guelder-rose, at far too slight a beck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wind, will toss about her flower-apples.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah there's my choice, that ivy on the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That headlong ivy! not a leaf will grow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thinking of a wreath. Large leaves, smooth leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serrated like my vines, and half as green.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like such ivy, bold to leap a height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas strong to climb; as good to grow on graves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As twist about a thyrsus; pretty too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And that's not ill) when twisted round a comb."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus speaking to myself, half singing it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because some thoughts are fashioned like a bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ring with once being touched, I drew a wreath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drenched, blinding me with dew, across my brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fastening it behind so, turning faced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . My public! cousin Romney with a mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice graver than his eyes.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood there fixed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My arms up, like the caryatid, sole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some abolished temple, helplessly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persistent in a gesture which derides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A former purpose. Yet my blush was flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if from flax, not stone.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest of Auroras!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand stretched out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I clasped, as shipwrecked men will clasp a hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indifferent to the sort of palm. The tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had caught me at my pastime, writing down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My foolish name too near upon the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which drowned me with a blush as foolish. "You,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile died out in his eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropped upon his lips, a cold dead weight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For just a moment, "Here's a book I found!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No name writ on it poems, by the form;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Greek upon the margin, lady's Greek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the accents. Read it? Not a word.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw at once the thing had witchcraft in't,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereof the reading calls up dangerous spirits:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rather bring it to the witch."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My book.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You found it" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the hollow by the stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That beech leans down into of which you said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oread in it has a Naiad's heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pines for waters."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks to you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin! that I have seen you not too much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witch, scholar, poet, dreamer, and the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a woman also."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a glance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile rose in his eyes again and touched
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ivy on my forehead, light as air.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered gravely "Poets needs must be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or men or women more's the pity."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But men, and still less women, happily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce need be poets. Keep to the green wreath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since even dreaming of the stone and bronze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings headaches, pretty cousin, and defiles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clean white morning dresses."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you judge!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I love the beautiful I must
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love pleasure chiefly, and be overcharged
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ease and whiteness! well, you know the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only miss your cousin, 'tis not much.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But learn this; I would rather take my part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With God's Dead, who afford to walk in white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet spread His glory, than keep quiet here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gather up my feet from even a step
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear to soil my gown in so much dust.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I choose to walk at all risks. Here, if heads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hold a rhythmic thought, much ache perforce,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part I choose headaches, and today's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My birthday."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Aurora, choose instead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cure them. You have balsams."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I perceive.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headache is too noble for my sex.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think the heartache would sound decenter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that's the woman's special, proper ache,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And altogether tolerable, except
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a woman."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying which, I loosed my wreath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swinging it beside me as I walked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-petulant, half-playful, as we walked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent a sidelong look to find his thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As falcon set on falconer's finger may,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sidelong head, and startled, braving eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means, "You'll see you'll see! I'll soon take flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not hinder." He, as shaking out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand and answering "Fly then," did not speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except by such a gesture. Silently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We paced, until, just coming into sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the house-windows, he abruptly caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one end of the swinging wreath, and said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora!" There I stopped short, breath and all.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora, let's be serious, and throw by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game of head and heart. Life means, be sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both heart and head, both active, both complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both in earnest. Men and women make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world, as head and heart make human life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work man, work woman, since there's work to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this beleaguered earth, for head and heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought can never do the work of love:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But work for ends, I mean for uses, not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such sleek fringes (do you call them ends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still less God's glory?) as we sew ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the velvet of those baldaquins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held 'twixt us and the sun. That book of yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not read a page of; but I toss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rose up it falls calyx down, you see!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chances are that, being a woman, young
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pure, with such a pair of large, calm eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You write as well . . . and ill . . . upon the whole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As other women. If as well, what then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If even a little better, . . . still, what then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want the Best in art now, or no art.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is done for facile settings up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of minnow gods, nymphs here and tritons there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The polytheists have gone out in God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That unity of Bests. No best, no God!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so with art, we say. Give art's divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct, indubitable, real as grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or leave us to the grief we grow ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine by overcoming with mere hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most prosaic patience. You, you are young
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Eve with nature's daybreak on her face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this same world you are come to, dearest coz,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has done with keeping birthdays, saves her wreaths
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hang upon her ruins, and forgets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rhyme the cry with which she still beats back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those savage, hungry dogs that hunt her down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the empty grave of Christ. The world's hard pressed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweat of labour in the early curse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has (turning acrid in six thousand years)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become the sweat of torture. Who has time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour's time . . . think! to sit upon a bank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the cymbal tinkle in white hands?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Egypt's slain, I say, let Miriam sing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before where's Moses?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, exactly that.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where's Moses? is a Moses to be found?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll seek him vainly in the bulrushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I in vain touch cymbals. Yet concede,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such sounding brass has done some actual good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The application in a woman's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that were credible, being scarcely spoilt,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In colonising beehives."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There it is!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You play beside a death-bed like a child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet measure to yourself a prophet's place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To teach the living. None of all these things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can women understand. You generalise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, nothing, not even grief! Your quick-breathed hearts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sympathetic to the personal pang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close on each separate knife-stroke, yielding up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole life at each wound, incapable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of deepening, widening a large lap of life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold the world-full woe. The human race
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you means, such a child, or such a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You saw one morning waiting in the cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside that gate, perhaps. You gather up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few such cases, and when strong sometimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will write of factories and of slaves, as if
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your father were a negro, and your son
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spinner in the mills. All's yours and you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All, coloured with your blood, or otherwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just nothing to you. Why, I call you hard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To general suffering. Here's the world half-blind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With intellectual light, half-brutalised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With civilisation, having caught the plague
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silks from Tarsus, shrieking east and west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a thousand railroads, mad with pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sin too! . . . does one woman of you all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You who weep easily) grow pale to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tiger shake his cage? does one of you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand still from dancing, stop from stringing pearls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pine and die because of the great sum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of universal anguish? Show me a tear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet as Cordelia's, in eyes bright as yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the world is mad. You cannot count,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you should weep for this account, not you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You weep for what you know. A red-haired child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick in a fever, if you touch him once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though but so little as with a finger-tip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will set you weeping; but a million sick . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could as soon weep for the rule of three
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or compound fractions. Therefore, this same world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncomprehended by you, must remain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninfluenced by you. Women as you are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere women, personal and passionate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You give us doating mothers, and perfect wives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublime Madonnas, and enduring saints!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get no Christ from you, and verily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not get a poet, in my mind."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With which conclusion you conclude" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you, Aurora, with the large live brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And steady eyelids, cannot condescend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To play at art, as children play at swords,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show a pretty spirit, chiefly admired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because true action is impossible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never can be satisfied with praise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which men give women when they judge a book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as mere work but as mere woman's work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressing the comparative respect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means the absolute scorn. "Oh, excellent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What grace, what facile turns, what fluent sweeps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What delicate discernment . . . almost thought!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book does honour to the sex, we hold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Among our female authors we make room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For this fair writer, and congratulate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The country that produces in these times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Such women, competent to . . . spell."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop there,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered, burning through his thread of talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a quick flame of emotion, "You have read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul, if not my book, and argue well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not condescend . . . we will not say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such a kind of praise (a worthless end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is praise of all kinds), but to such a use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of holy art and golden life. I am young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And peradventure weak you tell me so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through being a woman. And, for all the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take thanks for justice. I would rather dance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At fairs on tight-rope, till the babies dropped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their gingerbread for joy, than shift the types
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tolerable verse, intolerable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To men who act and suffer. Better far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursue a frivolous trade by serious means,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than a sublime art frivolously."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose nobler work than either, O moist eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurrying lips and heaving heart! We are young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora, you and I. The world, look round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world, we're come to late, is swollen hard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With perished generations and their sins:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civiliser's spade grinds horribly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dead men's bones, and cannot turn up soil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's otherwise than fetid. All success
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proves partial failure; all advance implies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's left behind; all triumph, something crushed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the chariot-wheels; all government, some wrong:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rich men make the poor, who curse the rich,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who agonise together, rich and poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under and over, in the social spasm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crisis of the ages. Here's an age
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes its own vocation! here we have stepped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the bounds of time! here's nought to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just the rich man and just Lazarus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both in torments, with a mediate gulf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not a hint of Abraham's bosom. Who
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being man, Aurora, can stand calmly by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And view these things, and never tease his soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some great cure? No physic for this grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the earth and heavens too?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You believe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In God, for your part? ay? that He who makes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can make good things from ill things, best from worst,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men plant tulips upon dunghills when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wish them finest?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True. A death-heat is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as life-heat, to be accurate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in all nature is no death at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men account of death, so long as God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands witnessing for life perpetually,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By being just God. That's abstract truth, I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy, or sympathy with God:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I, I sympathise with man, not God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I think I was a man for chiefly this),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I stand beside a dying bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis death to me. Observe, it had not much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consoled the race of mastodons to know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they went to fossil, that anon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their place would quicken with the elephant.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were not elephants but mastodons;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, a man, as men are now and not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men may be hereafter, feel with men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the agonising present."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it so,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "my cousin? is the world so bad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I hear nothing of it through the trees?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was always evil, but so bad?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So bad, Aurora. Dear, my soul is grey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With poring over the long sum of ill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for vice, so much for discontent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the necessities of power,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the connivances of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coherent in statistical despairs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a total of distracted life, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see it down in figures on a page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plain, silent, clear, as God sees through the earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of all the graves, that's terrible
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one who is not God, and cannot right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrong he looks on. May I choose indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But vow away my years, my means, my aims,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the helpers, if there's any help
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a social strait? The common blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That swings along my veins is strong enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw me to this duty."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I spoke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not stood long on the strand of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these salt waters have had scarcely time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To creep so high up as to wet my feet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot judge these tides I shall, perhaps.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman's always younger than a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At equal years, because she is disallowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maturing by the outdoor sun and air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah well, I know you men judge otherwise!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think a woman ripens, as a peach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cheeks chiefly. Pass it to me now;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm young in age, and younger still, I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a woman. But a child may say amen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a bishop's prayer and feel the way it goes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, incapable to loose the knot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of social questions, can approve, applaud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August compassion, Christian thoughts that shoot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the vulgar white of personal aims.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accept my reverence."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he glowed on me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all his face and eyes. "No other help?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he "no more than so?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What help?" I asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You'd scorn my help, as Nature's self, you say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has scorned to put her music in my mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a woman's. Do you now turn round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ask for what a woman cannot give?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For what she only can, I turn and ask,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, catching up my hands in his,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropping on me from his high-eaved brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full weight of his soul, "I ask for love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that, she can; for life in fellowship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through bitter duties that, I know she can;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wifehood will she?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now," I said, "may God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be witness 'twixt us two!" and with the word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meseemed I floated into a sudden light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above his stature, "am I proved too weak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stand alone, yet strong enough to bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leaners on my shoulder? poor to think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet rich enough to sympathise with thought?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incompetent to sing, as blackbirds can,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet competent to love, like him?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paused;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I darkened, as the lighthouse will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That turns upon the sea. "It's always so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything does for a wife."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora, dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dearly honoured," he pressed in at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eager utterance, "you translate me ill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not contradict my thought of you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is most reverent, with another thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found less so. If your sex is weak for art
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And I, who said so, did but honour you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By using truth in courtship), it is strong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For life and duty. Place your fecund heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mine, and let us blossom for the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wants love's colour in the grey of time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My talk, meanwhile, is arid to you, ay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since all my talk can only set you where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look down coldly on the arena-heaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of headless bodies, shapeless, indistinct!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judgment-Angel scarce would find his way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through such a heap of generalised distress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the individual man with lips and eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less Aurora. Ah, my sweet, come down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hand in hand we'll go where yours shall touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These victims, one by one! till, one by one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formless, nameless trunk of every man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall seem to wear a head with hair you know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every woman catch your mother's face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To melt you into passion."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a girl,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered slowly; "you do well to name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother's face. Though far too early, alas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's hand did interpose 'twixt it and me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know so much of love as used to shine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that face and another. Just so much;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more indeed at all. I have not seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much love since, I pray you pardon me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As answers even to make a marriage with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this cold land of England. What you love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not a woman, Romney, but a cause:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want a helpmate, not a mistress, sir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wife to help your ends, in her no end.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your cause is noble, your ends excellent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I, being most unworthy of these and that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do otherwise conceive of love. Farewell."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell, Aurora? you reject me thus?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, you were married long ago.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a wife already whom you love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your social theory. Bless you both, I say.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I am scarcely meek enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be the handmaid of a lawful spouse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I look a Hagar, think you?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you jest."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, so, I speak in earnest," I replied.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You treat of marriage too much like, at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chief apostle: you would bear with you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wife . . . a sister . . . shall we speak it out?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sister of charity."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, must it be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed farewell? And was I so far wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hope and in illusion, when I took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman to be nobler than the man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yourself the noblest woman, in the use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And comprehension of what love is, love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That generates the likeness of itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all heroic duties? so far wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying bluntly, venturing truth on love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Come, human creature, love and work with me,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of 'Lady, thou art wondrous fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And, where the Graces walk before, the Muse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Will follow at the lightning of their eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And where the Muse walks, lovers need to creep:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Turn round and love me, or I die of love.'"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With quiet indignation I broke in.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You misconceive the question like a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sees a woman as the complement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his sex merely. You forget too much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That every creature, female as the male,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands single in responsible act and thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As also in birth and death. Whoever says
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a loyal woman, 'Love and work with me,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will get fair answers if the work and love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being good themselves, are good for her the best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was born for. Women of a softer mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprised by men when scarcely awake to life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will sometimes only hear the first word, love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch up with it any kind of work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indifferent, so that dear love go with it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not blame such women, though, for love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pick much oakum; earth's fanatics make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too frequently heaven's saints. But me your work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not the best for, nor your love the best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor able to commend the kind of work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For love's sake merely. Ah, you force me, sir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be overbold in speaking of myself:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too have my vocation, work to do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavens and earth have set me since I changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father's face for theirs, and, though your world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were twice as wretched as you represent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most serious work, most necessary work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any of the economists'. Reform,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make trade a Christian possibility,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And individual right no general wrong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wipe out earth's furrows of the Thine and Mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave one green for men to play at bowls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With innings for them all! . . . What then, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If mortals are not greater by the head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any of their prosperities? what then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the artist keep up open roads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt the seen and unseen, bursting through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best of your conventions with his best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakable, imaginable best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God bids him speak, to prove what lies beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both speech and imagination? A starved man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceeds a fat beast: we'll not barter, sir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful for barley. And, even so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold you will not compass your poor ends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of barley-feeding and material ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a poet's individualism
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To work your universal. It takes a soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move a body: it takes a high-souled man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move the masses, even to a cleaner stye:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes the ideal, to blow a hair's-breadth off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust of the actual. Ah, your Fouriers failed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because not poets enough to understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That life develops from within. For me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I am not worthy, as you say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of work like this: perhaps a woman's soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspires, and not creates: yet we aspire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I'll try out your perhapses, sir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I fail . . . why, burn me up my straw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other false works I'll not ask for grace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your scorn is better, cousin Romney. I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who love my art, would never wish it lower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suit my stature. I may love my art.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll grant that even a woman may love art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that to waste true love on anything
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is womanly, past question."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I retain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very last word which I said that day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you the creaking of the door, years past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which let upon you such disabling news
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ever after have been graver. He,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes, the motions in his silent mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were fiery points on which my words were caught,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfixed for ever in my memory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his sake, not their own. And yet I know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not love him . . . nor he me . . . that's sure . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what I said is unrepented of,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As truth is always. Yet . . . a princely man!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If hard to me, heroic for himself!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bears down on me through the slanting years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stronger for the distance. If he had loved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, loved me, with that retributive face, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might have been a common woman now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And happier, less known and less left alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a better woman after all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With chubby children hanging on my neck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep me low and wise. Ah me, the vines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bear such fruit are proud to stoop with it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm stands upright in a realm of sand.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, who spoke the truth then, stand upright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still worthy of having spoken out the truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By being content I spoke it though it set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him there, me here. O woman's vile remorse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hanker after a mere name, a show,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A supposition, a potential love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does every man who names love in our lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a power for that? is love's true thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much best to us, that what personates love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is next best? A potential love, forsooth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not so vile. No, no he cleaves, I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man, this image, chiefly for the wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shock he gave my life, in finding me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely where the devil of my youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had set me, on those mountain-peaks of hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All glittering with the dawn-dew, all erect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And famished for the noon, exclaiming, while
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked for empire and much tribute, "Come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some worthy work for thee below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, sweep my barns and keep my hospitals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will pay thee with a current coin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which men give women."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we spoke, the grass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was trod in haste beside us, and my aunt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With smile distorted by the sun, face, voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much at issue with the summer-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if you brought a candle out of doors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke in with "Romney, here! My child, entreat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your cousin to the house, and have your talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If girls must talk upon their birthdays. Come."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered for me calmly, with pale lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seemed to motion for a smile in vain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The talk is ended, madam, where we stand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your brother's daughter has dismissed me here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my answer can be better said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the trees, than wrong by such a word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your house's hospitalities. Farewell."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that he vanished. I could hear his heel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring bluntly in the lane, as down he leapt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short way from us. Then a measured speech
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrew me. "What means this, Aurora Leigh?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother's daughter has dismissed my guests?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion in me felt the keeper's voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all its quivering dewlaps; I was quelled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before her, meekened to the child she knew:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prayed her pardon, said "I had little thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give dismissal to a guest of hers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In letting go a friend of mine who came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take me into service as a wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than that, indeed."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more, no more?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray Heaven," she answered, "that I was not mad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not mean to tell her to her face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Romney Leigh had asked me for a wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I refused him?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did he ask?" I said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think he rather stooped to take me up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For certain uses which he found to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For something called a wife. He never asked."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What stuff!" she answered; "are they queens, these girls?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must have mantles, stitched with twenty silks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread out upon the ground, before they'll step
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One footstep for the noblest lover born."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am born," I said with firmness, "I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To walk another way than his, dear aunt."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You walk, you walk! A babe at thirteen months
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will walk as well as you," she cried in haste,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without a steadying finger. Why, you child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God help you, you are groping in the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all this sunlight. You suppose, perhaps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you, sole offspring of an opulent man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are rich and free to choose a way to walk?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think, and it's a reasonable thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I, beside, being well to do in life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will leave my handful in my niece's hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When death shall paralyse these fingers? Pray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray, child, albeit I know you love me not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if you loved me, that I may not die!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when I die and leave you, out you go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Unless I make room for you in my grave),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhoused, unfed, my dear poor brother's lamb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ah heaven! that pains!) without a right to crop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single blade of grass beneath these trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or cast a lamb's small shadow on the lawn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfed, unfolded! Ah, my brother, here's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fruit you planted in your foreign loves!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, there's the fruit he planted! never look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astonished at me with your mother's eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it was they who set you where you are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An undowered orphan. Child, your father's choice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that said mother disinherited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughter, his and hers. Men do not think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sons and daughters, when they fall in love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much more than of sisters; otherwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would have paused to ponder what he did,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shrunk before that clause in the entail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding offspring by a foreign wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The clause set up a hundred years ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a Leigh who wedded a French dancing-girl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had his heart danced over in return);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this man shrank at nothing, never thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of you, Aurora, any more than me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mother must have been a pretty thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the coarse Italian blacks and browns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a good man, which my brother was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unchary of the duties to his house;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so it fell indeed. Our cousin Vane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vane Leigh, the father of this Romney, wrote
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly on your birth, to Italy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I ask your baby daughter for my son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whom the entail now merges by the law.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betroth her to us out of love, instead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of colder reasons, and she shall not lose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By love or law from henceforth' so he wrote;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A generous cousin was my cousin Vane.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember how he drew you to his knee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year you came here, just before he died,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hollowed out his hands to hold your cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wished them redder, you remember Vane.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now his son, who represents our house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And holds the fiefs and manors in his place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom reverts my pittance when I die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Except a few books and a pair of shawls),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy is generous like him, and prepared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry out his kindest word and thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you, Aurora. Yes, a fine young man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Romney Leigh; although the sun of youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has shone too straight upon his brain, I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fevered him with dreams of doing good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To good-for-nothing people. But a wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will put all right, and stroke his temples cool
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With healthy touches." . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I broke in at that.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not lift my heavy heart to breathe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, then, but then I raised it, and it fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In broken words like these "No need to wait:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream of doing good to . . . me, at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is ended, without waiting for a wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cool the fever for him. We've escaped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That danger, thank Heaven for it."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You," she cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have got a fever. What, I talk and talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour long to you, I instruct you how
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot eat or drink or stand or sit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or even die, like any decent wretch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all this unroofed and unfurnished world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without your cousin, and you still maintain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's room 'twixt him and you for flirting fans
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And running knots in eyebrows? You must have
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pattern lover sighing on his knee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not count enough, a noble heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Above book-patterns) which this very morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unclosed itself in two dear fathers' names
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To embrace your orphaned life? Fie, fie! But stay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I write a word, and counteract this sin."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would have turned to leave me, but I clung.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O sweet my father's sister, hear my word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you write yours. Cousin Vane did well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cousin Romney well, and I well too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In casting back with all my strength and will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good they meant me. O my God, my God!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God meant me good, too, when He hindered me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From saying 'yes' this morning. If you write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word, it shall be 'no.' I say no, no!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tie up 'no' upon His altar-horns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite out of reach of perjury! At least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul is not a pauper; I can live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least my soul's life, without alms from men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if it must be in heaven instead of earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let heaven look to it, I am not afraid."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seized my hands with both hers, strained them fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drew her probing and unscrupulous eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right through me, body and heart. "Yet, foolish Sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You love this man. I've watched you when he came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he went, and when we've talked of him:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not old for nothing; I can tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather-signs of love: you love this man."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls blush sometimes because they are alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half wishing they were dead to save the shame.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden blush devours them, neck and brow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have drawn too near the fire of life, like gnats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flare up bodily, wings and all. What then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who's sorry for a gnat . . . or girl?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blushed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the brand upon my forehead now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike hot, sear deep, as guiltless men may feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The felon's iron, say, and scorn the mark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what they are not. Most illogical
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrational nature of our womanhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blushes one way, feels another way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prays, perhaps, another! After all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot be the equal of the male
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who rules his blood a little.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For although
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blushed indeed, as if I loved the man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her incisive smile, accrediting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That treason of false witness in my blush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did bow me downward like a swathe of grass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below its level that struck me, I attest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conscious skies and all their daily suns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I loved him not, nor then, nor since,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ever. Do we love the schoolmaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being busy in the woods? much less, being poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overseer of the parish? Do we keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our love to pay our debts with?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White and cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew next moment. As my blood recoiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that imputed ignominy, I made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart great with it. Then, at last, I spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoke veritable words but passionate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too passionate perhaps . . . ground up with sobs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shapeless endings. She let fall my hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took her smile off, in sedate disgust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As peradventure she had touched a snake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dead snake, mind! and, turning round, replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We'll leave Italian manners, if you please.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you had an English father, child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ought to find it possible to speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet 'yes' or 'no,' like English girls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without convulsions. In another month
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll take another answer no, or yes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, she left me in the garden-walk.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a father! yes, but long ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long it seemed that moment. Oh, how far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far and safe, God, dost thou keep thy saints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When once gone from us! We may call against
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lighted windows of thy fair June-heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all the souls are happy, and not one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even my father, look from work or play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask, "Who is it that cries after us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below there, in the dusk?" Yet formerly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his face upon me quick enough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I said "father." Now I might cry loud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little lark reached higher with his song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I with crying. Oh, alone, alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not troubling any in heaven, nor any on earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood there in the garden, and looked up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deaf blue sky that brings the roses out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such June mornings.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You who keep account
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of crisis and transition in this life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set down the first time Nature says plain "no"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some "yes" in you, and walks over you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gorgeous sweeps of scorn. We all begin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By singing with the birds, and running fast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With June-days, hand in hand: but once, for all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds must sing against us, and the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike down upon us like a friend's sword caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an enemy to slay us, while we read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dear name on the blade which bites at us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's bitter and convincing: after that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seldom doubt that something in the large
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth order of creation, though no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than haply a man's footstep, has gone wrong.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tears fell down my cheeks, and then I smiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As those smile who have no face in the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To smile back to them. I had lost a friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Romney Leigh; the thing was sure a friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had looked at me most gently now and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spoken of my favourite books, "our books,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a voice! Well, voice and look were now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More utterly shut out from me I felt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than even my father's. Romney now was turned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a benefactor, to a generous man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had tied himself to marry . . . me, instead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such a woman, with low timorous lids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted with a sudden word one day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left, perhaps, for my sake. Ah, self-tied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a contract, male Iphigenia bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a fatal Aulis for the winds to change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(But loose him, they'll not change), he well might seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little cold and dominant in love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a right to be dogmatical,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poor, good Romney. Love, to him, was made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple law-clause. If I married him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should not dare to call my soul my own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which so he had bought and paid for: every thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every heart-beat down there in the bill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one found honestly deductible
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From any use that pleased him! He might cut
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My body into coins to give away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among his other paupers; change my sons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I stood dumb as Griseld, for black babes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or piteous foundlings; might unquestioned set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My right hand teaching in the Ragged Schools,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My left hand washing in the Public Baths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time my angel of the Ideal stretched
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both his to me in vain. I could not claim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor right of a mouse in a trap, to squeal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take so much as pity from myself.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, good Romney! if I loved you even,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could but ill afford to let you be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So generous to me. Farewell, friend, since friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt us two, forsooth, must be a word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So heavily overladen. And, since help
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must come to me from those who love me not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, all helpers I must help myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And am alone from henceforth. Then I stooped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lifted the soiled garland from the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set it on my head as bitterly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the Spanish monarch crowned the bones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his dead love. So be it. I preserve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That crown still, in the drawer there! 'twas the first.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest are like it; those Olympian crowns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We run for, till we lose sight of the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dust of the racing chariots!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the evening fell, I had a note,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ran, "Aurora, sweet Chaldean, you read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My meaning backward like your eastern books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am from the west, dear. Read me now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little plainer. Did you hate me quite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yesterday? I loved you for my part;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love you. If I spoke untenderly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, my beloved, pardon it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And comprehend me that I loved you so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I set you on the level of my soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And overwashed you with the bitter brine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some habitual thoughts. Henceforth, my flower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be planted out of reach of any such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lean the side you please, with all your leaves!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write woman's verses and dream woman's dreams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me feel your perfume in my home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make my sabbath after working-days.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloom out your youth beside me, be my wife."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote in answer "We Chaldeans discern
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still farther than we read. I know your heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shut it like the holy book it is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserved for mild-eyed saints to pore upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt their prayers at vespers. Well, you're right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not surely hate you yesterday;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I do not love you enough to-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wed you, cousin Romney. Take this word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let it stop you as a generous man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From speaking farther. You may tease, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blow about my feelings, or my leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here's my aunt will help you with east winds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And break a stalk, perhaps, tormenting me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But certain flowers grow near as deep as trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, cousin, you'll not move my root, not you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all your confluent storms. Then let me grow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within my wayside hedge, and pass your way!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flower has never as much to say to you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the antique tomb which said to travellers, 'Pause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Siste, viator.'" Ending thus, I sighed.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next week passed in silence, so the next,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And several after: Romney did not come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor my aunt chide me. I lived on and on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if my heart were kept beneath a glass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everybody stood, all eyes and ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see and hear it tick. I could not sit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor walk, nor take a book, nor lay it down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor sew on steadily, nor drop a stitch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a sigh with it, but I felt her looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still cleaving to me, like the sucking asp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Cleopatra's breast, persistently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the intermittent pantings. Being observed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When observation is not sympathy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is just being tortured. If she said a word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "thank you," or an "if it please you, dear,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She meant a commination, or, at best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exorcism against the devildom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which plainly held me. So with all the house.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susannah could not stand and twist my hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without such glancing at the looking-glass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see my face there, that she missed the plait.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And John, I never sent my plate for soup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or did not send it, but the foolish John
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved the problem, 'twixt his napkined thumbs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what was signified by taking soup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or choosing mackerel. Neighbours who drooped in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On morning visits, feeling a joint wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled admonition, sat uneasily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talked, with measured, emphasised reserve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of parish news, like doctors to the sick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When not called in, as if, with leave to speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might say something. Nay, the very dog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would watch me from his sun-patch on the floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In alternation with the large black fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet in reach of snapping. So I lived.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Roman died so; smeared with honey, teased
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By insects, stared to torture by the noon:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many patient souls 'neath English roofs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have died like Romans. I, in looking back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wish only, now, I had borne the plague of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With meeker spirits than were rife at Rome.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, on the sixth week, the dead sea broke up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dashed suddenly through beneath the heel of Him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stands upon the sea and earth and swears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time shall be nevermore. The clock struck nine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That morning too, no lark was out of tune,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden farms among the hills breathed straight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their smoke toward heaven, the lime-tree scarcely stirred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the blue weight of the cloudless sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though still the July air came floating through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woodbine at my window, in and out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With touches of the out-door country news
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a bending forehead. There I sat, and wished
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That morning-truce of God would last till eve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or longer. "Sleep," I thought, "late sleepers, sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spare me yet the burden of your eyes."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, suddenly, a single ghastly shriek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tore upward from the bottom of the house.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one who wakens in a grave and shrieks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The still house seemed to shriek itself alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shudder through its passages and stairs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With slam of doors and clash of bells. I sprang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood up in the middle of the room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there confronted at my chamber-door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white face, shivering, ineffectual lips.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, come," they tried to utter, and I went:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a ghost had drawn me at the point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a fiery finger through the uneven dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went with reeling footsteps down the stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor asked a question.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There she sat, my aunt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolt upright in the chair beside her bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose pillow had no dint! she had used no bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that night's sleeping, yet slept well. My God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dumb derision of that grey, peaked face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concluded something grave against the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which filled the chamber with its July burst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Susan drew the curtains ignorant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of who sat open-eyed behind her. There
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat . . . it sat . . . we said "she" yesterday . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held a letter with unbroken seal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Susan gave it to her hand last night:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night she had held it. If its news referred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To duchies or to dunghills, not an inch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She'd budge, 'twas obvious, for such worthless odds:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, though the stars were suns and overburned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their spheric limitations, swallowing up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like wax the azure spaces, could they force
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those open eyes to wink once. What last sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had left them blank and flat so, drawing out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faculty of vision from the roots,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As nothing more, worth seeing, remained behind?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were those the eyes that watched me, worried me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dogged me up and down the hours and days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beaten, breathless, miserable soul?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did I pray, a half-hour back, but so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To escape the burden of those eyes . . . those eyes?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sleep late" I said?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, now, indeed, they sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gauntlet with a gift in't. Every wish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is like a prayer, with God.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had my wish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To read and meditate the thing I would,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fashion all my life upon my thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And marry or not marry. Henceforth none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could disapprove me, vex me, hamper me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full ground-room, in this desert newly made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Babylon or Baalbec, when the breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now choked with sand, returns for building towns.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heir came over on the funeral day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we two cousins met before the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two pale faces. Was it death or life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That moved us? When the will was read and done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official guests and witnesses withdrawn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rose up in a silence almost hard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked at one another. Then I said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell, my cousin."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he touched, just touched
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hatstrings, tied for going (at the door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stood to take me), and said low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice a little unsteady through his smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siste, viator."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there time," I asked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In these last days of railroads, to stop short
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Cæsar's chariot (weighing half a ton)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Appian road, for morals?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is time,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered grave, "for necessary words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusive, trust me, of no epitaph
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On man or act, my cousin. We have read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A will, which gives you all the personal goods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And funded moneys of your aunt."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her memory for it. With three hundred pounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We buy, in England even, clear standing-room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stand and work in. Only two hours since,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fancied I was poor."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, cousin, still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're richer than you fancy. The will says,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred pounds, and any other sum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which the said testatrix dies possessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say she died possessed of other sums."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Romney, need we chronicle the pence?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm richer than I thought that's evident.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough so."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen rather. You've to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With business and a cousin," he resumed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And both, I fear, need patience. Here's the fact.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other sum (there is another sum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspecified in any will which dates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After possession, yet bequeathed as much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clearly as those said three hundred pounds)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is thirty thousand. You will have it paid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When? . . . where? My duty troubles you with words."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struck the iron when the bar was hot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder if my eyes sent out some sparks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pause there! I thank you. You are delicate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In glosing gifts; but I, who share your blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am rather made for giving, like yourself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than taking, like your pensioners. Farewell."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped me with a gesture of calm pride.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Leigh," he said, "gives largesse and gives love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But gloses never: if a Leigh could glose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would not do it, moreover, to a Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blood trained up along nine centuries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hound and hate a lie from eyes like yours.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we'll make the rest as clear: your aunt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possessed these moneys."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will make it clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin, as the honour of us both,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or one of us speaks vainly! that's not I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My aunt possessed this sum, inherited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From whom, and when? bring documents, prove dates."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why now indeed you throw your bonnet off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if you had time left for a logarithm!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faith's the want. Dear cousin, give me faith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shall walk this road with silken shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As clean as any lady of our house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposed the proudest. Oh, I comprehend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole position from your point of sight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I oust you from your father's halls and lands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make you poor by getting rich that's law;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering which, in common circumstance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would not scruple to accept from me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some compensation, some sufficiency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of income that were justice; but, alas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love you, that's mere nature; you reject
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love, that's nature also; and at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot, from a suitor disallowed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hand thrown back as mine is, into yours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive a doit, a farthing, not for the world!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's woman's etiquette, and obviously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceeds the claim of nature, law, and right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unanswerable to all. I grant, you see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case as you conceive it, leave you room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sweep your ample skirts of womanhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, standing humbly squeezed against the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I own myself excluded from being just,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrained from paying indubitable debts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because denied from giving you my soul.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's my misfortune! I submit to it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if, in some more reasonable age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould not be less inevitable. Enough.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll trust me, cousin, as a gentleman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep your honour, as you count it, pure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your scruples (just as if I thought them wise)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe and inviolate from gifts of mine."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered mild but earnest. "I believe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no one's honour which another keeps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor man's nor woman's. As I keep, myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My truth and my religion, I depute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No father, though I had one this side death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor brother, though I had twenty, much less you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though twice my cousin, and once Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep my honour pure. You face, to-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man who wants instruction, mark me, not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman who wants protection. As to a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show manhood, speak out plainly, be precise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With facts and dates. My aunt inherited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sum, you say "


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said she died possessed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this, dear cousin."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not by heritage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you: we're getting to the facts at last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps she played at commerce with a ship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which came in heavy with Australian gold?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or touched a lottery with her finger-end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which tumbled on a sudden into her lap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some old Rhine tower or principality?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps she had to do with a marine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-transatlantic railroad, which pre-pays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as pre-supposes? or perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some stale ancestral debt was after-paid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a hundred years, and took her by surprise?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shake your head, my cousin; I guess ill."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need not guess, Aurora, nor deride;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is not afraid of hurting you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll find no cause, in all your scruples, why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your aunt should cavil at a deed of gift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt her and me."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought so ah! a gift."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You naturally thought so," he resumed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very natural gift."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A gift, a gift!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her individual life being stranded high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all want, approaching opulence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too haughty was she to accept a gift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without some ultimate aim: ah, ah, I see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gift intended plainly for her heirs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so accepted . . . if accepted . . . ah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed that might be; I am snared perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just so. But, cousin, shall I pardon you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thus you have caught me with a cruel springe?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered gently, "Need you tremble and pant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a netted lioness? is't my fault, mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you're a grand wild creature of the woods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hate the stall built for you? Any way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though triply netted, need you glare at me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not hold the cords of such a net;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're free from me, Aurora!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now may God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliver me from this strait! This gift of yours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was tendered . . . when? accepted . . . when?" I asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A month . . . a fortnight since? Six weeks ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not tendered; by a word she dropped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it was not tendered nor received.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When was it? bring your dates."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What matters when?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-hour ere she died, or a half-year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secured the gift, maintains the heritage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inviolable with law. As easy pluck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden stars from heaven's embroidered stole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pin them on the grey side of this earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As make you poor again, thank God."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Net poor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor clean again from henceforth, you thank God?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, sir I ask you I insist at need,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vouchsafe the special date, the special date."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The day before her death-day," he replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gift was in her hands. We'll find that deed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certify that date to you."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has climbed a mountain-height and carried up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own heart climbing, panting in his throat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the toil of the ascent, takes breath at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks back in triumph so I stood and looked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear cousin Romney, we have reached the top
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this steep question, and may rest, I think.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, I pray you pardon, that the shock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And surge of natural feeling and event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has made me oblivious of acquainting you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this, this letter (unread, mark, still sealed),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was found enfolded in the poor dead hand:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That spirit of hers had gone beyond the address,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which could not find her though you wrote it clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know your writing, Romney, recognise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open-hearted A, the liberal sweep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the G. Now listen, let us understand:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not find that famous deed of gift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you find it in the letter here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, not being mine, I give you back. Refuse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the letter? well then you and I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As writer and as heiress, open it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, by your leave. Exactly so:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words in which the noble offering's made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are nobler still, my cousin; and, I own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proudest and most delicate heart alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distracted from the measure of the gift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By such a grace in giving, might accept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your largesse without thinking any more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the burthen of it, than King Solomon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considered, when he wore his holy ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charactered over with the ineffable spell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many carats of fine gold made up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its money-value: so, Leigh gives to Leigh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rather, might have given, observe, for that's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point we come to. Here's a proof of gift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here's no proof, sir, of acceptancy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, rather, disproof. Death's black dust, being blown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infiltrated through every secret fold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this sealed letter by a puff of fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dried up for ever the fresh-written ink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annulled the gift, disutilised the grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left these fragments."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I spoke, I tore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper up and down, and down and up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crosswise, till it fluttered from my hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As forest-leaves, stripped suddenly and rapt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a whirlwind on Valdarno, drop again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drop slow, and strew the melancholy ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the amazèd hills . . . why, so, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing like a poet, somewhat large
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the type of the image, and exaggerate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small thing with a great thing, topping it:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then I'm thinking how his eyes looked, his,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what despondent and surprised reproach!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the tears were in them as he looked;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the manly mouth just trembled. Then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke the silence.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may ask, perhaps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no stranger . . . only Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means still less . . . than Vincent Carrington,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your plans in going hence, and where you go.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be a secret."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All my life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is open to you, cousin. I go hence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To London, to the gathering-place of souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live mine straight out, vocally, in books;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmoniously for others, if indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman's soul, like man's, be wide enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry the whole octave (that's to prove),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if I fail, still purely for myself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray God be with me, Romney."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, poor child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fight against the mother's 'tiring hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And choose the headsman's! May God change His world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your sake, sweet, and make it mild as heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And juster than I have found you."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I paused.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you, my cousin?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I," he said, "you ask?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You care to ask? Well, girls have curious minds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fain would know the end of everything,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cousins therefore with the rest. For me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora, I've my work; you know my work;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, having missed this year some personal hope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must beware the rather that I miss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reasonable duty. While you sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your happy pastorals of the meads and trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethink you that I go to impress and prove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On stifled brains and deafened ears, stunned deaf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crushed dull with grief, that nature sings itself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And needs no mediate poet, lute or voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it vocal. While you ask of men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your audience, I may get their leave perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hungry orphans to say audibly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We're hungry, see,' for beaten and bullied wives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold their unweaned babies up in sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom orphanage would better, and for all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak and claim their portion . . . by no means
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the soil, . . . but of the sweat in tilling it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this is nowadays turned privilege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have only God's curse on us, and not man's.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such work I have for doing, elbow-deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In social problems, as you tie your rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw my uses to cohere with needs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring the uneven world back to its round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, failing so much, fill up, bridge at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To smoother issues some abysmal cracks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feuds of earth, intestine heats have made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep men separate, using sorry shifts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hospitals, almshouses, infant schools,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other practical stuff of partial good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You lovers of the beautiful and whole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despise by system."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I despise? The scorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is yours, my cousin. Poets become such
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through scorning nothing. You decry them for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good of beauty sung and taught by them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they respect your practical partial good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As being a part of beauty's self. Adieu!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When God helps all the workers for His world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singers shall have help of Him, not last."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled as men smile when they will not speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of something bitter in the thought;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still I feel his melancholy eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look judgment on me. It is seven years since:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not if 'twas pity or 'twas scorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has made them so far-reaching: judge it ye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have had to do with pity more than love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scorn than hatred. I am used, since then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To other ways, from equal men. But so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, we let go hands, my cousin and I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in between us rushed the torrent-world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To blanch our faces like divided rocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bar for ever mutual sight and touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except through swirl of spray and all that roar.

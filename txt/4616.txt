<pre>"The Manner of Men" - St. Paul
"Limits and Renewals" (1932)

I am made all things to all men,
Hebrew, Roman, and Greek,
In each one's tongue I speal,
Suiting to each my word,
That some may be drawn to the Lord!

I am made all things to all men,
In City or Wilderness
Praising the crafts they profess
That some may be drawn to the Lord,
By any means to my Lord!

Since I was overcome
By that great Light and Word,
I have forgot or forgone
The self men call their own
(Being made all things to all men)
So that I might save some
At such small price, to the Lord,
As being all things to all men.

I was made all things to all men,
But now my course is done,
And now is my reward...
Ah, Christ, when I stand at Thy Throne
With those I have drawn to the Lord,
Restore me my self again!

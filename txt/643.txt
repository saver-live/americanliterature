<p>The seafarers tell of the Eastern Isle of Bliss,<br> It is lost in a wilderness of misty sea waves.<br> But the Sky-land of the south, the Yueh-landers say,<br> May be seen through cracks of the glimmering cloud.<br> This land of the sky stretches across the leagues of heaven;<br> It rises above the Five Mountains and towers over the Scarlet Castle,<br> <br> While, as if staggering before it, the Tien-tai Peak<br> Of forty-eight thousand feet leans toward the southeast.<br> <br> So, longing to dream of the southlands of Wu and Yueh,<br> I flew across the Mirror Lake one night under the moon.<br> <br> The moon in the lake followed my flight,<br> Followed me to the town of Yen-chi.<br> Here still stands the mansion of Prince Hsieh.<br> I saw the green waters curl and heard the monkeys' shrill cries.<br> I climbed, putting on the clogs of the prince, <br> Skyward on a ladder of clouds,<br> And half-way up from the sky-wall I saw the morning sun,<br> And heard the heaven's cock crowing in the mid-air.<br> Now among a thousand precipices my way wound round and round;<br> Flowers choked the path; I leaned against a rock; I swooned.<br> <br> Roaring bears and howling dragons roused meâ<br> Oh, the clamorous waters of the rapids!<br> I trembled in the deep forest, and shuddered at the overhanging crags, <br> one heaped upon another.<br> Clouds on clouds gathered above, threatening rain;<br> The waters gushed below, breaking into mist.<br> <br> A peal of blasting thunder!<br> The mountains crumbled.<br> The stone gate of the hollow heaven<br> Opened wide, revealing<br> A vasty realm of azure without bottom,<br> Sun and moon shining together on gold and silver palaces.<br> <br> Clad in rainbow and riding on the wind,<br> The ladies of the air descended like flower, flakes;<br> The faery lords trooping in, they were thick as hemp-stalks in the fields.<br> Phoenix birds circled their cars, and panthers played upon harps.<br> Bewilderment filled me, and terror seized on my heart.<br> I lifted myself in amazement, and alas!<br> I woke and found my bed and pillowâ<br> Gone was the radiant world of gossamer.<br> <br> So with all pleasures of life.<br> All things pass with the east-flowing water.<br> I leave you and goâwhen shall I return?<br> Let the white roe feed at will among the green crags,<br> Let me ride and visit the lovely mountains!<br> How can I stoop obsequiously and serve the mighty ones!<br> It stifles my soul. <br></p>

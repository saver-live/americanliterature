<p>I </p><p>In Petersburg in the eighteen-forties a surprising event occurred. An<br>officer of the Cuirassier Life Guards, a handsome prince who everyone<br>predicted would become aide-de-camp to the Emperor Nicholas I and have<br>a brilliant career, left the service, broke off his engagement to a<br>beautiful maid of honour, a favourite of the Empress's, gave his small<br>estate to his sister, and retired to a monastery to become a monk. </p><p>This event appeared extraordinary and inexplicable to those who did not<br>know his inner motives, but for Prince Stepan Kasatsky himself it all<br>occurred so naturally that he could not imagine how he could have acted<br>otherwise. </p><p>His father, a retired colonel of the Guards, had died when Stepan was<br>twelve, and sorry as his mother was to part from her son, she entered<br>him at the Military College as her deceased husband had intended. </p><p>The widow herself, with her daughter, Varvara, moved to Petersburg to be<br>near her son and have him with her for the holidays. </p><p>The boy was distinguished both by his brilliant ability and by his<br>immense self-esteem. He was first both in his studies--especially in<br>mathematics, of which he was particularly fond--and also in drill and in<br>riding. Though of more than average height, he was handsome and agile,<br>and he would have been an altogether exemplary cadet had it not been for<br>his quick temper. He was remarkably truthful, and was neither dissipated<br>nor addicted to drink. The only faults that marred his conduct were<br>fits of fury to which he was subject and during which he lost control of<br>himself and became like a wild animal. He once nearly threw out of the<br>window another cadet who had begun to tease him about his collection<br>of minerals. On another occasion he came almost completely to grief<br>by flinging a whole dish of cutlets at an officer who was acting as<br>steward, attacking him and, it was said, striking him for having broken<br>his word and told a barefaced lie. He would certainly have been reduced<br>to the ranks had not the Director of the College hushed up the whole<br>matter and dismissed the steward. </p><p>By the time he was eighteen he had finished his College course and<br>received a commission as lieutenant in an aristocratic regiment of the<br>Guards. </p><p>The Emperor Nicholas Pavlovich (Nicholas I) had noticed him while he<br>was still at the College, and continued to take notice of him in the<br>regiment, and it was on this account that people predicted for him an<br>appointment as aide-de-camp to the Emperor. Kasatsky himself strongly<br>desired it, not from ambition only but chiefly because since his cadet<br>days he had been passionately devoted to Nicholas Pavlovich. The Emperor<br>had often visited the Military College and every time Kasatsky saw<br>that tall erect figure, with breast expanded in its military overcoat,<br>entering with brisk step, saw the cropped side-whiskers, the moustache,<br>the aquiline nose, and heard the sonorous voice exchanging greetings<br>with the cadets, he was seized by the same rapture that he experienced<br>later on when he met the woman he loved. Indeed, his passionate<br>adoration of the Emperor was even stronger: he wished to sacrifice<br>something--everything, even himself--to prove his complete devotion.<br>And the Emperor Nicholas was conscious of evoking this rapture and<br>deliberately aroused it. He played with the cadets, surrounded himself<br>with them, treating them sometimes with childish simplicity, sometimes<br>as a friend, and then again with majestic solemnity. After that affair<br>with the officer, Nicholas Pavlovich said nothing to Kasatsky, but when<br>the latter approached he waved him away theatrically, frowned, shook his<br>finger at him, and afterwards when leaving, said: 'Remember that I know<br>everything. There are some things I would rather not know, but they<br>remain here,' and he pointed to his heart. </p><p>When on leaving College the cadets were received by the Emperor, he did<br>not again refer to Kasatsky's offence, but told them all, as was his<br>custom, that they should serve him and the fatherland loyally, that he<br>would always be their best friend, and that when necessary they might<br>approach him direct. All the cadets were as usual greatly moved, and<br>Kasatsky even shed tears, remembering the past, and vowed that he would<br>serve his beloved Tsar with all his soul. </p><p>When Kasatsky took up his commission his mother moved with her daughter<br>first to Moscow and then to their country estate. Kasatsky gave half his<br>property to his sister and kept only enough to maintain himself in the<br>expensive regiment he had joined. </p><p>To all appearance he was just an ordinary, brilliant young officer<br>of the Guards making a career for himself; but intense and complex<br>strivings went on within him. From early childhood his efforts had<br>seemed to be very varied, but essentially they were all one and the<br>same. He tried in everything he took up to attain such success and<br>perfection as would evoke praise and surprise. Whether it was his<br>studies or his military exercises, he took them up and worked at them<br>till he was praised and held up as an example to others. Mastering one<br>subject he took up another, and obtained first place in his studies. For<br>example, while still at College he noticed in himself an awkwardness in<br>French conversation, and contrived to master French till he spoke it<br>as well as Russian, and then he took up chess and became an excellent<br>player. </p><p>Apart from his main vocation, which was the service of his Tsar and<br>the fatherland, he always set himself some particular aim, and however<br>unimportant it was, devoted himself completely to it and lived for it<br>until it was accomplished. And as soon as it was attained another<br>aim would immediately present itself, replacing its predecessor. This<br>passion for distinguishing himself, or for accomplishing something<br>in order to distinguish himself, filled his life. On taking up his<br>commission he set himself to acquire the utmost perfection in knowledge<br>of the service, and very soon became a model officer, though still with<br>the same fault of ungovernable irascibility, which here in the service<br>again led him to commit actions inimical to his success. Then he took to<br>reading, having once in conversation in society felt himself deficient<br>in general education--and again achieved his purpose. Then, wishing<br>to secure a brilliant position in high society, he learnt to dance<br>excellently and very soon was invited to all the balls in the best<br>circles, and to some of their evening gatherings. But this did not<br>satisfy him: he was accustomed to being first, and in this society was<br>far from being so. </p><p>The highest society then consisted, and I think always consist, of<br>four sorts of people: rich people who are received at Court, people<br>not wealthy but born and brought up in Court circles, rich people who<br>ingratiate themselves into the Court set, and people neither rich nor<br>belonging to the Court but who ingratiate themselves into the first and<br>second sets. </p><p>Kasatsky did not belong to the first two sets, but was readily welcomed<br>in the others. On entering society he determined to have relations with<br>some society lady, and to his own surprise quickly accomplished this<br>purpose. He soon realized, however, that the circles in which he moved<br>were not the highest, and that though he was received in the highest<br>spheres he did not belong to them. They were polite to him, but showed<br>by their whole manner that they had their own set and that he was not of<br>it. And Kasatsky wished to belong to that inner circle. To attain that<br>end it would be necessary to be an aide-de-camp to the Emperor--which<br>he expected to become--or to marry into that exclusive set, which he<br>resolved to do. And his choice fell on a beauty belonging to the<br>Court, who not merely belonged to the circle into which he wished to be<br>accepted, but whose friendship was coveted by the very highest people<br>and those most firmly established in that highest circle. This was<br>Countess Korotkova. Kasatsky began to pay court to her, and not merely<br>for the sake of his career. She was extremely attractive and he soon<br>fell in love with her. At first she was noticeably cool towards him,<br>but then suddenly changed and became gracious, and her mother gave him<br>pressing invitations to visit them. Kasatsky proposed and was accepted.<br>He was surprised at the facility with which he attained such happiness.<br>But though he noticed something strange and unusual in the behaviour<br>towards him of both mother and daughter, he was blinded by being<br>so deeply in love, and did not realize what almost the whole town<br>knew--namely, that his fiancee had been the Emperor Nicholas's mistress<br>the previous year. </p><p>Two weeks before the day arranged for the wedding, Kasatsky was at<br>Tsarskoe Selo at his fiancee's country place. It was a hot day in May.<br>He and his betrothed had walked about the garden and were sitting on<br>a bench in a shady linden alley. Mary's white muslin dress suited her<br>particularly well, and she seemed the personification of innocence and<br>love as she sat, now bending her head, now gazing up at the very tall<br>and handsome man who was speaking to her with particular tenderness and<br>self-restraint, as if he feared by word or gesture to offend or sully<br>her angelic purity. </p><p>Kasatsky belonged to those men of the eighteen-forties (they are now no<br>longer to be found) who while deliberately and without any conscientious<br>scruples condoning impurity in themselves, required ideal and angelic<br>purity in their women, regarded all unmarried women of their circle as<br>possessed of such purity, and treated them accordingly. There was much<br>that was false and harmful in this outlook, as concerning the laxity the<br>men permitted themselves, but in regard to the women that old-fashioned<br>view (sharply differing from that held by young people to-day who see in<br>every girl merely a female seeking a mate) was, I think, of value. The<br>girls, perceiving such adoration, endeavoured with more or less success<br>to be goddesses. </p><p>Such was the view Kasatsky held of women, and that was how he regarded<br>his fiancee. He was particularly in love that day, but did not<br>experience any sensual desire for her. On the contrary he regarded her<br>with tender adoration as something unattainable. </p><p>He rose to his full height, standing before her with both hands on his<br>sabre. </p><p>'I have only now realized what happiness a man can experience! And it is<br>you, my darling, who have given me this happiness,' he said with a timid<br>smile. </p><p>Endearments had not yet become usual between them, and feeling himself<br>morally inferior he felt terrified at this stage to use them to such an<br>angel. </p><p>'It is thanks to you that I have come to know myself. I have learnt that<br>I am better than I thought.' </p><p>'I have known that for a long time. That was why I began to love you.' </p><p>Nightingales trilled near by and the fresh leafage rustled, moved by a<br>passing breeze. </p><p>He took her hand and kissed it, and tears came into his eyes. </p><p>She understood that he was thanking her for having said she loved him.<br>He silently took a few steps up and down, and then approached her again<br>and sat down. </p><p>'You know . . . I have to tell you . . . I was not disinterested when I<br>began to make love to you. I wanted to get into society; but later . . .<br>how unimportant that became in comparison with you--when I got to know<br>you. You are not angry with me for that?' </p><p>She did not reply but merely touched his hand. He understood that this<br>meant: 'No, I am not angry.' </p><p>'You said . . .' He hesitated. It seemed too bold to say. 'You said that<br>you began to love me. I believe it--but there is something that troubles<br>you and checks your feeling. What is it?' </p><p>'Yes--now or never!' thought she. 'He is bound to know of it anyway. But<br>now he will not forsake me. Ah, if he should, it would be terrible!' And<br>she threw a loving glance at his tall, noble, powerful figure. She loved<br>him now more than she had loved the Tsar, and apart from the Imperial<br>dignity would not have preferred the Emperor to him. </p><p>'Listen! I cannot deceive you. I have to tell you. You ask what it is?<br>It is that I have loved before.' </p><p>She again laid her hand on his with an imploring gesture. He was silent. </p><p>'You want to know who it was? It was--the Emperor.' </p><p>'We all love him. I can imagine you, a schoolgirl at the Institute . . .' </p><p>'No, it was later. I was infatuated, but it passed . . . I must tell<br>you . . .' </p><p>'Well, what of it?' </p><p>'No, it was not simply--' She covered her face with her hands. </p><p>'What? You gave yourself to him?' </p><p>She was silent. </p><p>'His mistress?' </p><p>She did not answer. </p><p>He sprang up and stood before her with trembling jaws, pale as death. He<br>now remembered how the Emperor, meeting him on the Nevsky, had amiably<br>congratulated him. </p><p>'O God, what have I done! Stiva!' </p><p>'Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Oh, how it pains!' </p><p>He turned away and went to the house. There he met her mother. </p><p>'What is the matter, Prince? I . . .' She became silent on seeing his<br>face. The blood had suddenly rushed to his head. </p><p>'You knew it, and used me to shield them! If you weren't a woman . . . !'<br>he cried, lifting his enormous fist, and turning aside he ran away. </p><p>Had his fiancee's lover been a private person he would have killed him,<br>but it was his beloved Tsar. </p><p>Next day he applied both for furlough and his discharge, and professing<br>to be ill, so as to see no one, he went away to the country. </p><p>He spent the summer at his village arranging his affairs. When summer<br>was over he did not return to Petersburg, but entered a monastery and<br>there became a monk. </p><p>His mother wrote to try to dissuade him from this decisive step, but<br>he replied that he felt God's call which transcended all other<br>considerations. Only his sister, who was as proud and ambitious as he,<br>understood him. </p><p>She understood that he had become a monk in order to be above those who<br>considered themselves his superiors. And she understood him correctly.<br>By becoming a monk he showed contempt for all that seemed most important<br>to others and had seemed so to him while he was in the service, and<br>he now ascended a height from which he could look down on those he had<br>formerly envied. . . . But it was not this alone, as his sister Varvara<br>supposed, that influenced him. There was also in him something else--a<br>sincere religious feeling which Varvara did not know, which intertwined<br>itself with the feeling of pride and the desire for pre-eminence,<br>and guided him. His disillusionment with Mary, whom he had thought<br>of angelic purity, and his sense of injury, were so strong that they<br>brought him to despair, and the despair led him--to what? To God, to his<br>childhood's faith which had never been destroyed in him. </p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>II </p><p>Kasatsky entered the monastery on the feast of the Intercession of the<br>Blessed Virgin. The Abbot of that monastery was a gentleman by birth, a<br>learned writer and a starets, that is, he belonged to that succession<br>of monks originating in Walachia who each choose a director and teacher<br>whom they implicitly obey. This Superior had been a disciple of the<br>starets Ambrose, who was a disciple of Makarius, who was a disciple of<br>the starets Leonid, who was a disciple of Paussy Velichkovsky. </p><p>To this Abbot Kasatsky submitted himself as to his chosen director. Here<br>in the monastery, besides the feeling of ascendency over others that<br>such a life gave him, he felt much as he had done in the world: he found<br>satisfaction in attaining the greatest possible perfection outwardly<br>as well as inwardly. As in the regiment he had been not merely an<br>irreproachable officer but had even exceeded his duties and widened the<br>borders of perfection, so also as a monk he tried to be perfect, and was<br>always industrious, abstemious, submissive, and meek, as well as<br>pure both in deed and in thought, and obedient. This last quality in<br>particular made life far easier for him. If many of the demands of life<br>in the monastery, which was near the capital and much frequented, did<br>not please him and were temptations to him, they were all nullified by<br>obedience: 'It is not for me to reason; my business is to do the task<br>set me, whether it be standing beside the relics, singing in the choir,<br>or making up accounts in the monastery guest-house.' All possibility of<br>doubt about anything was silenced by obedience to the starets. Had<br>it not been for this, he would have been oppressed by the length and<br>monotony of the church services, the bustle of the many visitors, and<br>the bad qualities of the other monks. As it was, he not only bore it<br>all joyfully but found in it solace and support. 'I don't know why it is<br>necessary to hear the same prayers several times a day, but I know that<br>it is necessary; and knowing this I find joy in them.' His director told<br>him that as material food is necessary for the maintenance of the life<br>of the body, so spiritual food--the church prayers--is necessary for<br>the maintenance of the spiritual life. He believed this, and though the<br>church services, for which he had to get up early in the morning, were<br>a difficulty, they certainly calmed him and gave him joy. This was the<br>result of his consciousness of humility, and the certainty that whatever<br>he had to do, being fixed by the starets, was right. </p><p>The interest of his life consisted not only in an ever greater and<br>greater subjugation of his will, but in the attainment of all the<br>Christian virtues, which at first seemed to him easily attainable. He<br>had given his whole estate to his sister and did not regret it, he had<br>no personal claims, humility towards his inferiors was not merely easy<br>for him but afforded him pleasure. Even victory over the sins of the<br>flesh, greed and lust, was easily attained. His director had specially<br>warned him against the latter sin, but Kasatsky felt free from it and<br>was glad. </p><p>One thing only tormented him--the remembrance of his fiancee; and not<br>merely the remembrance but the vivid image of what might have been.<br>Involuntarily he recalled a lady he knew who had been a favourite of the<br>Emperor's, but had afterwards married and become an admirable wife and<br>mother. The husband had a high position, influence and honour, and a<br>good and penitent wife. </p><p>In his better hours Kasatsky was not disturbed by such thoughts, and<br>when he recalled them at such times he was merely glad to feel that the<br>temptation was past. But there were moments when all that made up his<br>present life suddenly grew dim before him, moments when, if he did not<br>cease to believe in the aims he had set himself, he ceased to see them<br>and could evoke no confidence in them but was seized by a remembrance<br>of, and--terrible to say--a regret for, the change of life he had made. </p><p>The only thing that saved him in that state of mind was obedience and<br>work, and the fact that the whole day was occupied by prayer. He went<br>through the usual forms of prayer, he bowed in prayer, he even prayed<br>more than usual, but it was lip-service only and his soul was not in it.<br>This condition would continue for a day, or sometimes for two days, and<br>would then pass of itself. But those days were dreadful. Kasatsky felt<br>that he was neither in his own hands nor in God's, but was subject<br>to something else. All he could do then was to obey the starets, to<br>restrain himself, to undertake nothing, and simply to wait. In general<br>all this time he lived not by his own will but by that of the starets,<br>and in this obedience he found a special tranquillity. </p><p>So he lived in his first monastery for seven years. At the end of the<br>third year he received the tonsure and was ordained to the priesthood by<br>the name of Sergius. The profession was an important event in his inner<br>life. He had previously experienced a great consolation and spiritual<br>exaltation when receiving communion, and now when he himself officiated,<br>the performance of the preparation filled him with ecstatic and deep<br>emotion. But subsequently that feeling became more and more deadened,<br>and once when he was officiating in a depressed state of mind he felt<br>that the influence produced on him by the service would not endure. And<br>it did in fact weaken till only the habit remained. </p><p>In general in the seventh year of his life in the monastery Sergius grew<br>weary. He had learnt all there was to learn and had attained all there<br>was to attain, there was nothing more to do and his spiritual drowsiness<br>increased. During this time he heard of his mother's death and his<br>sister Varvara's marriage, but both events were matters of indifference<br>to him. His whole attention and his whole interest were concentrated on<br>his inner life. </p><p>In the fourth year of his priesthood, during which the Bishop had been<br>particularly kind to him, the starets told him that he ought not to<br>decline it if he were offered an appointment to higher duties. Then<br>monastic ambition, the very thing he had found so repulsive in other<br>monks, arose within him. He was assigned to a monastery near the<br>metropolis. He wished to refuse but the starets ordered him to accept<br>the appointment. He did so, and took leave of the starets and moved to<br>the other monastery. </p><p>The exchange into the metropolitan monastery was an important event in<br>Sergius's life. There he encountered many temptations, and his whole<br>will-power was concentrated on meeting them. </p><p>In the first monastery, women had not been a temptation to him, but<br>here that temptation arose with terrible strength and even took definite<br>shape. There was a lady known for her frivolous behaviour who began to<br>seek his favour. She talked to him and asked him to visit her. Sergius<br>sternly declined, but was horrified by the definiteness of his desire.<br>He was so alarmed that he wrote about it to the starets. And in<br>addition, to keep himself in hand, he spoke to a young novice and,<br>conquering his sense of shame, confessed his weakness to him, asking him<br>to keep watch on him and not let him go anywhere except to service and<br>to fulfil his duties. </p><p>Besides this, a great pitfall for Sergius lay in the fact of his extreme<br>antipathy to his new Abbot, a cunning worldly man who was making a<br>career for himself in the Church. Struggle with himself as he might, he<br>could not master that feeling. He was submissive to the Abbot, but in<br>the depths of his soul he never ceased to condemn him. And in the second<br>year of his residence at the new monastery that ill-feeling broke out. </p><p>The Vigil service was being performed in the large church on the eve of<br>the feast of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin, and there were many<br>visitors. The Abbot himself was conducting the service. Father Sergius<br>was standing in his usual place and praying: that is, he was in that<br>condition of struggle which always occupied him during the service,<br>especially in the large church when he was not himself conducting the<br>service. This conflict was occasioned by his irritation at the presence<br>of fine folk, especially ladies. He tried not to see them or to notice<br>all that went on: how a soldier conducted them, pushing the<br>common people aside, how the ladies pointed out the monks to one<br>another--especially himself and a monk noted for his good looks. He<br>tried as it were to keep his mind in blinkers, to see nothing but<br>the light of the candles on the altar-screen, the icons, and those<br>conducting the service. He tried to hear nothing but the prayers<br>that were being chanted or read, to feel nothing but self-oblivion in<br>consciousness of the fulfilment of duty--a feeling he always experienced<br>when hearing or reciting in advance the prayers he had so often heard. </p><p>So he stood, crossing and prostrating himself when necessary, and<br>struggled with himself, now giving way to cold condemnation and now to<br>a consciously evoked obliteration of thought and feeling. Then the<br>sacristan, Father Nicodemus--also a great stumbling-block to Sergius<br>who involuntarily reproached him for flattering and fawning on the<br>Abbot--approached him and, bowing low, requested his presence behind the<br>holy gates. Father Sergius straightened his mantle, put on his biretta,<br>and went circumspectly through the crowd. </p><p>'Lise, regarde a droite, c'est lui!' he heard a woman's voice say. </p><p>'Ou, ou? Il n'est pas tellement beau.' </p><p>He knew that they were speaking of him. He heard them and, as always<br>at moments of temptation, he repeated the words, 'Lead us not into<br>temptation,' and bowing his head and lowering his eyes went past the<br>ambo and in by the north door, avoiding the canons in their cassocks who<br>were just then passing the altar-screen. On entering the sanctuary he<br>bowed, crossing himself as usual and bending double before the icons.<br>Then, raising his head but without turning, he glanced out of the corner<br>of his eye at the Abbot, whom he saw standing beside another glittering<br>figure. </p><p>The Abbot was standing by the wall in his vestments. Having freed his<br>short plump hands from beneath his chasuble he had folded them over<br>his fat body and protruding stomach, and fingering the cords of his<br>vestments was smilingly saying something to a military man in the<br>uniform of a general of the Imperial suite, with its insignia<br>and shoulder-knots which Father Sergius's experienced eye at once<br>recognized. This general had been the commander of the regiment in which<br>Sergius had served. He now evidently occupied an important position, and<br>Father Sergius at once noticed that the Abbot was aware of this and that<br>his red face and bald head beamed with satisfaction and pleasure. This<br>vexed and disgusted Father Sergius, the more so when he heard that the<br>Abbot had only sent for him to satisfy the general's curiosity to see a<br>man who had formerly served with him, as he expressed it. </p><p>'Very pleased to see you in your angelic guise,' said the general,<br>holding out his hand. 'I hope you have not forgotten an old comrade.' </p><p>The whole thing--the Abbot's red, smiling face amid its fringe of grey,<br>the general's words, his well-cared-for face with its self-satisfied<br>smile and the smell of wine from his breath and of cigars from his<br>whiskers--revolted Father Sergius. He bowed again to the Abbot and said: </p><p>'Your reverence deigned to send for me?'--and stopped, the whole<br>expression of his face and eyes asking why. </p><p>'Yes, to meet the General,' replied the Abbot. </p><p>'Your reverence, I left the world to save myself from temptation,' said<br>Father Sergius, turning pale and with quivering lips. 'Why do you expose<br>me to it during prayers and in God's house?' </p><p>'You may go! Go!' said the Abbot, flaring up and frowning. </p><p>Next day Father Sergius asked pardon of the Abbot and of the brethren<br>for his pride, but at the same time, after a night spent in prayer, he<br>decided that he must leave this monastery, and he wrote to the starets<br>begging permission to return to him. He wrote that he felt his weakness<br>and incapacity to struggle against temptation without his help and<br>penitently confessed his sin of pride. By return of post came a letter<br>from the starets, who wrote that Sergius's pride was the cause of all<br>that had happened. The old man pointed out that his fits of anger were<br>due to the fact that in refusing all clerical honours he humiliated<br>himself not for the sake of God but for the sake of his pride. 'There<br>now, am I not a splendid man not to want anything?' That was why he<br>could not tolerate the Abbot's action. 'I have renounced everything for<br>the glory of God, and here I am exhibited like a wild beast!' 'Had you<br>renounced vanity for God's sake you would have borne it. Worldly pride<br>is not yet dead in you. I have thought about you, Sergius my son, and<br>prayed also, and this is what God has suggested to me. At the Tambov<br>hermitage the anchorite Hilary, a man of saintly life, has died. He had<br>lived there eighteen years. The Tambov Abbot is asking whether there is<br>not a brother who would take his place. And here comes your letter. Go<br>to Father Paissy of the Tambov Monastery. I will write to him about you,<br>and you must ask for Hilary's cell. Not that you can replace Hilary, but<br>you need solitude to quell your pride. May God bless you!' </p><p>Sergius obeyed the starets, showed his letter to the Abbot, and having<br>obtained his permission, gave up his cell, handed all his possessions<br>over to the monastery, and set out for the Tambov hermitage. </p><p>There the Abbot, an excellent manager of merchant origin, received<br>Sergius simply and quietly and placed him in Hilary's cell, at first<br>assigning to him a lay brother but afterwards leaving him alone, at<br>Sergius's own request. The cell was a dual cave, dug into the hillside,<br>and in it Hilary had been buried. In the back part was Hilary's grave,<br>while in the front was a niche for sleeping, with a straw mattress, a<br>small table, and a shelf with icons and books. Outside the outer door,<br>which fastened with a hook, was another shelf on which, once a day, a<br>monk placed food from the monastery. </p><p>And so Sergius became a hermit. </p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>III </p><p>At Carnival time, in the sixth year of Sergius's life at the hermitage,<br>a merry company of rich people, men and women from a neighbouring town,<br>made up a troyka-party, after a meal of carnival-pancakes and wine. The<br>company consisted of two lawyers, a wealthy landowner, an officer, and<br>four ladies. One lady was the officer's wife, another the wife of<br>the landowner, the third his sister--a young girl--and the fourth a<br>divorcee, beautiful, rich, and eccentric, who amazed and shocked the<br>town by her escapades. </p><p>The weather was excellent and the snow-covered road smooth as a floor.<br>They drove some seven miles out of town, and then stopped and consulted<br>as to whether they should turn back or drive farther. </p><p>'But where does this road lead to?' asked Makovkina, the beautiful<br>divorcee. </p><p>'To Tambov, eight miles from here,' replied one of the lawyers, who was<br>having a flirtation with her. </p><p>'And then where?' </p><p>'Then on to L----, past the Monastery.' </p><p>'Where that Father Sergius lives?' </p><p>'Yes.' </p><p>'Kasatsky, the handsome hermit?' </p><p>'Yes.' </p><p>'Mesdames et messieurs, let us drive on and see Kasatsky! We can stop at<br>Tambov and have something to eat.' </p><p>'But we shouldn't get home to-night!' </p><p>'Never mind, we will stay at Kasatsky's.' </p><p>'Well, there is a very good hostelry at the Monastery. I stayed there<br>when I was defending Makhin.' </p><p>'No, I shall spend the night at Kasatsky's!' </p><p>'Impossible! Even your omnipotence could not accomplish that!' </p><p>'Impossible? Will you bet?' </p><p>'All right! If you spend the night with him, the stake shall be whatever<br>you like.' </p><p>'A DISCRETION!' </p><p>'But on your side too!' </p><p>'Yes, of course. Let us drive on.' </p><p>Vodka was handed to the drivers, and the party got out a box of pies,<br>wine, and sweets for themselves. The ladies wrapped up in their white<br>dogskins. The drivers disputed as to whose troyka should go ahead, and<br>the youngest, seating himself sideways with a dashing air, swung his<br>long knout and shouted to the horses. The troyka-bells tinkled and the<br>sledge-runners squeaked over the snow. </p><p>The sledge swayed hardly at all. The shaft-horse, with his tightly bound<br>tail under his decorated breechband, galloped smoothly and briskly; the<br>smooth road seemed to run rapidly backwards, while the driver dashingly<br>shook the reins. One of the lawyers and the officer sitting opposite<br>talked nonsense to Makovkina's neighbour, but Makovkina herself sat<br>motionless and in thought, tightly wrapped in her fur. 'Always the same<br>and always nasty! The same red shiny faces smelling of wine and cigars!<br>The same talk, the same thoughts, and always about the same things! And<br>they are all satisfied and confident that it should be so, and will<br>go on living like that till they die. But I can't. It bores me. I want<br>something that would upset it all and turn it upside down. Suppose<br>it happened to us as to those people--at Saratov was it?--who kept on<br>driving and froze to death. . . . What would our people do? How would<br>they behave? Basely, for certain. Each for himself. And I too should act<br>badly. But I at any rate have beauty. They all know it. And how about<br>that monk? Is it possible that he has become indifferent to it? No! That<br>is the one thing they all care for--like that cadet last autumn. What a<br>fool he was!' </p><p>'Ivan Nikolaevich!' she said aloud. </p><p>'What are your commands?' </p><p>'How old is he?' </p><p>'Who?' </p><p>'Kasatsky.' </p><p>'Over forty, I should think.' </p><p>'And does he receive all visitors?' </p><p>'Yes, everybody, but not always.' </p><p>'Cover up my feet. Not like that--how clumsy you are! No! More,<br>more--like that! But you need not squeeze them!' </p><p>So they came to the forest where the cell was. </p><p>Makovkina got out of the sledge, and told them to drive on. They tried<br>to dissuade her, but she grew irritable and ordered them to go on. </p><p>When the sledges had gone she went up the path in her white dogskin<br>coat. The lawyer got out and stopped to watch her. </p><p>It was Father Sergius's sixth year as a recluse, and he was now<br>forty-nine. His life in solitude was hard--not on account of the fasts<br>and the prayers (they were no hardship to him) but on account of an<br>inner conflict he had not at all anticipated. The sources of that<br>conflict were two: doubts, and the lust of the flesh. And these two<br>enemies always appeared together. It seemed to him that they were two<br>foes, but in reality they were one and the same. As soon as doubt was<br>gone so was the lustful desire. But thinking them to be two different<br>fiends he fought them separately. </p><p>'O my God, my God!' thought he. 'Why dost thou not grant me faith? There<br>is lust, of course: even the saints had to fight that--Saint Anthony and<br>others. But they had faith, while I have moments, hours, and days, when<br>it is absent. Why does the whole world, with all its delights, exist<br>if it is sinful and must be renounced? Why hast Thou created this<br>temptation? Temptation? Is it not rather a temptation that I wish to<br>abandon all the joys of earth and prepare something for myself there<br>where perhaps there is nothing?' And he became horrified and filled with<br>disgust at himself. 'Vile creature! And it is you who wish to become a<br>saint!' he upbraided himself, and he began to pray. But as soon as he<br>started to pray he saw himself vividly as he had been at the Monastery,<br>in a majestic post in biretta and mantle, and he shook his head. 'No,<br>that is not right. It is deception. I may deceive others, but not myself<br>or God. I am not a majestic man, but a pitiable and ridiculous one!' And<br>he threw back the folds of his cassock and smiled as he looked at his<br>thin legs in their underclothing. </p><p>Then he dropped the folds of the cassock again and began reading the<br>prayers, making the sign of the cross and prostrating himself. 'Can<br>it be that this couch will be my bier?' he read. And it seemed as if a<br>devil whispered to him: 'A solitary couch is itself a bier. Falsehood!'<br>And in imagination he saw the shoulders of a widow with whom he had<br>lived. He shook himself, and went on reading. Having read the precepts<br>he took up the Gospels, opened the book, and happened on a passage<br>he often repeated and knew by heart: 'Lord, I believe. Help thou my<br>unbelief!'--and he put away all the doubts that had arisen. As one<br>replaces an object of insecure equilibrium, so he carefully replaced his<br>belief on its shaky pedestal and carefully stepped back from it so as<br>not to shake or upset it. The blinkers were adjusted again and he felt<br>tranquillized, and repeating his childhood's prayer: 'Lord, receive me,<br>receive me!' he felt not merely at ease, but thrilled and joyful. He<br>crossed himself and lay down on the bedding on his narrow bench, tucking<br>his summer cassock under his head. He fell asleep at once, and in his<br>light slumber he seemed to hear the tinkling of sledge bells. He did not<br>know whether he was dreaming or awake, but a knock at the door aroused<br>him. He sat up, distrusting his senses, but the knock was repeated. Yes,<br>it was a knock close at hand, at his door, and with it the sound of a<br>woman's voice. </p><p>'My God! Can it be true, as I have read in the Lives of the Saints, that<br>the devil takes on the form of a woman? Yes--it is a woman's voice.<br>And a tender, timid, pleasant voice. Phui!' And he spat to exorcise the<br>devil. 'No, it was only my imagination,' he assured himself, and he<br>went to the corner where his lectern stood, falling on his knees in the<br>regular and habitual manner which of itself gave him consolation and<br>satisfaction. He sank down, his hair hanging over his face, and pressed<br>his head, already going bald in front, to the cold damp strip of drugget<br>on the draughty floor. He read the psalm old Father Pimon had told him<br>warded off temptation. He easily raised his light and emaciated body<br>on his strong sinewy legs and tried to continue saying his prayers, but<br>instead of doing so he involuntarily strained his hearing. He wished<br>to hear more. All was quiet. From the corner of the roof regular drops<br>continued to fall into the tub below. Outside was a mist and fog eating<br>into the snow that lay on the ground. It was still, very still. And<br>suddenly there was a rustling at the window and a voice--that<br>same tender, timid voice, which could only belong to an attractive<br>woman--said: </p><p>'Let me in, for Christ's sake!' </p><p>It seemed as though his blood had all rushed to his heart and settled<br>there. He could hardly breathe. 'Let God arise and let his enemies be<br>scattered . . .' </p><p>'But I am not a devil!' It was obvious that the lips that uttered this<br>were smiling. 'I am not a devil, but only a sinful woman who has lost<br>her way, not figuratively but literally!' She laughed. 'I am frozen and<br>beg for shelter.' </p><p>He pressed his face to the window, but the little icon-lamp was<br>reflected by it and shone on the whole pane. He put his hands to both<br>sides of his face and peered between them. Fog, mist, a tree, and--just<br>opposite him--she herself. Yes, there, a few inches from him, was the<br>sweet, kindly frightened face of a woman in a cap and a coat of long<br>white fur, leaning towards him. Their eyes met with instant recognition:<br>not that they had ever known one another, they had never met before,<br>but by the look they exchanged they--and he particularly--felt that they<br>knew and understood one another. After that glance to imagine her to be<br>a devil and not a simple, kindly, sweet, timid woman, was impossible. </p><p>'Who are you? Why have you come?' he asked. </p><p>'Do please open the door!' she replied, with capricious authority. 'I am<br>frozen. I tell you I have lost my way.' </p><p>'But I am a monk--a hermit.' </p><p>'Oh, do please open the door--or do you wish me to freeze under your<br>window while you say your prayers?' </p><p>'But how have you . . .' </p><p>'I shan't eat you. For God's sake let me in! I am quite frozen.' </p><p>She really did feel afraid, and said this in an almost tearful voice. </p><p>He stepped back from the window and looked at an icon of the Saviour<br>in His crown of thorns. 'Lord, help me! Lord, help me!' he exclaimed,<br>crossing himself and bowing low. Then he went to the door, and opening<br>it into the tiny porch, felt for the hook that fastened the outer door<br>and began to lift it. He heard steps outside. She was coming from the<br>window to the door. 'Ah!' she suddenly exclaimed, and he understood<br>that she had stepped into the puddle that the dripping from the roof had<br>formed at the threshold. His hands trembled, and he could not raise the<br>hook of the tightly closed door. </p><p>'Oh, what are you doing? Let me in! I am all wet. I am frozen! You are<br>thinking about saving your soul and are letting me freeze to death . . .' </p><p>He jerked the door towards him, raised the hook, and without considering<br>what he was doing, pushed it open with such force that it struck her. </p><p>'Oh--PARDON!' he suddenly exclaimed, reverting completely to his old<br>manner with ladies. </p><p>She smiled on hearing that PARDON. 'He is not quite so terrible, after<br>all,' she thought. 'It's all right. It is you who must pardon me,' she<br>said, stepping past him. 'I should never have ventured, but such an<br>extraordinary circumstance . . .' </p><p>'If you please!' he uttered, and stood aside to let her pass him. A<br>strong smell of fine scent, which he had long not encountered, struck<br>him. She went through the little porch into the cell where he lived. He<br>closed the outer door without fastening the hook, and stepped in after<br>her. </p><p>'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner! Lord, have<br>mercy on me a sinner!' he prayed unceasingly, not merely to himself but<br>involuntarily moving his lips. 'If you please!' he said to her again.<br>She stood in the middle of the room, moisture dripping from her to the<br>floor as she looked him over. Her eyes were laughing. </p><p>'Forgive me for having disturbed your solitude. But you see what a<br>position I am in. It all came about from our starting from town for a<br>sledge-drive, and my making a bet that I would walk back by myself from<br>the Vorobevka to the town. But then I lost my way, and if I had not<br>happened to come upon your cell . . .' She began lying, but his face<br>confused her so that she could not continue, but became silent. She had<br>not expected him to be at all such as he was. He was not as handsome<br>as she had imagined, but was nevertheless beautiful in her eyes: his<br>greyish hair and beard, slightly curling, his fine, regular nose,<br>and his eyes like glowing coal when he looked at her, made a strong<br>impression on her. </p><p>He saw that she was lying. </p><p>'Yes . . . so,' said he, looking at her and again lowering his eyes. 'I<br>will go in there, and this place is at your disposal.' </p><p>And taking down the little lamp, he lit a candle, and bowing low to her<br>went into the small cell beyond the partition, and she heard him begin<br>to move something about there. 'Probably he is barricading himself in<br>from me!' she thought with a smile, and throwing off her white dogskin<br>cloak she tried to take off her cap, which had become entangled in her<br>hair and in the woven kerchief she was wearing under it. She had not<br>got at all wet when standing under the window, and had said so only as<br>a pretext to get him to let her in. But she really had stepped into the<br>puddle at the door, and her left foot was wet up to the ankle and her<br>overshoe full of water. She sat down on his bed--a bench only covered by<br>a bit of carpet--and began to take off her boots. The little cell seemed<br>to her charming. The narrow little room, some seven feet by nine, was as<br>clean as glass. There was nothing in it but the bench on which she<br>was sitting, the book-shelf above it, and a lectern in the corner.<br>A sheepskin coat and a cassock hung on nails by the door. Above the<br>lectern was the little lamp and an icon of Christ in His crown of<br>thorns. The room smelt strangely of perspiration and of earth. It all<br>pleased her--even that smell. Her wet feet, especially one of them, were<br>uncomfortable, and she quickly began to take off her boots and stockings<br>without ceasing to smile, pleased not so much at having achieved her<br>object as because she perceived that she had abashed that charming,<br>strange, striking, and attractive man. 'He did not respond, but what of<br>that?' she said to herself. </p><p>'Father Sergius! Father Sergius! Or how does one call you?' </p><p>'What do you want?' replied a quiet voice. </p><p>'Please forgive me for disturbing your solitude, but really I could not<br>help it. I should simply have fallen ill. And I don't know that I shan't<br>now. I am all wet and my feet are like ice.' </p><p>'Pardon me,' replied the quiet voice. 'I cannot be of any assistance to<br>you.' </p><p>'I would not have disturbed you if I could have helped it. I am only<br>here till daybreak.' </p><p>He did not reply and she heard him muttering something, probably his<br>prayers. </p><p>'You will not be coming in here?' she asked, smiling. 'For I must<br>undress to dry myself.' </p><p>He did not reply, but continued to read his prayers. </p><p>'Yes, that is a man!' thought she, getting her dripping boot off with<br>difficulty. She tugged at it, but could not get it off. The absurdity of<br>it struck her and she began to laugh almost inaudibly. But knowing that<br>he would hear her laughter and would be moved by it just as she wished<br>him to be, she laughed louder, and her laughter--gay, natural, and<br>kindly--really acted on him just in the way she wished. </p><p>'Yes, I could love a man like that--such eyes and such a simple noble<br>face, and passionate too despite all the prayers he mutters!' thought<br>she. 'You can't deceive a woman in these things. As soon as he put his<br>face to the window and saw me, he understood and knew. The glimmer of it<br>was in his eyes and remained there. He began to love me and desired me.<br>Yes--desired!' said she, getting her overshoe and her boot off at last<br>and starting to take off her stockings. To remove those long stockings<br>fastened with elastic it was necessary to raise her skirts. She felt<br>embarrassed and said: </p><p>'Don't come in!' </p><p>But there was no reply from the other side of the wall. The steady<br>muttering continued and also a sound of moving. </p><p>'He is prostrating himself to the ground, no doubt,' thought she.<br>'But he won't bow himself out of it. He is thinking of me just as I<br>am thinking of him. He is thinking of these feet of mine with the same<br>feeling that I have!' And she pulled off her wet stockings and put her<br>feet up on the bench, pressing them under her. She sat a while like that<br>with her arms round her knees and looking pensively before her. 'But it<br>is a desert, here in this silence. No one would ever know. . . .' </p><p>She rose, took her stockings over to the stove, and hung them on the<br>damper. It was a queer damper, and she turned it about, and then,<br>stepping lightly on her bare feet, returned to the bench and sat down<br>there again with her feet up. </p><p>There was complete silence on the other side of the partition. She<br>looked at the tiny watch that hung round her neck. It was two o'clock.<br>'Our party should return about three!' She had not more than an hour<br>before her. 'Well, am I to sit like this all alone? What nonsense! I<br>don't want to. I will call him at once.' </p><p>'Father Sergius, Father Sergius! Sergey Dmitrich! Prince Kasatsky!' </p><p>Beyond the partition all was silent. </p><p>'Listen! This is cruel. I would not call you if it were not necessary.<br>I am ill. I don't know what is the matter with me!' she exclaimed in a<br>tone of suffering. 'Oh! Oh!' she groaned, falling back on the bench. And<br>strange to say she really felt that her strength was failing, that<br>she was becoming faint, that everything in her ached, and that she was<br>shivering with fever. </p><p>'Listen! Help me! I don't know what is the matter with me. Oh! Oh!' She<br>unfastened her dress, exposing her breast, and lifted her arms, bare to<br>the elbow. 'Oh! Oh!' </p><p>All this time he stood on the other side of the partition and prayed.<br>Having finished all the evening prayers, he now stood motionless, his<br>eyes looking at the end of his nose, and mentally repeated with all his<br>soul: 'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me!' </p><p>But he had heard everything. He had heard how the silk rustled when she<br>took off her dress, how she stepped with bare feet on the floor, and had<br>heard how she rubbed her feet with her hand. He felt his own weakness,<br>and that he might be lost at any moment. That was why he prayed<br>unceasingly. He felt rather as the hero in the fairy-tale must have felt<br>when he had to go on and on without looking round. So Sergius heard and<br>felt that danger and destruction were there, hovering above and<br>around him, and that he could only save himself by not looking in that<br>direction for an instant. But suddenly the desire to look seized him. At<br>the same instant she said: </p><p>'This is inhuman. I may die. . . .' </p><p>'Yes, I will go to her, but like the Saint who laid one hand on the<br>adulteress and thrust his other into the brazier. But there is no<br>brazier here.' He looked round. The lamp! He put his finger over the<br>flame and frowned, preparing himself to suffer. And for a rather long<br>time, as it seemed to him, there was no sensation, but suddenly--he<br>had not yet decided whether it was painful enough--he writhed all over,<br>jerked his hand away, and waved it in the air. 'No, I can't stand that!' </p><p>'For God's sake come to me! I am dying! Oh!' </p><p>'Well--shall I perish? No, not so!' </p><p>'I will come to you directly,' he said, and having opened his door, he<br>went without looking at her through the cell into the porch where he<br>used to chop wood. There he felt for the block and for an axe which<br>leant against the wall. </p><p>'Immediately!' he said, and taking up the axe with his right hand he<br>laid the forefinger of his left hand on the block, swung the axe, and<br>struck with it below the second joint. The finger flew off more lightly<br>than a stick of similar thickness, and bounding up, turned over on the<br>edge of the block and then fell to the floor. </p><p>He heard it fall before he felt any pain, but before he had time to be<br>surprised he felt a burning pain and the warmth of flowing blood. He<br>hastily wrapped the stump in the skirt of his cassock, and pressing it<br>to his hip went back into the room, and standing in front of the woman,<br>lowered his eyes and asked in a low voice: 'What do you want?' </p><p>She looked at his pale face and his quivering left cheek, and suddenly<br>felt ashamed. She jumped up, seized her fur cloak, and throwing it round<br>her shoulders, wrapped herself up in it. </p><p>'I was in pain . . . I have caught cold . . . I . . . Father Sergius<br>. . . I . . .' </p><p>He let his eyes, shining with a quiet light of joy, rest upon her, and<br>said: </p><p>'Dear sister, why did you wish to ruin your immortal soul? Temptations<br>must come into the world, but woe to him by whom temptation comes. Pray<br>that God may forgive us!' </p><p>She listened and looked at him. Suddenly she heard the sound of<br>something dripping. She looked down and saw that blood was flowing from<br>his hand and down his cassock. </p><p>'What have you done to your hand?' She remembered the sound she had<br>heard, and seizing the little lamp ran out into the porch. There on the<br>floor she saw the bloody finger. She returned with her face paler than<br>his and was about to speak to him, but he silently passed into the back<br>cell and fastened the door. </p><p>'Forgive me!' she said. 'How can I atone for my sin?' </p><p>'Go away.' </p><p>'Let me tie up your hand.' </p><p>'Go away from here.' </p><p>She dressed hurriedly and silently, and when ready sat waiting in her<br>furs. The sledge-bells were heard outside. </p><p>'Father Sergius, forgive me!' </p><p>'Go away. God will forgive.' </p><p>'Father Sergius! I will change my life. Do not forsake me!' </p><p>'Go away.' </p><p>'Forgive me--and give me your blessing!' </p><p>'In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost!'--she<br>heard his voice from behind the partition. 'Go!' </p><p>She burst into sobs and left the cell. The lawyer came forward to meet<br>her. </p><p>'Well, I see I have lost the bet. It can't be helped. Where will you<br>sit?' </p><p>'It is all the same to me.' </p><p>She took a seat in the sledge, and did not utter a word all the way<br>home. </p><p>A year later she entered a convent as a novice, and lived a strict life<br>under the direction of the hermit Arseny, who wrote letters to her at<br>long intervals. </p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>IV </p><p>Father Sergius lived as a recluse for another seven years. </p><p>At first he accepted much of what people brought him--tea, sugar, white<br>bread, milk, clothing, and fire-wood. But as time went on he led a more<br>and more austere life, refusing everything superfluous, and finally he<br>accepted nothing but rye-bread once a week. Everything else that was<br>brought to him he gave to the poor who came to him. He spent his entire<br>time in his cell, in prayer or in conversation with callers, who became<br>more and more numerous as time went on. Only three times a year did<br>he go out to church, and when necessary he went out to fetch water and<br>wood. </p><p>The episode with Makovkina had occurred after five years of his hermit<br>life. That occurrence soon became generally known--her nocturnal visit,<br>the change she underwent, and her entry into a convent. From that time<br>Father Sergius's fame increased. More and more visitors came to see him,<br>other monks settled down near his cell, and a church was erected there<br>and also a hostelry. His fame, as usual exaggerating his feats, spread<br>ever more and more widely. People began to come to him from a distance,<br>and began bringing invalids to him whom they declared he cured. </p><p>His first cure occurred in the eighth year of his life as a hermit. It<br>was the healing of a fourteen-year-old boy, whose mother brought him<br>to Father Sergius insisting that he should lay his hand on the child's<br>head. It had never occurred to Father Sergius that he could cure the<br>sick. He would have regarded such a thought as a great sin of pride; but<br>the mother who brought the boy implored him insistently, falling at his<br>feet and saying: 'Why do you, who heal others, refuse to help my son?'<br>She besought him in Christ's name. When Father Sergius assured her that<br>only God could heal the sick, she replied that she only wanted him to<br>lay his hands on the boy and pray for him. Father Sergius refused and<br>returned to his cell. But next day (it was in autumn and the nights were<br>already cold) on going out for water he saw the same mother with her<br>son, a pale boy of fourteen, and was met by the same petition. </p><p>He remembered the parable of the unjust judge, and though he had<br>previously felt sure that he ought to refuse, he now began to hesitate<br>and, having hesitated, took to prayer and prayed until a decision formed<br>itself in his soul. This decision was, that he ought to accede to the<br>woman's request and that her faith might save her son. As for himself,<br>he would in this case be but an insignificant instrument chosen by God. </p><p>And going out to the mother he did what she asked--laid his hand on the<br>boy's head and prayed. </p><p>The mother left with her son, and a month later the boy recovered, and<br>the fame of the holy healing power of the starets Sergius (as they now<br>called him) spread throughout the whole district. After that, not a week<br>passed without sick people coming, riding or on foot, to Father Sergius;<br>and having acceded to one petition he could not refuse others, and he<br>laid his hands on many and prayed. Many recovered, and his fame spread<br>more and more. </p><p>So seven years passed in the Monastery and thirteen in his hermit's<br>cell. He now had the appearance of an old man: his beard was long and<br>grey, but his hair, though thin, was still black and curly. </p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>V </p><p>For some weeks Father Sergius had been living with one persistent<br>thought: whether he was right in accepting the position in which he had<br>not so much placed himself as been placed by the Archimandrite and<br>the Abbot. That position had begun after the recovery of the<br>fourteen-year-old boy. From that time, with each month, week, and day<br>that passed, Sergius felt his own inner life wasting away and being<br>replaced by external life. It was as if he had been turned inside out. </p><p>Sergius saw that he was a means of attracting visitors and contributions<br>to the monastery, and that therefore the authorities arranged matters in<br>such a way as to make as much use of him as possible. For instance, they<br>rendered it impossible for him to do any manual work. He was supplied<br>with everything he could want, and they only demanded of him that he<br>should not refuse his blessing to those who came to seek it. For his<br>convenience they appointed days when he would receive. They arranged a<br>reception-room for men, and a place was railed in so that he should not<br>be pushed over by the crowds of women visitors, and so that he could<br>conveniently bless those who came. </p><p>They told him that people needed him, and that fulfilling Christ's law<br>of love he could not refuse their demand to see him, and that to avoid<br>them would be cruel. He could not but agree with this, but the more he<br>gave himself up to such a life the more he felt that what was internal<br>became external, and that the fount of living water within him dried<br>up, and that what he did now was done more and more for men and less and<br>less for God. </p><p>Whether he admonished people, or simply blessed them, or prayed for the<br>sick, or advised people about their lives, or listened to expressions of<br>gratitude from those he had helped by precepts, or alms, or healing (as<br>they assured him)--he could not help being pleased at it, and could not<br>be indifferent to the results of his activity and to the influence he<br>exerted. He thought himself a shining light, and the more he felt this<br>the more was he conscious of a weakening, a dying down of the divine<br>light of truth that shone within him. </p><p>'In how far is what I do for God and in how far is it for men?' That was<br>the question that insistently tormented him and to which he was not so<br>much unable to give himself an answer as unable to face the answer. </p><p>In the depth of his soul he felt that the devil had substituted an<br>activity for men in place of his former activity for God. He felt this<br>because, just as it had formerly been hard for him to be torn from his<br>solitude so now that solitude itself was hard for him. He was oppressed<br>and wearied by visitors, but at the bottom of his heart he was glad of<br>their presence and glad of the praise they heaped upon him. </p><p>There was a time when he decided to go away and hide. He even planned<br>all that was necessary for that purpose. He prepared for himself a<br>peasant's shirt, trousers, coat, and cap. He explained that he wanted<br>these to give to those who asked. And he kept these clothes in his cell,<br>planning how he would put them on, cut his hair short, and go away.<br>First he would go some three hundred versts by train, then he would<br>leave the train and walk from village to village. He asked an old man<br>who had been a soldier how he tramped: what people gave him, and what<br>shelter they allowed him. The soldier told him where people were most<br>charitable, and where they would take a wanderer in for the night, and<br>Father Sergius intended to avail himself of this information. He even<br>put on those clothes one night in his desire to go, but he could not<br>decide what was best--to remain or to escape. At first he was in doubt,<br>but afterwards this indecision passed. He submitted to custom and<br>yielded to the devil, and only the peasant garb reminded him of the<br>thought and feeling he had had. </p><p>Every day more and more people flocked to him and less and less time was<br>left him for prayer and for renewing his spiritual strength. Sometimes<br>in lucid moments he thought he was like a place where there had once<br>been a spring. 'There used to be a feeble spring of living water which<br>flowed quietly from me and through me. That was true life, the time when<br>she tempted me!' (He always thought with ecstasy of that night and of<br>her who was now Mother Agnes.) She had tasted of that pure water, but<br>since then there had not been time for it to collect before thirsty<br>people came crowding in and pushing one another aside. And they had<br>trampled everything down and nothing was left but mud. </p><p>So he thought in rare moments of lucidity, but his usual state of mind<br>was one of weariness and a tender pity for himself because of that<br>weariness. </p><p>It was in spring, on the eve of the mid-Pentecostal feast. Father<br>Sergius was officiating at the Vigil Service in his hermitage church,<br>where the congregation was as large as the little church could<br>hold--about twenty people. They were all well-to-do proprietors or<br>merchants. Father Sergius admitted anyone, but a selection was made by<br>the monk in attendance and by an assistant who was sent to the hermitage<br>every day from the monastery. A crowd of some eighty people--pilgrims<br>and peasants, and especially peasant-women--stood outside waiting for<br>Father Sergius to come out and bless them. Meanwhile he conducted<br>the service, but at the point at which he went out to the tomb of his<br>predecessor, he staggered and would have fallen had he not been caught<br>by a merchant standing behind him and by the monk acting as deacon. </p><p>'What is the matter, Father Sergius? Dear man! O Lord!' exclaimed the<br>women. 'He is as white as a sheet!' </p><p>But Father Sergius recovered immediately, and though very pale, he waved<br>the merchant and the deacon aside and continued to chant the service. </p><p>Father Seraphim, the deacon, the acolytes, and Sofya Ivanovna, a lady<br>who always lived near the hermitage and tended Father Sergius, begged<br>him to bring the service to an end. </p><p>'No, there's nothing the matter,' said Father Sergius, slightly smiling<br>from beneath his moustache and continuing the service. 'Yes, that is the<br>way the Saints behave!' thought he. </p><p>'A holy man--an angel of God!' he heard just then the voice of Sofya<br>Ivanovna behind him, and also of the merchant who had supported him.<br>He did not heed their entreaties, but went on with the service. Again<br>crowding together they all made their way by the narrow passages back<br>into the little church, and there, though abbreviating it slightly,<br>Father Sergius completed vespers. </p><p>Immediately after the service Father Sergius, having pronounced the<br>benediction on those present, went over to the bench under the elm tree<br>at the entrance to the cave. He wished to rest and breathe the fresh<br>air--he felt in need of it. But as soon as he left the church the crowd<br>of people rushed to him soliciting his blessing, his advice, and his<br>help. There were pilgrims who constantly tramped from one holy place to<br>another and from one starets to another, and were always entranced by<br>every shrine and every starets. Father Sergius knew this common, cold,<br>conventional, and most irreligious type. There were pilgrims, for<br>the most part discharged soldiers, unaccustomed to a settled life,<br>poverty-stricken, and many of them drunken old men, who tramped from<br>monastery to monastery merely to be fed. And there were rough peasants<br>and peasant-women who had come with their selfish requirements, seeking<br>cures or to have doubts about quite practical affairs solved for them:<br>about marrying off a daughter, or hiring a shop, or buying a bit<br>of land, or how to atone for having overlaid a child or having an<br>illegitimate one. </p><p>All this was an old story and not in the least interesting to him. He<br>knew he would hear nothing new from these folk, that they would arouse<br>no religious emotion in him; but he liked to see the crowd to which<br>his blessing and advice was necessary and precious, so while that crowd<br>oppressed him it also pleased him. Father Seraphim began to drive them<br>away, saying that Father Sergius was tired. </p><p>But Father Sergius, remembering the words of the Gospel: 'Forbid them'<br>(children) 'not to come unto me,' and feeling tenderly towards himself<br>at this recollection, said they should be allowed to approach. </p><p>He rose, went to the railing beyond which the crowd had gathered, and<br>began blessing them and answering their questions, but in a voice so<br>weak that he was touched with pity for himself. Yet despite his wish to<br>receive them all he could not do it. Things again grew dark before his<br>eyes, and he staggered and grasped the railings. He felt a rush of blood<br>to his head and first went pale and then suddenly flushed. </p><p>'I must leave the rest till to-morrow. I cannot do more to-day,'<br>and, pronouncing a general benediction, he returned to the bench. The<br>merchant again supported him, and leading him by the arm helped him to<br>be seated. </p><p>'Father!' came voices from the crowd. 'Dear Father! Do not forsake us.<br>Without you we are lost!' </p><p>The merchant, having seated Father Sergius on the bench under the elm,<br>took on himself police duties and drove the people off very resolutely.<br>It is true that he spoke in a low voice so that Father Sergius might not<br>hear him, but his words were incisive and angry. </p><p>'Be off, be off! He has blessed you, and what more do you want? Get<br>along with you, or I'll wring your necks! Move on there! Get along, you<br>old woman with your dirty leg-bands! Go, go! Where are you shoving to?<br>You've been told that it is finished. To-morrow will be as God wills,<br>but for to-day he has finished!' </p><p>'Father! Only let my eyes have a glimpse of his dear face!' said an old<br>woman. </p><p>'I'll glimpse you! Where are you shoving to?' </p><p>Father Sergius noticed that the merchant seemed to be acting roughly,<br>and in a feeble voice told the attendant that the people should not be<br>driven away. He knew that they would be driven away all the same, and<br>he much desired to be left alone and to rest, but he sent the attendant<br>with that message to produce an impression. </p><p>'All right, all right! I am not driving them away. I am only<br>remonstrating with them,' replied the merchant. 'You know they wouldn't<br>hesitate to drive a man to death. They have no pity, they only consider<br>themselves. . . . You've been told you cannot see him. Go away!<br>To-morrow!' And he got rid of them all. </p><p>He took all these pains because he liked order and liked to domineer<br>and drive the people away, but chiefly because he wanted to have Father<br>Sergius to himself. He was a widower with an only daughter who was an<br>invalid and unmarried, and whom he had brought fourteen hundred versts<br>to Father Sergius to be healed. For two years past he had been taking<br>her to different places to be cured: first to the university clinic in<br>the chief town of the province, but that did no good; then to a peasant<br>in the province of Samara, where she got a little better; then to a<br>doctor in Moscow to whom he paid much money, but this did no good at<br>all. Now he had been told that Father Sergius wrought cures, and had<br>brought her to him. So when all the people had been driven away he<br>approached Father Sergius, and suddenly falling on his knees loudly<br>exclaimed: </p><p>'Holy Father! Bless my afflicted offspring that she may be healed of her<br>malady. I venture to prostrate myself at your holy feet.' </p><p>And he placed one hand on the other, cup-wise. He said and did all this<br>as if he were doing something clearly and firmly appointed by law and<br>usage--as if one must and should ask for a daughter to be cured in just<br>this way and no other. He did it with such conviction that it seemed<br>even to Father Sergius that it should be said and done in just that way,<br>but nevertheless he bade him rise and tell him what the trouble was. The<br>merchant said that his daughter, a girl of twenty-two, had fallen ill<br>two years ago, after her mother's sudden death. She had moaned (as<br>he expressed it) and since then had not been herself. And now he had<br>brought her fourteen hundred versts and she was waiting in the hostelry<br>till Father Sergius should give orders to bring her. She did not go out<br>during the day, being afraid of the light, and could only come after<br>sunset. </p><p>'Is she very weak?' asked Father Sergius. </p><p>'No, she has no particular weakness. She is quite plump, and is only<br>"nerastenic" the doctors say. If you will only let me bring her this<br>evening, Father Sergius, I'll fly like a spirit to fetch her. Holy<br>Father! Revive a parent's heart, restore his line, save his afflicted<br>daughter by your prayers!' And the merchant again threw himself on his<br>knees and bending sideways, with his head resting on his clenched fists,<br>remained stock still. Father Sergius again told him to get up, and<br>thinking how heavy his activities were and how he went through with them<br>patiently notwithstanding, he sighed heavily and after a few seconds of<br>silence, said: </p><p>'Well, bring her this evening. I will pray for her, but now I am tired.<br>. . .' and he closed his eyes. 'I will send for you.' </p><p>The merchant went away, stepping on tiptoe, which only made his boots<br>creak the louder, and Father Sergius remained alone. </p><p>His whole life was filled by Church services and by people who came<br>to see him, but to-day had been a particularly difficult one. In<br>the morning an important official had arrived and had had a long<br>conversation with him; after that a lady had come with her son. This son<br>was a sceptical young professor whom the mother, an ardent believer and<br>devoted to Father Sergius, had brought that he might talk to him. The<br>conversation had been very trying. The young man, evidently not wishing<br>to have a controversy with a monk, had agreed with him in everything<br>as with someone who was mentally inferior. Father Sergius saw that the<br>young man did not believe but yet was satisfied, tranquil, and at ease,<br>and the memory of that conversation now disquieted him. </p><p>'Have something to eat, Father,' said the attendant. </p><p>'All right, bring me something.' </p><p>The attendant went to a hut that had been arranged some ten paces from<br>the cave, and Father Sergius remained alone. </p><p>The time was long past when he had lived alone doing everything for<br>himself and eating only rye-bread, or rolls prepared for the Church. He<br>had been advised long since that he had no right to neglect his health,<br>and he was given wholesome, though Lenten, food. He ate sparingly,<br>though much more than he had done, and often he ate with much pleasure,<br>and not as formerly with aversion and a sense of guilt. So it was now.<br>He had some gruel, drank a cup of tea, and ate half a white roll. </p><p>The attendant went away, and Father Sergius remained alone under the elm<br>tree. </p><p>It was a wonderful May evening, when the birches, aspens, elms, wild<br>cherries, and oaks, had just burst into foliage. </p><p>The bush of wild cherries behind the elm tree was in full bloom and had<br>not yet begun to shed its blossoms, and the nightingales--one quite near<br>at hand and two or three others in the bushes down by the river--burst<br>into full song after some preliminary twitters. From the river came the<br>far-off songs of peasants returning, no doubt, from their work. The sun<br>was setting behind the forest, its last rays glowing through the leaves.<br>All that side was brilliant green, the other side with the elm tree was<br>dark. The cockchafers flew clumsily about, falling to the ground when<br>they collided with anything. </p><p>After supper Father Sergius began to repeat a silent prayer: 'O Lord<br>Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon us!' and then he read a psalm,<br>and suddenly in the middle of the psalm a sparrow flew out from the<br>bush, alighted on the ground, and hopped towards him chirping as it<br>came, but then it took fright at something and flew away. He said a<br>prayer which referred to his abandonment of the world, and hastened to<br>finish it in order to send for the merchant with the sick daughter. She<br>interested him in that she presented a distraction, and because both she<br>and her father considered him a saint whose prayers were efficacious.<br>Outwardly he disavowed that idea, but in the depths of his soul he<br>considered it to be true. </p><p>He was often amazed that this had happened, that he, Stepan Kasatsky,<br>had come to be such an extraordinary saint and even a worker of<br>miracles, but of the fact that he was such there could not be the<br>least doubt. He could not fail to believe in the miracles he himself<br>witnessed, beginning with the sick boy and ending with the old woman who<br>had recovered her sight when he had prayed for her. </p><p>Strange as it might be, it was so. Accordingly the merchant's daughter<br>interested him as a new individual who had faith in him, and also as a<br>fresh opportunity to confirm his healing powers and enhance his fame.<br>'They bring people a thousand versts and write about it in the papers.<br>The Emperor knows of it, and they know of it in Europe, in unbelieving<br>Europe'--thought he. And suddenly he felt ashamed of his vanity and<br>again began to pray. 'Lord, King of Heaven, Comforter, Soul of Truth!<br>Come and enter into me and cleanse me from all sin and save and bless<br>my soul. Cleanse me from the sin of worldly vanity that troubles me!' he<br>repeated, and he remembered how often he had prayed about this and how<br>vain till now his prayers had been in that respect. His prayers worked<br>miracles for others, but in his own case God had not granted him<br>liberation from this petty passion. </p><p>He remembered his prayers at the commencement of his life at the<br>hermitage, when he prayed for purity, humility, and love, and how it<br>seemed to him then that God heard his prayers. He had retained his<br>purity and had chopped off his finger. And he lifted the shrivelled<br>stump of that finger to his lips and kissed it. It seemed to him now<br>that he had been humble then when he had always seemed loathsome to<br>himself on account of his sinfulness; and when he remembered the tender<br>feelings with which he had then met an old man who was bringing a<br>drunken soldier to him to ask alms; and how he had received HER, it<br>seemed to him that he had then possessed love also. But now? And he<br>asked himself whether he loved anyone, whether he loved Sofya Ivanovna,<br>or Father Seraphim, whether he had any feeling of love for all who had<br>come to him that day--for that learned young man with whom he had had<br>that instructive discussion in which he was concerned only to show off<br>his own intelligence and that he had not lagged behind the times in<br>knowledge. He wanted and needed their love, but felt none towards them.<br>He now had neither love nor humility nor purity. </p><p>He was pleased to know that the merchant's daughter was twenty-two, and<br>he wondered whether she was good-looking. When he inquired whether she<br>was weak, he really wanted to know if she had feminine charm. </p><p>'Can I have fallen so low?' he thought. 'Lord, help me! Restore me, my<br>Lord and God!' And he clasped his hands and began to pray. </p><p>The nightingales burst into song, a cockchafer knocked against him and<br>crept up the back of his neck. He brushed it off. 'But does He exist?<br>What if I am knocking at a door fastened from outside? The bar is on the<br>door for all to see. Nature--the nightingales and the cockchafers--is<br>that bar. Perhaps the young man was right.' And he began to pray aloud.<br>He prayed for a long time till these thoughts vanished and he again felt<br>calm and confident. He rang the bell and told the attendant to say that<br>the merchant might bring his daughter to him now. </p><p>The merchant came, leading his daughter by the arm. He led her into the<br>cell and immediately left her. </p><p>She was a very fair girl, plump and very short, with a pale, frightened,<br>childish face and a much developed feminine figure. Father Sergius<br>remained seated on the bench at the entrance and when she was passing<br>and stopped beside him for his blessing he was aghast at himself for<br>the way he looked at her figure. As she passed by him he was acutely<br>conscious of her femininity, though he saw by her face that she was<br>sensual and feeble-minded. He rose and went into the cell. She was<br>sitting on a stool waiting for him, and when he entered she rose. </p><p>'I want to go back to Papa,' she said. </p><p>'Don't be afraid,' he replied. 'What are you suffering from?' </p><p>'I am in pain all over,' she said, and suddenly her face lit up with a<br>smile. </p><p>'You will be well,' said he. 'Pray!' </p><p>'What is the use of praying? I have prayed and it does no good'--and she<br>continued to smile. 'I want you to pray for me and lay your hands on me.<br>I saw you in a dream.' </p><p>'How did you see me?' </p><p>'I saw you put your hands on my breast like that.' She took his hand and<br>pressed it to her breast. 'Just here.' </p><p>He yielded his right hand to her. </p><p>'What is your name?' he asked, trembling all over and feeling that he<br>was overcome and that his desire had already passed beyond control. </p><p>'Marie. Why?' </p><p>She took his hand and kissed it, and then put her arm round his waist<br>and pressed him to herself. </p><p>'What are you doing?' he said. 'Marie, you are a devil!' </p><p>'Oh, perhaps. What does it matter?' </p><p>And embracing him she sat down with him on the bed. </p><p>At dawn he went out into the porch. </p><p>'Can this all have happened? Her father will come and she will tell him<br>everything. She is a devil! What am I to do? Here is the axe with which<br>I chopped off my finger.' He snatched up the axe and moved back towards<br>the cell. </p><p>The attendant came up. </p><p>'Do you want some wood chopped? Let me have the axe.' </p><p>Sergius yielded up the axe and entered the cell. She was lying<br>there asleep. He looked at her with horror, and passed on beyond the<br>partition, where he took down the peasant clothes and put them on. Then<br>he seized a pair of scissors, cut off his long hair, and went out along<br>the path down the hill to the river, where he had not been for more than<br>three years. </p><p>A road ran beside the river and he went along it and walked till noon.<br>Then he went into a field of rye and lay down there. Towards evening<br>he approached a village, but without entering it went towards the cliff<br>that overhung the river. There he again lay down to rest. </p><p>It was early morning, half an hour before sunrise. All was damp and<br>gloomy and a cold early wind was blowing from the west. 'Yes, I must end<br>it all. There is no God. But how am I to end it? Throw myself into the<br>river? I can swim and should not drown. Hang myself? Yes, just throw<br>this sash over a branch.' This seemed so feasible and so easy that<br>he felt horrified. As usual at moments of despair he felt the need of<br>prayer. But there was no one to pray to. There was no God. He lay down<br>resting on his arm, and suddenly such a longing for sleep overcame him<br>that he could no longer support his head on his hand, but stretched out<br>his arm, laid his head upon it, and fell asleep. But that sleep lasted<br>only for a moment. He woke up immediately and began not to dream but to<br>remember. </p><p>He saw himself as a child in his mother's home in the country. A<br>carriage drives up, and out of it steps Uncle Nicholas Sergeevich,<br>with his long, spade-shaped, black beard, and with him Pashenka, a thin<br>little girl with large mild eyes and a timid pathetic face. And into<br>their company of boys Pashenka is brought and they have to play with<br>her, but it is dull. She is silly, and it ends by their making fun of<br>her and forcing her to show how she can swim. She lies down on the floor<br>and shows them, and they all laugh and make a fool of her. She sees this<br>and blushes red in patches and becomes more pitiable than before,<br>so pitiable that he feels ashamed and can never forget that crooked,<br>kindly, submissive smile. And Sergius remembered having seen her since<br>then. Long after, just before he became a monk, she had married a<br>landowner who squandered all her fortune and was in the habit of beating<br>her. She had had two children, a son and a daughter, but the son had<br>died while still young. And Sergius remembered having seen her very<br>wretched. Then again he had seen her in the monastery when she was a<br>widow. She had been still the same, not exactly stupid, but insipid,<br>insignificant, and pitiable. She had come with her daughter and her<br>daughter's fiance. They were already poor at that time and later on he<br>had heard that she was living in a small provincial town and was very<br>poor. </p><p>'Why am I thinking about her?' he asked himself, but he could not cease<br>doing so. 'Where is she? How is she getting on? Is she still as unhappy<br>as she was then when she had to show us how to swim on the floor? But<br>why should I think about her? What am I doing? I must put an end to<br>myself.' </p><p>And again he felt afraid, and again, to escape from that thought, he<br>went on thinking about Pashenka. </p><p>So he lay for a long time, thinking now of his unavoidable end and now<br>of Pashenka. She presented herself to him as a means of salvation. At<br>last he fell asleep, and in his sleep he saw an angel who came to him<br>and said: 'Go to Pashenka and learn from her what you have to do, what<br>your sin is, and wherein lies your salvation.' </p><p>He awoke, and having decided that this was a vision sent by God, he felt<br>glad, and resolved to do what had been told him in the vision. He knew<br>the town where she lived. It was some three hundred versts (two hundred<br>miles) away, and he set out to walk there. </p><p>&nbsp; </p><p>VI </p><p>Pashenka had already long ceased to be Pashenka and had become old,<br>withered, wrinkled Praskovya Mikhaylovna, mother-in-law of that failure,<br>the drunken official Mavrikyev. She was living in the country town<br>where he had had his last appointment, and there she was supporting the<br>family: her daughter, her ailing neurasthenic son-in-law, and her five<br>grandchildren. She did this by giving music lessons to tradesmen's<br>daughters, giving four and sometimes five lessons a day of an hour each,<br>and earning in this way some sixty rubles (6 pounds) a month. So they<br>lived for the present, in expectation of another appointment. She had<br>sent letters to all her relations and acquaintances asking them to<br>obtain a post for her son-in-law, and among the rest she had written to<br>Sergius, but that letter had not reached him. </p><p>It was a Saturday, and Praskovya Mikhaylovna was herself mixing dough<br>for currant bread such as the serf-cook on her father's estate used<br>to make so well. She wished to give her grandchildren a treat on the<br>Sunday. </p><p>Masha, her daughter, was nursing her youngest child, the eldest boy and<br>girl were at school, and her son-in-law was asleep, not having slept<br>during the night. Praskovya Mikhaylovna had remained awake too for a<br>great part of the night, trying to soften her daughter's anger against<br>her husband. </p><p>She saw that it was impossible for her son-in-law, a weak creature, to<br>be other than he was, and realized that his wife's reproaches could do<br>no good--so she used all her efforts to soften those reproaches and to<br>avoid recrimination and anger. Unkindly relations between people caused<br>her actual physical suffering. It was so clear to her that bitter<br>feelings do not make anything better, but only make everything worse.<br>She did not in fact think about this: she simply suffered at the sight<br>of anger as she would from a bad smell, a harsh noise, or from blows on<br>her body. </p><p>She had--with a feeling of self-satisfaction--just taught Lukerya how<br>to mix the dough, when her six-year-old grandson Misha, wearing an<br>apron and with darned stockings on his crooked little legs, ran into the<br>kitchen with a frightened face. </p><p>'Grandma, a dreadful old man wants to see you.' </p><p>Lukerya looked out at the door. </p><p>'There is a pilgrim of some kind, a man . . .' </p><p>Praskovya Mikhaylovna rubbed her thin elbows against one another, wiped<br>her hands on her apron and went upstairs to get a five-kopek piece<br>[about a penny] out of her purse for him, but remembering that she had<br>nothing less than a ten-kopek piece she decided to give him some bread<br>instead. She returned to the cupboard, but suddenly blushed at the<br>thought of having grudged the ten-kopek piece, and telling Lukerya to<br>cut a slice of bread, went upstairs again to fetch it. 'It serves you<br>right,' she said to herself. 'You must now give twice over.' </p><p>She gave both the bread and the money to the pilgrim, and when doing<br>so--far from being proud of her generosity--she excused herself for<br>giving so little. The man had such an imposing appearance. </p><p>Though he had tramped two hundred versts as a beggar, though he was<br>tattered and had grown thin and weatherbeaten, though he had cropped his<br>long hair and was wearing a peasant's cap and boots, and though he bowed<br>very humbly, Sergius still had the impressive appearance that made him<br>so attractive. But Praskovya Mikhaylovna did not recognize him. She<br>could hardly do so, not having seen him for almost twenty years. </p><p>'Don't think ill of me, Father. Perhaps you want something to eat?' </p><p>He took the bread and the money, and Praskovya Mikhaylovna was surprised<br>that he did not go, but stood looking at her. </p><p>'Pashenka, I have come to you! Take me in . . .' </p><p>His beautiful black eyes, shining with the tears that started in them,<br>were fixed on her with imploring insistence. And under his greyish<br>moustache his lips quivered piteously. </p><p>Praskovya Mikhaylovna pressed her hands to her withered breast, opened<br>her mouth, and stood petrified, staring at the pilgrim with dilated<br>eyes. </p><p>'It can't be! Stepa! Sergey! Father Sergius!' </p><p>'Yes, it is I,' said Sergius in a low voice. 'Only not Sergius, or<br>Father Sergius, but a great sinner, Stepan Kasatsky--a great and lost<br>sinner. Take me in and help me!' </p><p>'It's impossible! How have you so humbled yourself? But come in.' </p><p>She reached out her hand, but he did not take it and only followed her<br>in. </p><p>But where was she to take him? The lodging was a small one. Formerly<br>she had had a tiny room, almost a closet, for herself, but later she had<br>given it up to her daughter, and Masha was now sitting there rocking the<br>baby. </p><p>'Sit here for the present,' she said to Sergius, pointing to a bench in<br>the kitchen. </p><p>He sat down at once, and with an evidently accustomed movement slipped<br>the straps of his wallet first off one shoulder and then off the other. </p><p>'My God, my God! How you have humbled yourself, Father! Such great fame,<br>and now like this . . .' </p><p>Sergius did not reply, but only smiled meekly, placing his wallet under<br>the bench on which he sat. </p><p>'Masha, do you know who this is?'--And in a whisper Praskovya<br>Mikhaylovna told her daughter who he was, and together they then carried<br>the bed and the cradle out of the tiny room and cleared it for Sergius. </p><p>Praskovya Mikhaylovna led him into it. </p><p>'Here you can rest. Don't take offence . . . but I must go out.' </p><p>'Where to?' </p><p>'I have to go to a lesson. I am ashamed to tell you, but I teach music!' </p><p>'Music? But that is good. Only just one thing, Praskovya Mikhaylovna,<br>I have come to you with a definite object. When can I have a talk with<br>you?' </p><p>'I shall be very glad. Will this evening do?' </p><p>'Yes. But one thing more. Don't speak about me, or say who I am. I have<br>revealed myself only to you. No one knows where I have gone to. It must<br>be so.' </p><p>'Oh, but I have told my daughter.' </p><p>'Well, ask her not to mention it.' </p><p>And Sergius took off his boots, lay down, and at once fell asleep after<br>a sleepless night and a walk of nearly thirty miles. </p><p>When Praskovya Mikhaylovna returned, Sergius was sitting in the little<br>room waiting for her. He did not come out for dinner, but had some soup<br>and gruel which Lukerya brought him. </p><p>'How is it that you have come back earlier than you said?' asked<br>Sergius. 'Can I speak to you now?' </p><p>'How is it that I have the happiness to receive such a guest? I have<br>missed one of my lessons. That can wait . . . I had always been planning<br>to go to see you. I wrote to you, and now this good fortune has come.' </p><p>'Pashenka, please listen to what I am going to tell you as to a<br>confession made to God at my last hour. Pashenka, I am not a holy man,<br>I am not even as good as a simple ordinary man; I am a loathsome,<br>vile, and proud sinner who has gone astray, and who, if not worse than<br>everyone else, is at least worse than most very bad people.' </p><p>Pashenka looked at him at first with staring eyes. But she believed what<br>he said, and when she had quite grasped it she touched his hand, smiling<br>pityingly, and said: </p><p>'Perhaps you exaggerate, Stiva?' </p><p>'No, Pashenka. I am an adulterer, a murderer, a blasphemer, and a<br>deceiver.' </p><p>'My God! How is that?' exclaimed Praskovya Mikhaylovna. </p><p>'But I must go on living. And I, who thought I knew everything, who<br>taught others how to live--I know nothing and ask you to teach me.' </p><p>'What are you saying, Stiva? You are laughing at me. Why do you always<br>make fun of me?' </p><p>'Well, if you think I am jesting you must have it as you please. But<br>tell me all the same how you live, and how you have lived your life.' </p><p>'I? I have lived a very nasty, horrible life, and now God is punishing<br>me as I deserve. I live so wretchedly, so wretchedly . . .' </p><p>'How was it with your marriage? How did you live with your husband?' </p><p>'It was all bad. I married because I fell in love in the nastiest way.<br>Papa did not approve. But I would not listen to anything and just<br>got married. Then instead of helping my husband I tormented him by my<br>jealousy, which I could not restrain.' </p><p>'I heard that he drank . . .' </p><p>'Yes, but I did not give him any peace. I always reproached him, though<br>you know it is a disease! He could not refrain from it. I now remember<br>how I tried to prevent his having it, and the frightful scenes we had!' </p><p>And she looked at Kasatsky with beautiful eyes, suffering from the<br>remembrance. </p><p>Kasatsky remembered how he had been told that Pashenka's husband used<br>to beat her, and now, looking at her thin withered neck with prominent<br>veins behind her ears, and her scanty coil of hair, half grey half<br>auburn, he seemed to see just how it had occurred. </p><p>'Then I was left with two children and no means at all.' </p><p>'But you had an estate!' </p><p>'Oh, we sold that while Vasya was still alive, and the money was all<br>spent. We had to live, and like all our young ladies I did not know how<br>to earn anything. I was particularly useless and helpless. So we spent<br>all we had. I taught the children and improved my own education a<br>little. And then Mitya fell ill when he was already in the fourth<br>form, and God took him. Masha fell in love with Vanya, my son-in-law.<br>And--well, he is well-meaning but unfortunate. He is ill.' </p><p>'Mamma!'--her daughter's voice interrupted her--'Take Mitya! I can't be<br>in two places at once.' </p><p>Praskovya Mikhaylovna shuddered, but rose and went out of the room,<br>stepping quickly in her patched shoes. She soon came back with a boy of<br>two in her arms, who threw himself backwards and grabbed at her shawl<br>with his little hands. </p><p>'Where was I? Oh yes, he had a good appointment here, and his chief<br>was a kind man too. But Vanya could not go on, and had to give up his<br>position.' </p><p>'What is the matter with him?' </p><p>'Neurasthenia--it is a dreadful complaint. We consulted a doctor, who<br>told us he ought to go away, but we had no means. . . . I always hope it<br>will pass of itself. He has no particular pain, but . . .' </p><p>'Lukerya!' cried an angry and feeble voice. 'She is always sent away<br>when I want her. Mamma . . .' </p><p>'I'm coming!' Praskovya Mikhaylovna again interrupted herself. 'He has<br>not had his dinner yet. He can't eat with us.' </p><p>She went out and arranged something, and came back wiping her thin dark<br>hands. </p><p>'So that is how I live. I always complain and am always dissatisfied,<br>but thank God the grandchildren are all nice and healthy, and we can<br>still live. But why talk about me?' </p><p>'But what do you live on?' </p><p>'Well, I earn a little. How I used to dislike music, but how useful it<br>is to me now!' Her small hand lay on the chest of drawers beside which<br>she was sitting, and she drummed an exercise with her thin fingers. </p><p>'How much do you get for a lesson?' </p><p>'Sometimes a ruble, sometimes fifty kopeks, or sometimes thirty. They<br>are all so kind to me.' </p><p>'And do your pupils get on well?' asked Kasatsky with a slight smile. </p><p>Praskovya Mikhaylovna did not at first believe that he was asking<br>seriously, and looked inquiringly into his eyes. </p><p>'Some of them do. One of them is a splendid girl--the butcher's<br>daughter--such a good kind girl! If I were a clever woman I ought, of<br>course, with the connexions Papa had, to be able to get an appointment<br>for my son-in-law. But as it is I have not been able to do anything, and<br>have brought them all to this--as you see.' </p><p>'Yes, yes,' said Kasatsky, lowering his head. 'And how is it,<br>Pashenka--do you take part in Church life?' </p><p>'Oh, don't speak of it. I am so bad that way, and have neglected it so!<br>I keep the fasts with the children and sometimes go to church, and then<br>again sometimes I don't go for months. I only send the children.' </p><p>'But why don't you go yourself?' </p><p>'To tell the truth' (she blushed) 'I am ashamed, for my daughter's<br>sake and the children's, to go there in tattered clothes, and I haven't<br>anything else. Besides, I am just lazy.' </p><p>'And do you pray at home?' </p><p>'I do. But what sort of prayer is it? Only mechanical. I know it should<br>not be like that, but I lack real religious feeling. The only thing is<br>that I know how bad I am . . .' </p><p>'Yes, yes, that's right!' said Kasatsky, as if approvingly. </p><p>'I'm coming! I'm coming!' she replied to a call from her son-in-law, and<br>tidying her scanty plait she left the room. </p><p>But this time it was long before she returned. When she came back,<br>Kasatsky was sitting in the same position, his elbows resting on his<br>knees and his head bowed. But his wallet was strapped on his back. </p><p>When she came in, carrying a small tin lamp without a shade, he raised<br>his fine weary eyes and sighed very deeply. </p><p>'I did not tell them who you are,' she began timidly. 'I only said that<br>you are a pilgrim, a nobleman, and that I used to know you. Come into<br>the dining-room for tea.' </p><p>'No . . .' </p><p>'Well then, I'll bring some to you here.' </p><p>'No, I don't want anything. God bless you, Pashenka! I am going now. If<br>you pity me, don't tell anyone that you have seen me. For the love of<br>God don't tell anyone. Thank you. I would bow to your feet but I know<br>it would make you feel awkward. Thank you, and forgive me for Christ's<br>sake!' </p><p>'Give me your blessing.' </p><p>'God bless you! Forgive me for Christ's sake!' </p><p>He rose, but she would not let him go until she had given him bread and<br>butter and rusks. He took it all and went away. </p><p>It was dark, and before he had passed the second house he was lost to<br>sight. She only knew he was there because the dog at the priest's house<br>was barking. </p><p>'So that is what my dream meant! Pashenka is what I ought to have been<br>but failed to be. I lived for men on the pretext of living for God,<br>while she lived for God imagining that she lives for men. Yes, one good<br>deed--a cup of water given without thought of reward--is worth more<br>than any benefit I imagined I was bestowing on people. But after all was<br>there not some share of sincere desire to serve God?' he asked himself,<br>and the answer was: 'Yes, there was, but it was all soiled and overgrown<br>by desire for human praise. Yes, there is no God for the man who lives,<br>as I did, for human praise. I will now seek Him!' </p><p>And he walked from village to village as he had done on his way to<br>Pashenka, meeting and parting from other pilgrims, men and women, and<br>asking for bread and a night's rest in Christ's name. Occasionally some<br>angry housewife scolded him, or a drunken peasant reviled him, but for<br>the most part he was given food and drink and even something to take<br>with him. His noble bearing disposed some people in his favour, while<br>others on the contrary seemed pleased at the sight of a gentleman who<br>had come to beggary. </p><p>But his gentleness prevailed with everyone. </p><p>Often, finding a copy of the Gospels in a hut he would read it aloud,<br>and when they heard him the people were always touched and surprised, as<br>at something new yet familiar. </p><p>When he succeeded in helping people, either by advice, or by his<br>knowledge of reading and writing, or by settling some quarrel, he did<br>not wait to see their gratitude but went away directly afterwards. And<br>little by little God began to reveal Himself within him. </p><p>Once he was walking along with two old women and a soldier. They were<br>stopped by a party consisting of a lady and gentleman in a gig and<br>another lady and gentleman on horseback. The husband was on horseback<br>with his daughter, while in the gig his wife was driving with a<br>Frenchman, evidently a traveller. </p><p>The party stopped to let the Frenchman see the pilgrims who, in accord<br>with a popular Russian superstition, tramped about from place to place<br>instead of working. </p><p>They spoke French, thinking that the others would not understand them. </p><p>'Demandez-leur,' said the Frenchman, 's'ils sont bien sur de ce que leur<br>pelerinage est agreable a Dieu.' </p><p>The question was asked, and one old woman replied: </p><p>'As God takes it. Our feet have reached the holy places, but our hearts<br>may not have done so.' </p><p>They asked the soldier. He said that he was alone in the world and had<br>nowhere else to go. </p><p>They asked Kasatsky who he was. </p><p>'A servant of God.' </p><p>'Qu'est-ce qu'il dit? Il ne repond pas.' </p><p>'Il dit qu'il est un serviteur de Dieu. Cela doit etre un fils de<br>preetre. Il a de la race. Avez-vous de la petite monnaie?' </p><p>The Frenchman found some small change and gave twenty kopeks to each of<br>the pilgrims. </p><p>'Mais dites-leur que ce n'est pas pour les cierges que je leur donne,<br>mais pour qu'ils se regalent de the. Chay, chay pour vous, mon vieux!'<br>he said with a smile. And he patted Kasatsky on the shoulder with his<br>gloved hand. </p><p>'May Christ bless you,' replied Kasatsky without replacing his cap and<br>bowing his bald head. </p><p>He rejoiced particularly at this meeting, because he had disregarded the<br>opinion of men and had done the simplest, easiest thing--humbly accepted<br>twenty kopeks and given them to his comrade, a blind beggar. The less<br>importance he attached to the opinion of men the more did he feel the<br>presence of God within him. </p><p>For eight months Kasatsky tramped on in this manner, and in the ninth<br>month he was arrested for not having a passport. This happened at a<br>night-refuge in a provincial town where he had passed the night with<br>some pilgrims. He was taken to the police-station, and when asked who he<br>was and where was his passport, he replied that he had no passport and<br>that he was a servant of God. He was classed as a tramp, sentenced, and<br>sent to live in Siberia. </p><p>In Siberia he has settled down as the hired man of a well-to-do peasant,<br>in which capacity he works in the kitchen-garden, teaches children, and<br>attends to the sick. </p><p></p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, O beloved voices, upon which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours passionately call because erelong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye brake off in the middle of that song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sang together softly, to enrich
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor world with the sense of love, and witch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart out of things evil, I am strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing ye are not lost for aye among

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills, with last year's thrush. God keeps a niche
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Heaven to hold our idols; and albeit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brake them to our faces and denied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That our close kisses should impair their white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we shall behold them raised, complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust swept from their beauty, glorified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Memnons singing in the great God-light.
</pre>

<p> If I were only a little puppy, not your baby, mother dear, would you say "No" to me if I tried to eat from your dish?<br> Would you drive me off, saying to me, "Get away, you naughty little puppy?"<br> Then go, mother, go! I will never come to you when you call me, and never let you feed me any more.<br> If I were only a little green parrot, and not your baby, mother dear, would you keep me chained lest I should fly away?<br> Would you shake your finger at me and say, "What an ungrateful wretch of a bird! It is gnawing at its chain day and night?"<br> Then, go, mother, go! I will run away into the woods; I will never let you take me in your arms again.</p>

"I guess you were right, Linus. I shouldn't have picked this 
little tree," said Charlie Brown. "Everything I do turns into 
a disaster. I guess I don't really know what Christmas is 
all about. Isn't there anyone who knows what Christmas 
is all about?"

"Sure, Charlie Brown, I can tell you what Christmas is all about," 
said Linus. [<i>Linus walks to center stage</i>.] 

"Lights, please."

<i>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding 
in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them,
and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: 
and they were sore afraid.

And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, 
I bring you good tidings of great joy, 
which shall be to all people.

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
which is Christ the Lord.

And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
heavenly host praising God, and saying,

Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, 
good will toward men.</i>

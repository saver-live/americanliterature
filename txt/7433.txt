<p>Published in 1883, Robert Louis Stevenson's <cite class="al-title">Treasure Island</cite> is a rollicking tale of buccaneers, buried treasures, and adventure on the high seas--a legacy that inspired modern movies like the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series. It's the story of Jim Hawkins, the young son of the owners of the Admiral Benbow Inn. An old drunken seaman named Billy Bones arrives and becomes a long-term boarder at the inn, clearly in hiding. Bones confesses that he was once the mate of a notorious late pirate, Captain Flint, and that his old crew mates want Bones' sea chest. The pirates attack the inn to retrieve the chest, Jim makes off with a mysterious oil-skin pouch from the chest, which he shows to Dr. Livesey. He, Squire Trelawney and Jim Hawkins commission a sailing vessel to sail the high seas, armed with a detailed map of an island with the location of Flint's buried treasure. High sea adventures earn Jim his sea legs, and then some.</p><p>Featured in our collection of <a href="/books-for-young-readers">Books for Young Readers</a>.</p><p><img alt="Treasure Island, Jim Hawkins, Dreamer, 1883" title="Treasure Island, Jim Hawkins, Dreamer, 1883" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/treasure-island-dream.jpg" style="max-width:300px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1766986176" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p><p><a href="part-one-the-old-buccaneer-chapter-1-the-old-sea-dog-at-the-admiral-benbow">Part One: The Old Buccaneer -

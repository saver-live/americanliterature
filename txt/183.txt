<p>A Wolf had stolen a Lamb and was carrying it off to his lair to eat it. But his plans were very much changed when he met a Lion, who, without making any excuses, took the Lamb away from him.</p><p>The Wolf made off to a safe distance, and then said in a much injured tone:</p><p>"You have no right to take my property like that!"</p><p>The Lion looked back, but as the Wolf was too far away to be taught a lesson without too much inconvenience, he said:</p><p>"Your property? Did you buy it, or did the Shepherd make you a gift of it? Pray tell me, how did you get it?"</p><p class="center"><i>What is evil won is evil lost.</i></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p>

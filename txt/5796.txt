<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panting City cried to the Sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am faint with heat,--O breathe on me!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Sea said, "Lo, I breathe! but my breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some will be life, to others death!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Prometheus, bringing ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pain, come the Oceanides,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to the City, hot with the flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the pitiless sun, the east wind came.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came from the heaving breast of the deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent as dreams are, and sudden as sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life-giving, death-giving, which will it be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O breath of the merciful, merciless Sea?

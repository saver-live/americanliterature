<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell to barn and stack and tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to Severn shore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terence, look your last at me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I come home no more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sun burns on the half-mown hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now the blood is dried;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Maurice amongst the hay lies still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my knife is in his side."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother thinks us long away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis time the field were mown.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had two sons at rising day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-night she'll be alone."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And here's a bloody hand to shake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, man, here's good-bye;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll sweat no more on scythe and rake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bloody hands and I."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you strength to bring you pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a love to keep you clean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I wish you luck, come Lammastide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At racing on the green."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long for me the rick will wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long will wait the fold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long will stand the empty plate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dinner will be cold."
</pre>

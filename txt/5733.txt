<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful valley! through whose verdant meads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unheard the Garigliano glides along;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liris, nurse of rushes and of reeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river taciturn of classic song.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land of Labor and the Land of Rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where mediaeval towns are white on all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hillsides, and where every mountain's crest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is an Etrurian or a Roman wall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is Alagna, where Pope Boniface
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was dragged with contumely from his throne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sciarra Colonna, was that day's disgrace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pontiff's only, or in part thine own?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is Ceprano, where a renegade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was each Apulian, as great Dante saith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Manfred by his men-at-arms betrayed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spurred on to Benevento and to death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is Aquinum, the old Volscian town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Juvenal was born, whose lurid light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still hovers o'er his birthplace like the crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of splendor seen o'er cities in the night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubled the splendor is, that in its streets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angelic Doctor as a school-boy played,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreamed perhaps the dreams, that he repeats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ponderous folios for scholastics made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, uplifted, like a passing cloud

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pauses on a mountain summit high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monte Cassino's convent rears its proud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And venerable walls against the sky.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I remember how on foot I climbed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stony pathway leading to its gate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, the convent bells for vespers chimed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below, the darkening town grew desolate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I remember the low arch and dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court-yard with its well, the terrace wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which, far down, the valley like a park
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veiled in the evening mists, was dim descried.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day was dying, and with feeble hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caressed the mountain-tops; the vales between
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkened; the river in the meadowlands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheathed itself as a sword, and was not seen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence of the place was like a sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So full of rest it seemed; each passing tread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a reverberation from the deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recesses of the ages that are dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, more than thirteen centuries ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict fleeing from the gates of Rome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth disgusted with its vice and woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought in these mountain solitudes a home.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He founded here his Convent and his Rule
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of prayer and work, and counted work as prayer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pen became a clarion, and his school
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flamed like a beacon in the midnight air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What though Boccaccio, in his reckless way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mocking the lazy brotherhood, deplores
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illuminated manuscripts, that lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torn and neglected on the dusty floors?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boccaccio was a novelist, a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fancy and of fiction at the best!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This the urbane librarian said, and smiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incredulous, as at some idle jest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon such themes as these, with one young friar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat conversing late into the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in its cavernous chimney the woodfire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had burnt its heart out like an anchorite.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then translated, in my convent cell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself yet not myself, in dreams I lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as a monk who hears the matin bell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started from sleep; already it was day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the high window I beheld the scene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which Saint Benedict so oft had gazed,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the valley in the sheen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bright sun,--and stood as one amazed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray mists were rolling, rising, vanishing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woodlands glistened with their jewelled crowns;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off the mellow bells began to ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For matins in the half-awakened towns.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conflict of the Present and the Past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal and the actual in our life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on a field of battle held me fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where this world and the next world were at strife.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, as the valley from its sleep awoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the iron horses of the steam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toss to the morning air their plumes of smoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And woke, as one awaketh from a dream.

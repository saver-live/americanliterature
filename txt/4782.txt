&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like as the Oak whose roots descend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through earth and stillness seeking food
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most apt to furnish in the end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dense, indomitable wood

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, felled, may arm a seaward flank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Ostias mole or, bent to frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beaked Liburnians triple bank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carry afar the Roman name;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But which, a tree, the season moves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through gentler Gods than Wind or Tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delightedly to harbour doves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or take some clasping vine for bride;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this man, prescient to ensure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Since even now his orders hold)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little State might ride secure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sea from foes her sloth made bold,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned in his midmost harried round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Venus drove or Liber led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And snatched from any shrine he found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stolen Draught, the Secret Bread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor these alone. His life betrayed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No gust unslaked, no pleasure missed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the obedient Nine to aid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The varied chase. And Clio kissed;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bidding him write each sordid love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shame, panic, stratagem, and lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In full, that sinners undiscov-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ered, like ourselves, might say: Tis I!

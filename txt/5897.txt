<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LADY WENTWORTH.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred years ago, and something more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Queen Street, Portsmouth, at her tavern door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neat as a pin, and blooming as a rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood Mistress Stavers in her furbelows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as her cuckoo-clock was striking nine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above her head, resplendent on the sign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portrait of the Earl of Halifax,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In scarlet coat and periwig of flax,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveyed at leisure all her varied charms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cap, her bodice, her white folded arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half resolved, though he was past his prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rather damaged by the lapse of time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fall down at her feet and to declare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passion that had driven him to despair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For from his lofty station he had seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stavers, her husband, dressed in bottle-green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive his new Flying Stage-coach, four in hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the long lane, and out into the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knew that he was far upon the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Ipswich and to Boston on the Bay!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then the meditations of the Earl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were interrupted by a little girl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barefooted, ragged, with neglected hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes full of laughter, neck and shoulders bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thin slip of a girl, like a new moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure to be rounded into beauty soon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature men would worship and adore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though now in mean habiliments she bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pail of water, dripping, through the street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bathing, as she went her naked feet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pretty picture, full of grace,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender form, the delicate, thin face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swaying motion, as she hurried by;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shining feet, the laughter in her eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That o'er her face in ripples gleamed and glanced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in her pail the shifting sunbeam danced:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with uncommon feelings of delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Halifax beheld the sight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so Dame Stavers, for he heard her say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words, or thought he did, as plain as day:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Martha Hilton!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fie! how dare you go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the town half dressed, and looking so!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which the gypsy laughed, and straight replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter how I look; I yet shall ride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own chariot, ma'am."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Halifax benignly smiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with her heavy burden she passed on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked back, then turned the corner, and was gone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What next, upon that memorable day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrested his attention was a gay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brilliant equipage, that flashed and spun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver harness glittering in the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outriders with red jackets, lithe and lank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pounding the saddles as they rose and sank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all alone within the chariot sat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portly person with three-cornered hat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crimson velvet coat, head high in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold-headed cane, and nicely powdered hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And diamond buckles sparkling at his knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dignified, stately, florid, much at ease.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward the pageant swept, and as it passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Mistress Stavers courtesied low and fast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this was Governor Wentworth, driving down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Little Harbor, just beyond the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where his Great House stood looking out to sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A goodly place, where it was good to be.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasant mansion, an abode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near and yet hidden from the great high-road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequestered among trees, a noble pile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baronial and colonial in its style;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gables and dormer-windows everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stacks of chimneys rising high in air,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pandaean pipes, on which all winds that blew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made mournful music the whole winter through.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within, unwonted splendors met the eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panels, and floors of oak, and tapestry;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carved chimney-pieces, where on brazen dogs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revelled and roared the Christmas fires of logs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doors opening into darkness unawares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious passages, and flights of stairs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the walls, in heavy gilded frames,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancestral Wentworths with Old-Scripture names.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the mansion where the great man dwelt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A widower and childless; and he felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loneliness, the uncongenial gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like a presence haunted ever room;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For though not given to weakness, he could feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of wounds, that ache because they heal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years came and the years went,--seven in all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed in cloud and sunshine o'er the Hall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawns their splendor through its chambers shed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunsets flushed its western windows red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow was on its roofs, the wind, the rain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its woodlands were in leaf and bare again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moons waxed and waned, the lilacs bloomed and died,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the broad river ebbed and flowed the tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ships went to sea, and ships came home from sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the slow years sailed by and ceased to be.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all these years had Martha Hilton served
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Great House, not wholly unobserved:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By day, by night, the silver crescent grew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though hidden by clouds, her light still shining through;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid of all work, whether coarse or fine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A servant who made service seem divine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through her each room was fair to look upon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirrors glistened, and the brasses shone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very knocker on the outer door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she but passed, was brighter than before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the ceaseless turning of the mill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Time, that never for an hour stands still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ground out the Governor's sixtieth birthday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And powdered his brown hair with silver-gray.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robin, the forerunner of the spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bluebird with his jocund carolling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restless swallows building in the eaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden buttercups, the grass, the leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lilacs tossing in the winds of May,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All welcomed this majestic holiday!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave a splendid banquet served on plate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as became the Governor of the State,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who represented England and the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was magnificent in everything.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had invited all his friends and peers,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pepperels, the Langdons, and the Lears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sparhawks, the Penhallows, and the rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For why repeat the name of every guest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must mention one, in bands and gown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rector there, the Reverend Arthur Brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Established Church; with smiling face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat beside the Governor and said grace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the feast went on, as others do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ended as none other I e'er knew.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they had drunk the King, with many a cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor whispered in a servant's ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who disappeared and presently there stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the room, in perfect womanhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maiden, modest and yet self-possessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youthful and beautiful, and simply dressed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can this be Martha Hilton?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Martha Hilton, and no other she!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dowered with the beauty of her twenty years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How ladylike, how queenlike she appears;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale, thin crescent of the days gone by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Dian now in all her majesty!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet scarce a guest perceived that she was there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Governor, rising from his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played slightly with his ruffles, then looked down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said unto the Reverend Arthur Brown:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my birthday: it shall likewise be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wedding-day; and you shall marry me!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The listening guests were greatly mystified,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None more so than the rector, who replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marry you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that were a pleasant task,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Excellency; but to whom? I ask."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor answered: "To this lady here"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beckoned Martha Hilton to draw near.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came and stood, all blushes, at his side.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rector paused.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impatient Governor cried:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the lady; do you hesitate?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I command you as Chief Magistrate."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rector read the service loud and clear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so on to the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his command
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth finger of her fair left hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor placed the ring; and that was all:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha was Lady Wentworth of the Hall!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well pleased the audience heard the tale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian said: "Indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To praise you there is little need;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One almost hears the farmers flail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thresh out your wheat, nor does there fail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain freshness, as you said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweetness as of home-made bread.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not less sweet and not less fresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are many legends that I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ by the monks of long-ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved to mortify the flesh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the soul might purer grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rise to a diviner state;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of these--perhaps of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most beautiful--I now recall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with permission will narrate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping thereby to make amends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that grim tragedy of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As strong and black as Spanish wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told last night, and wish almost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had remained untold, my friends;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Torquemada's awful ghost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to me in the dreams I dreamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the darkness glared and gleamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a great lighthouse on the coast."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student laughing said: "Far more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to some dismal fire of bale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flaring portentous on a hill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or torches lighted on a shore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By wreckers in a midnight gale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter; be it as you will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only go forward with your tale."

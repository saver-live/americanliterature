<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCANDERBEG

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is fought and won
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By King Ladislaus the Hun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fire of hell and death's frost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of Pentecost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in rout before his path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the field of battle red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flee all that are not dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the army of Amurath.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iskander, the pride and boast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that mighty Othman host,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his routed Turks, takes flight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the battle fought and lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of Pentecost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving behind him dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Amurath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vanguard as it led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rearguard as it fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mown down in the bloody swath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the battle's aftermath.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he cared not for Hospodars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor for Baron or Voivode,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on through the night he rode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gazed at the fateful stars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That were shining overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But smote his steed with his staff,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled to himself, and said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the time to laugh."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a halt of the hurrying flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came a Scribe of the King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing his signet ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said in a voice severe:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first dark blot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thy name, George Castriot!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas why art thou here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the army of Amurath slain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left on the battle plain?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iskander answered and said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They lie on the bloody sod
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the hoofs of horses trod;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this was the decree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the watchers overhead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the war belongeth to God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in battle who are we,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are we, that shall withstand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of his lifted hand?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he bade them bind with chains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man of books and brains;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Scribe said: "What misdeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I done, that, without need,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou doest to me this thing?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iskander answering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said unto him: "Not one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misdeed to me hast thou done;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for fear that thou shouldst run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hide thyself from me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I done this unto thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now write me a writing, O Scribe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a blessing be on thy tribe!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A writing sealed with thy ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To King Amurath's Pasha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Croia,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city moated and walled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he surrender the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of my master, the King;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what is writ in his name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can never be recalled."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Scribe bowed low in dread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unto Iskander said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allah is great and just,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are as ashes and dust;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall I do this thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I know that my guilty head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be forfeit to the King?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then swift as a shooting star
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curved and shining blade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Iskander's scimetar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its sheath, with jewels bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot, as he thundered: "Write!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trembling Scribe obeyed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrote in the fitful glare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bivouac fire apart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the chill of the midnight air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his forehead white and bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chill of death in his heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again Iskander cried:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now follow whither I ride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For here thou must not stay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt be as my dearest friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And honors without end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall surround thee on every side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And attend thee night and day."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sullen Scribe replied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our pathways here divide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine leadeth not thy way."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even as he spoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell a sudden scimetar-stroke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When no one else was near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Scribe sank to the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a stone, pushed from the brink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a black pool, might sink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sob and disappear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no one saw the deed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the stillness around
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound was heard but the sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the hoofs of Iskander's steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As forward he sprang with a bound.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then onward he rode and afar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With scarce three hundred men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through river and forest and fen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the mountains of Argentar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heart was merry within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he crossed the river Drin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw in the gleam of the morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Castle Ak-Hissar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city Croia called,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city moated and walled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city where he was born,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above it the morning star.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his trumpeters in the van
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their silver bugles blew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in crowds about him ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albanian and Turkoman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sound together drew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he feasted with his friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they were warm with wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "O friends of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold what fortune sends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what the fates design!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Amurath commands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my father's wide domain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city and all its lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be given to me again."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the Castle White
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rode in regal state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And entered in at the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all his arms bedight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave to the Pasha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who ruled in Croia
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writing of the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sealed with his signet ring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Pasha bowed his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after a silence said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allah is just and great!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I yield to the will divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city and lands are thine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall contend with fate?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon from the castle walls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crescent banner falls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the crowd beholds instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a portent in the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iskander's banner fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Eagle with double head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a shout ascends on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For men's souls are tired of the Turks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their wicked ways and works,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have made of Ak-Hissar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city of the plague;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the loud, exultant cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That echoes wide and far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is: "Long live Scanderbeg!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thus Iskander came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more unto his own;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tidings, like the flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a conflagration blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the winds of summer, ran,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the land was in a blaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cities far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sayeth Ben Joshua Ben Meir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Book of the Words of the Days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Were taken as a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would take the tip of his ear."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now that is after my own heart,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet cried; "one understands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your swarthy hero Scanderbeg,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gauntlet on hand and boot on leg,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And skilled in every warlike art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding through his Albanian lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And following the auspicious star
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shone for him o'er Ak-Hissar."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian added here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His word of praise not less sincere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he ended with a jibe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hero of romance and song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was born," he said, "to right the wrong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I approve; but all the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bit of treason with the Scribe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adds nothing to your hero's fame."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student praised the good old times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And liked the canter of the rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had a hoofbeat in their sound;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But longed some further word to hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the old chronicler Ben Meir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where his volume might he found.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall Musician walked the room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With folded arms and gleaming eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he saw the Vikings rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gigantic shadows in the gloom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And much he talked of their emprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meteors seen in Northern skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Heimdal's horn, and day of doom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Sicilian laughed again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the time to laugh," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the whole story he well knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was an invention of the Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spun from the cobwebs in his brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the same bright scarlet thread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was the Tale of Kambalu.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Landlord spake no word;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was doubtful whether he had heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tale at all, so full of care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was he of his impending fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, like the sword of Damocles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above his head hung blank and bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspended by a single hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that he could not sit at ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sighed and looked disconsolate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shifted restless in his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolving how he might evade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blow of the descending blade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student came to his relief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By saying in his easy way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Musician: "Calm your grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fair Apollo of the North,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balder the Beautiful and so forth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although your magic lyre or lute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With broken strings is lying mute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still you can tell some doleful tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shipwreck in a midnight gale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or something of the kind to suit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood that we are in to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what is marvellous and strange;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So give your nimble fancy range,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we will follow in its flight."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Musician shook his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No tale I tell to-night," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While my poor instrument lies there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as a child with vacant stare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies in its little coffin dead."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, being urged, he said at last:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There comes to me out of the Past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice, whose tones are sweet and wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing a song almost divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a tear in every line;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ancient ballad, that my nurse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang to me when I was a child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accents tender as the verse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes wept, and sometimes smiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While singing it, to see arise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of wonder in my eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel my heart with tenor beat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple ballad I retain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly imprinted on my brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a tale will now repeat"

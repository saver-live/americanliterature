<p> When George Washington was quite a little boy, his father gave him a hatchet. It was bright and new, and George took great delight in going about and chopping things with it. </p><p> He ran into the garden, and there he saw a tree which seemed to say to him, "Come and cut me down!" </p><p> George had often seen his father's men chop down the great trees in the forest, and he thought that it would be fine sport to see this tree fall with a crash to the ground. So he set to work with his little hatchet, and, as the tree was a very small one, it did not take long to lay it low. </p><p> </p><p> Soon after that, his father came home. </p><p> "Who has been cutting my fine young cherry tree?" he cried. "It was the only tree of its kind in this country, and it cost me a great deal of money." </p><p> He was very angry when he came into the house. </p><p> "If I only knew who killed that cherry tree," he cried, "I would--yes, I would"-- </p><p> "Father!" cried little George. "I will tell you the truth about it. I chopped the tree down with my hatchet." </p><p> His father forgot his anger. </p><p> "George," he said, and he took the little fellow in his arms, "George, I am glad that you told me about it. I would rather lose a dozen cherry trees than that you should tell one false-hood." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

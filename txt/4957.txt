<pre>Long years ago, ere R--lls or R--ce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trebled the mileage man could cover;
When Sh--nks's Mare was H--bs--n's Choice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bl--r--ot had not flown to Dover:
When good hoteliers looked askance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any power save horse-flesh drew vans,
'Time was in easy, hand-made France,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met the Cure of Saint Juvans.

He was no babbler, but, at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One learned from things he left unspoken
How in some fiery, far-off past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His, and a woman's, heart were broken.
He sought for death, but found it not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, seeking, found his true vocation,
And fifty years, by all forgot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toiled at a simple folk's salvation.

His pay was lower than our Dole;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piteous little church he tended
Had neither roof nor vestments whole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save what his own hard fingers mended:
While, any hour, at every need
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As Conscience or La Grippe assailed 'em),
His parish bade him come with speed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, foot or cart, he never failed 'em,

His speech--to suit his hearers--ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From pure Parisian to gross peasant,
With interludes North African
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any Legionnaire were present:
And when some wine-ripe atheist mocked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His office or the Faith he knelt in,
He left the sinner dumb and shocked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By oaths his old Battalion dealt in.

And he was learned in Death and Life;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was Logic's self (as France is).
He knew his flock-man, maid, and wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their forebears, failings, and finances.
Spite, Avarice, Devotion, Lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passion ablaze or sick Obsession,
He dealt with each physician-wise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stern or most tender, at Confession...

To-day? God knows where he may lie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Cross of weathered beads above him:
But one not worthy to untie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shoe-string, prays you read--and love him!

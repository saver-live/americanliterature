<pre>As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree
The Angel of the Earth came down, and offered Earth in fee;
 But Adam did not need it,
 Nor the plough he would not speed it,
 Singing: "Earth and Water, Air and Fire,
 What more can mortal man desire?"
 (The Apple Tree's in bud)

As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree
The Angel of the Waters offered all the Seas in fee;
 But Adam would not take 'em,
 Nor the ships he wouldn't make 'em,
 Singing: "Water, Earth and Air and Fire,
 What more can mortal man desire? "
 (The Apple Tree's in leaf.)

As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree
The Angel of the Air he offered all the Air in fee;
 But Adam did not crave it,
 Nor the flight he wouldn't brave it,
 Singing: "Air and Water, Earth and Fire,
 What more can mortal man desire?"
 (The Apple Tree's in bloom.)

As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree
The Angel of the Fire rose up and not a word said he;
 But he wished a flame and made it,
 And in Adam's heart he laid it,
 Singing: "Fire, Fire, burning Fire!
 Stand up, and reach your heart's desire!"
 (The Apple Blossom's set.)

As Adam was a-working outside of Eden-Wall,
He used the Earth, he used the Seas, he used the Air and all;
 Till out of black disaster
 He arose to be a master
 Of Earth and Water, Air and Fire,
 But never reached his heart's desire!
 (The Apple Tree's cut down!)

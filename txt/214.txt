<p>In the garden strains of music,<br> Full of inexpressible sadness.<br> Scent of the sea, pungent, fresh,<br> On an ice bed, a dish of oysters.<br> <br> He said to me: 'I'm a true friend!'<br> And then touched my dress.<br> How unlike an embrace<br> The closeness of his caress.<br> <br> Thus, you stroke birds or cats, yes,<br> Thus you view shapely performers…<br> In his calm eyes only laughter,<br> Beneath pale-gold eyelashes.<br> <br> And the voices of sad viols<br> Sang behind drifting vapour:<br> 'Give thanks to heaven, then –<br> You're alone at last with your lover.'<br></p>

<p>For Yunia Anrep<br> <br> Is my destiny so changed,<br> Or the game really over?<br> Where are those winters I'd go to bed<br> At six in the morning?<br> <br> Newly tranquil and severe,<br> I'm living on a wild coastline,<br> No longer able to utter<br> A single kind or idle word.<br> <br> Can Christmas soon be here?<br> The steppe is touchingly green.<br> The sun glows. Lapping the shore<br> There's a warm-looking wave.<br> <br> When tired, languid from happiness,<br> I used to dream of such quiet,<br> With unutterable wonder,<br> And thus I imagined myself,<br> A posthumous, wandering soul.<br></p>

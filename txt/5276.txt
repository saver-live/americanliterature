<p>Now, I think there is a likeness<br> 'Twixt St Peter's life and mine<br> For he did a lot of trampin'<br> Long ago in Palestine.<br> He was "union" when the workers<br> First began to organise,<br> And I'm glad that old St Peter<br> Keeps the gate of Paradise.<br> <br> When the ancient agitator<br> And his brothers carried swags,<br> I've no doubt he very often<br> Tramped with empty tucker-bags;<br> And I'm glad he's Heaven's picket,<br> For I hate explainin' things,<br> And he'll think a union ticket<br> Just as good as Whitely King's.<br> <br> He denied the Saviour's union,<br> Which was weak of him, no doubt;<br> But perhaps his feet was blistered<br> And his boots had given out.<br> And the bitter storm was rushin'<br> On the bark and on the slabs,<br> And a cheerful fire was blazin',<br> And the hut was full of "scabs".<br> <br> When I reach the great head-station –<br> Which is somewhere "off the track" –<br> I won't want to talk with angels<br> Who have never been out back&nbsp;;<br> They might bother me with offers<br> Of a banjo – meanin' well –<br> And a pair of wings to fly with,<br> When I only want a spell.<br> <br> I'll just ask for old St Peter,<br> And I think, when he appears,<br> I will only have to tell him<br> That I carried swag for years.<br> "I've been on the track," I'll tell him,<br> "an' I done the best I could,"<br> And he'll understand me better<br> Than the other angels would.<br> <br> He won't try to get a chorus<br> Out of lungs that's worn to rags,<br> Or to graft the wings on shoulders<br> That is stiff with humpin' swags.<br> But I'll rest about the station<br> Where the work-bell never rings,<br> Till they blow the final trumpet<br> And the Great Judge sees to things.<br> <br></p>

<pre>CANTO I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A paradise for a sect; the savage, too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guesses at heaven; pity these have not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trac'd upon vellum or wild Indian leaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows of melodious utterance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But bare of laurel they live, dream, and die;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Poesy alone can tell her dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fine spell of words alone can save
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagination from the sable chain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dumb enchantment. Who alive can say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art no Poet, may'st not tell thy dreams?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since every man whose soul is not a clod
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath visions and would speak, if he had loved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And been well nurtured in his mother tongue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the dream now purpos'd to rehearse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be poet's or fanatic's will be known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this warm scribe, my hand, is in the grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methought I stood where trees of every clime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palm, myrtle, oak, and sycamore, and beech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With plantane and spice-blossoms, made a screen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In neighbourhood of fountains (by the noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft-showering in mine ears), and (by the touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of scent) not far from roses. Twining round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw an arbour with a drooping roof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of trellis vines, and bells, and larger blooms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like floral censers, swinging light in air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before its wreathed doorway, on a mound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of moss, was spread a feast of summer fruits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, nearer seen, seem'd refuse of a meal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By angel tasted or our Mother Eve;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For empty shells were scatter'd on the grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grapestalks but half-bare, and remnants more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet-smelling, whose pure kinds I could not know.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still was more plenty than the fabled horn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice emptied could pour forth at banqueting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Prosperine return'd to her own fields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the white heifers low. And appetite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More yearning than on earth I ever felt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing within, I ate deliciously,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, after not long, thirsted; for thereby
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood a cool vessel of transparent juice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sipp'd by the wander'd bee, the which I took,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pledging all the mortals of the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the dead whose names are in our lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drank. That full draught is parent of my theme.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Asian poppy nor elixir fine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the soon-fading, jealous, Caliphat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No poison gender'd in close monkish cell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thin the scarlet conclave of old men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could so have rapt unwilling life away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the fragment husks and berries crush'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the grass, I struggled hard against
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domineering potion, but in vain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloudy swoon came on, and down I sank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a Silenus on an antique vase.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long I slumber'd 'tis a chance to guess.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sense of life return'd, I started up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if with wings, but the fair trees were gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mossy mound and arbour were no more;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look'd around upon the curved sides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of an old sanctuary, with roof august,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builded so high, it seem'd that filmed clouds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might spread beneath as o'er the stars of heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So old the place was, I remember'd none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The like upon the earth: what I had seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of grey cathedrals, buttress'd walls, rent towers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superannuations of sunk realms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Nature's rocks toil'd hard in waves and winds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem'd but the faulture of decrepit things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that eternal domed monument.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the marble at my feet there lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Store of strange vessels and large draperies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which needs have been of dyed asbestos wove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in that place the moth could not corrupt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So white the linen, so, in some, distinct
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran imageries from a sombre loom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in a mingled heap confus'd there lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robes, golden tongs, censer and chafing-dish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girdles, and chains, and holy jewelries.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning from these with awe, once more I raised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes to fathom the space every way:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The embossed roof, the silent massy range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of columns north and south, ending in mist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nothing; then to eastward, where black gates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were shut against the sunrise evermore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the west I look'd, and saw far off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An image, huge of feature as a cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At level of whose feet an altar slept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be approach'd on either side by steps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And marble balustrade, and patient travail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To count with toil the innumerable degrees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the altar sober-pac'd I went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repressing haste as too unholy there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, coming nearer, saw beside the shrine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One ministering; and there arose a flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in mid-day the sickening east-wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifts sudden to the south, the small warm rain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melts out of the frozen incense from all flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fills the air with so much pleasant health
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That even the dying man forgets his shroud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so that lofty sacrificial fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending forth Maian incense, spread around
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetfulness of everything but bliss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clouded all the altar with soft smoke;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From whose white fragrant curtains thus I heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language pronounc'd: "If thou canst not ascend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These steps, die on that marble where thou art.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy flesh, near cousin to the common dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will parch for lack of nutriment; thy bones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will wither in few years, and vanish so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That not the quickest eye could find a grain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what thou now art on that pavement cold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands of thy short life are spent this hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no hand in the universe can turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy hourglass, if these gummed leaves be burnt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere thou canst mount up these immortal steps."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard, I look'd: two senses both at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fine, so subtle, felt the tyranny
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that fierce threat and the hard task proposed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prodigious seem'd the toil; the leaves were yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burning, when suddenly a palsied chill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck from the paved level up my limbs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was ascending quick to put cold grasp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon those streams that pulse beside the throat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shriek'd, and the sharp anguish of my shriek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stung my own ears; I strove hard to escape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbness, strove to gain the lowest step.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow, heavy, deadly was my pace: the cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew stifling, suffocating at the heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I clasp'd my hands I felt them not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One minute before death my ic'd foot touch'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest stair; and, as it touch'd, life seem'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pour in at the toes; I mounted up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As once fair angels on a ladder flew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the green turf to heaven. "Holy Power,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry'd I, approaching near the horned shrine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What am I that another death come not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To choke my utterance, sacrilegious, here?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the veiled shadow: "Thou hast felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 'tis to die and live again before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy fated hour; that thou hadst power to do so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is thine own safety; thou hast dated on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy doom." "High Prophetess," said I, "purge off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benign, if so it please thee, my mind's film."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"None can usurp this height," return'd that shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But those to whom the miseries of the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are misery, and will not let them rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All else who find a haven in the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they may thoughtless sleep away their days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If by a chance into this fane they come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rot on the pavement where thou rottedst half."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are there not thousands in the world," said I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encourag'd by the sooth voice of the shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who love their fellows even to the death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who feel the giant agony of the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more, like slaves to poor humanity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour for mortal good? I sure should see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other men here, but I am here alone."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those whom thou spakest of are no visionaries,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoin'd that voice; "they are no dreamers weak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seek no wonder but the human face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No music but a happy-noted voice:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They come not here, they have no thought to come;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou art here, for thou art less than they.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What benefit canst thou do, or all thy tribe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the great world? Thou art a dreaming thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fever of thyself: think of the earth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What bliss, even in hope, is there for thee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What haven? every creature hath its home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every sole man hath days of joy and pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether his labours be sublime or low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain alone, the joy alone, distinct:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the dreamer venoms all his days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing more woe than all his sins deserve.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, that happiness be somewhat shared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such things as thou art are admitted oft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into like gardens thou didst pass erewhile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suffer'd in these temples: for that cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou standest safe beneath this statue's knees."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That I am favour'd for unworthiness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such propitious parley medicined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sickness not ignoble, I rejoice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, and could weep for love of such award."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So answer'd I, continuing, "If it please,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majestic shadow, tell me where I am,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose altar this, for whom this incense curls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What image this whose face I cannot see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the broad marble knees; and who thou art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of accent feminine so courteous?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the tall shade, in drooping linen veil'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoke out, so much more earnest, that her breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stirr'd the thin folds of gauze that drooping hung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a golden censer from her hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pendent; and by her voice I knew she shed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-treasured tears. "This temple, sad and lone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is all spar'd from the thunder of a war
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foughten long since by giant hierarchy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against rebellion: this old image here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose carved features wrinkled as he fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Saturn's; I, Moneta, left supreme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sole goddess of this desolation."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no words to answer, for my tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Useless, could find about its roofed home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No syllable of a fit majesty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make rejoinder of Moneta's mourn:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silence, while the altar's blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fainting for sweet food. I look'd thereon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the paved floor, where nigh were piled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faggots of cinnamon, and many heaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of other crisped spicewood: then again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look'd upon the altar, and its horns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whiten'd with ashes, and its languorous flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then upon the offerings again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, by turns, till sad Moneta cry'd:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacrifice is done, but not the less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will I be kind to thee for thy good will.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My power, which to me is still a curse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be to thee a wonder; for the scenes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still swooning vivid through my globbed brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an electral changing misery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt with these dull mortal eyes behold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free from all pain, if wonder pain thee not."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As near as an immortal's sphered words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could to a mother's soften were these last:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I had a terror of her robes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chiefly of the veils that from her brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung pale, and curtain'd her in mysteries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made my heart too small to hold its blood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This saw that Goddess, and with sacred hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parted the veils. Then saw I a wan face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not pin'd by human sorrows, but bright-blanch'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an immortal sickness which kills not;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It works a constant change, which happy death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can put no end to; deathwards progressing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To no death was that visage; it had past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lilly and the snow; and beyond these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must not think now, though I saw that face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for her eyes I should have fled away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They held me back with a benignant light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft, mitigated by divinest lids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-clos'd, and visionless entire they seem'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all external things; they saw me not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in blank splendour beam'd, like the mild moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who comforts those she sees not, who knows not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What eyes are upward cast. As I had found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grain of gold upon a mountain's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, twing'd with avarice, strain'd out my eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To search its sullen entrails rich with ore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at the sad view of Moneta's brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask'd to see what things the hollow brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind environ'd: what high tragedy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark secret chambers of her skull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was acting, that could give so dread a stress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her cold lips, and fill with such a light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her planetary eyes, and touch her voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a sorrow? "Shade of Memory!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried I, with act adorant at her feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By all the gloom hung round thy fallen house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this last temple, by the golden age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Great Apollo, thy dear Foster-child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by thyself, forlorn divinity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale Omega of a wither'd race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me behold, according as thou saidst,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What in thy brain so ferments to and fro!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner had this conjuration past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My devout lips, than side by side we stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Like a stunt bramble by a solemn pine)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the fiery noon and eve's one star.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward I look'd beneath the gloomy boughs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw what first I thought an image huge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to the image pedestall'd so high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saturn's temple; then Moneta's voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came brief upon mine ear. "So Saturn sat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had lost his realms;" whereon there grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A power within me of enormous ken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see as a god sees, and take the depth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of things as nimbly as the outward eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can size and shape pervade. The lofty theme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those few words hung vast before my mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With half-unravell'd web. I sat myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon an eagle's watch, that I might see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing ne'er forget. No stir of life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was in this shrouded vale, not so much air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the zoning of a summer's day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where the dead leaf fell there did it rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stream went noiseless by, still deaden'd more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By reason of the fallen divinity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading more shade; the Naiad 'mid her reeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prest her cold finger closer to her lips.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No further than to where old Saturn's feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had rested, and there slept how long a sleep!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degraded, cold, upon the sodden ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsceptred, and his realmless eyes were closed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his bow'd head seem'd listening to the Earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there came one who, with a kindred hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reverence, though to one who knew it not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the griev'd voice of Mnemosyne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And griev'd I hearken'd. "That divinity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom thou saw'st step from yon forlornest wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with slow pace approach our fallen king,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Thea, softest-natured of our brood."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mark'd the Goddess, in fair statuary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surpassing wan Moneta by the head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in her sorrow nearer woman's tears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a list'ning fear in her regard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if calamity had but begun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the venom'd clouds of evil days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was with its stored thunder labouring up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand she press'd upon that aching spot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where beats the human heart, as if just there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other upon Saturn's bended neck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laid, and to the level of his ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning, with parted lips some words she spoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In solemn tenour and deep organ-tone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would come in this like accenting; how frail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that large utterance of the early gods!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Saturn, look up! and for what, poor lost king?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no comfort for thee; no, not one;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot say, wherefore thus sleepest thou?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Heaven is parted from thee, and the Earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows thee not, so afflicted, for a god.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ocean, too, with all its solemn noise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is emptied of thy hoary majesty.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy thunder, captious at the new command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy sharp lightning, in unpractis'd hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scourges and burns our once serene domain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With such remorseless speed still come new woes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That unbelief has not a space to breathe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn! sleep on: me thoughtless, why should I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn! sleep on, while at thy feet I weep."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when upon a tranced summer-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forests, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream, and so dream all night without a noise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save from one gradual solitary gust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swelling upon the silence, dying off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the ebbing air had but one wave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So came these words and went; the while in tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She prest her fair large forehead to the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just where her fallen hair might spread in curls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft and silken net for Saturn's feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long, long these two were postured motionless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sculpture builded-up upon the grave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or their own power. A long awful time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look'd upon them: still they were the same;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frozen God still bending to the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneta silent. Without stay or prop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my own weak mortality, I bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The load of this eternal quietude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unchanging gloom and the three fixed shapes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ponderous upon my senses, a whole moon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For by my burning brain I measured sure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her silver seasons shedded on the night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every day by day methought I grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More gaunt and ghostly. Oftentimes I pray'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intense, that death would take me from the vale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all its burthens; gasping with despair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of change, hour after hour I curs'd myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until old Saturn rais'd his faded eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look'd around and saw his kingdom gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that fair kneeling Goddess at his feet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the moist scent of flowers, and grass, and leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fills forest-dells with a pervading air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known to the woodland nostril, so the words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Saturn fill'd the mossy glooms around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to the hollows of time-eaten oaks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the windings of the foxes' hole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sad, low tones, while thus he spoke, and sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange moanings to the solitary Pan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moan, brethren, moan, for we are swallow'd up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buried from all godlike exercise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of influence benign on planets pale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And peaceful sway upon man's harvesting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all those acts which Deity supreme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth ease its heart of love in. Moan and wail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moan, brethren, moan; for lo, the rebel spheres
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin round; the stars their ancient courses keep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clouds still with shadowy moisture haunt the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still suck their fill of light from sun and moon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still buds the tree, and still the seashores murmur;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no death in all the universe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No smell of death. There shall be death. Moan, moan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moan, Cybele, moan; for thy pernicious babes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak as the reed, weak, feeble as my voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! Oh! the pain, the pain of feebleness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moan, moan, for still I thaw; or give me help;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throw down those imps, and give me victory.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me hear other groans, and trumpets blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gold peaks of heaven's high-piled clouds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful things made new, for the surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sky-children." So he feebly ceased,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a poor and sickly-sounding pause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methought I heard some old man of the earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bewailing earthly loss; nor could my eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ears act with that unison of sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which marries sweet sound with the grace of form,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dolorous accent from a tragic harp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With large-limb'd visions. More I scrutinized.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still fixt he sat beneath the sable trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose arms spread straggling in wild serpent forms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With leaves all hush'd; his awful presence there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Now all was silent) gave a deadly lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what I erewhile heard: only his lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembled amid the white curls of his beard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told the truth, though round the snowy locks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung nobly, as upon the face of heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mid-day fleece of clouds. Thea arose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stretcht her white arm through the hollow dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing some whither: whereat he too rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a vast giant, seen by men at sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To grow pale from the waves at dull midnight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They melted from my sight into the woods;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere I could turn, Moneta cry'd, "These twain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are speeding to the families of grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, rooft in by black rocks, they waste in pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And darkness, for no hope." And she spake on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ye may read who can unwearied pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward from the antechamber of this dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, even at the open doors, awhile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must delay, and glean my memory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her high phrase, perhaps no further dare.

CANTO II.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mortal, that thou may'st understand aright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I humanize my sayings to thine ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making comparisons of earthly things;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thou might'st better listen to the wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose language is to thee a barren noise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it blows legend-laden thro' the trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In melancholy realms big tears are shed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Titans fierce, self-hid or prison-bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groan for the old allegiance once more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening in their doom for Saturn's voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of the whole eagle-brood still keeps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sovereignty, and rule, and majesty:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still sits, still snuffs the incense teeming up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Man to the Sun's God, yet insecure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as upon the earth dire prodigies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fright and perplex, so also shudders he;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at dog's howl or gloom-bird's hated screech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the familiar visiting of one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the first toll of his passing bell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But horrors, portioned to a giant nerve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make great Hyperion ache. His palace bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bastion'd with pyramids of shining gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glares a blood-red thro' all the thousand courts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash angerly; when he would taste the wreaths
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of sweets, his ample palate takes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savour of poisonous brass and metals sick;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore when harbour'd in the sleepy West,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the full completion of fair day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rest divine upon exalted couch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slumber in the arms of melody,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paces through the pleasant hours of ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With strides colossal, on from hall to hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While far within each aisle and deep recess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His winged minions in close clusters stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amaz'd, and full of fear; like anxious men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who on a wide plain gather in sad troops,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now where Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes step for step with Thea from yon woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sloping to the threshold of the West.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither we tend." Now in the clear light I stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reliev'd from the dusk vale. Mnemosyne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was sitting on a square-edg'd polish'd stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in its lucid depth reflected pure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her priestess' garments. My quick eyes ran on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through bow'rs of fragrant and enwreathed light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon rush'd by the bright Hyperion;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave a roar as if of earthy fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scar'd away the meek ethereal hours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared.

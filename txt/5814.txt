<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights are out, and gone are all the guests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thronging came with merriment and jests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To celebrate the Hanging of the Crane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new house,--into the night are gone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still the fire upon the hearth burns on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I alone remain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O fortunate, O happy day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a new household finds its place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the myriad homes of earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a new star just sprung to birth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rolled on its harmonious way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the boundless realms of space!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said the guests in speech and song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the chimney, burning bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hung the iron crane to-night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And merry was the feast and long.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I sit and muse on what may be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in my vision see, or seem to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through floating vapors interfused with light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapes indeterminate, that gleam and fade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shadows passing into deeper shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sink and elude the sight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two alone, there in the hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As spread the table round and small;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the polished silver shine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening lamps, but, more divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of love shines over all;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love, that says not mine and thine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ours, for ours is thine and mine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want no guests, to come between
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tender glances like a screen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell them tales of land and sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whatsoever may betide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great, forgotten world outside;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want no guests; they needs must be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each other's own best company.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture fades; as at a village fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A showman's views, dissolving into air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again appear transfigured on the screen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in my fancy this; and now once more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In part transfigured, through the open door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appears the selfsame scene.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated, I see the two again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not alone; they entertain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little angel unaware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With face as round as is the moon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A royal guest with flaxen hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, throned upon his lofty chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drums on the table with his spoon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then drops it careless on the floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To grasp at things unseen before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these celestial manners? these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ways that win, the arts that please?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah yes; consider well the guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whatsoe'er he does seems best;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ruleth by the right divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of helplessness, so lately born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In purple chambers of the morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sovereign over thee and thine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaketh not; and yet there lies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conversation in his eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden silence of the Greek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravest wisdom of the wise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not spoken in language, but in looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More legible than printed books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he could but would not speak.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, O monarch absolute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy power is put to proof; for, lo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistless, fathomless, and slow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nurse comes rustling like the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pushes back thy chair and thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so good night to King Canute.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who walking in a forest sees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lovely landscape through the parted frees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sees it not, for boughs that intervene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as we see the moon sometimes revealed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through drifting clouds, and then again concealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I behold the scene.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two guests at table now;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king, deposed and older grown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer occupies the throne,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crown is on his sister's brow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Princess from the Fairy Isles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very pattern girl of girls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All covered and embowered in curls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose-tinted from the Isle of Flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sailing with soft, silken sails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From far-off Dreamland into ours.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above their bowls with rims of blue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four azure eyes of deeper hue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are looking, dreamy with delight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limpid as planets that emerge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the ocean's rounded verge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft-shining through the summer night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steadfast they gaze, yet nothing see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the horizon of their bowls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor care they for the world that rolls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its freight of troubled souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the days that are to be.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the tossing boughs shut out the scene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the drifting vapors intervene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon's pallid disk is hidden quite;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I see the table wider grown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As round a pebble into water thrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilates a ring of light.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the table wider grown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it garlanded with guests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if fair Ariadne's Crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the sky had fallen down;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maidens within whose tender breasts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand restless hopes and fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth reaching to the coming years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flutter awhile, then quiet lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like timid birds that fain would fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But do not dare to leave their nests;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And youths, who in their strength elate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenge the van and front of fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eager as champions to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the divine knight-errantry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of youth, that travels sea and land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking adventures, or pursues,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through cities, and through solitudes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequented by the lyric Muse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom with the beckoning hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That still allures and still eludes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sweet illusions of the brain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sudden thrills of fire and frost!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is bright while ye remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dark and dead when ye are lost!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meadow-brook, that seemeth to stand still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickens its current as it nears the mill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the stream of Time that lingereth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In level places, and so dull appears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runs with a swifter current as it nears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloomy mills of Death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, like the magician's scroll,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in the owner's keeping shrinks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With every wish he speaks or thinks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the last wish consumes the whole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table dwindles, and again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the two alone remain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crown of stars is broken in parts;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its jewels, brighter than the day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have one by one been stolen away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shine in other homes and hearts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is a wanderer now afar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ceylon or in Zanzibar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sunny regions of Cathay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one is in the boisterous camp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid clink of arms and horses' tramp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And battle's terrible array.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the patient mother read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With aching heart, of wrecks that float
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disabled on those seas remote,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of some great heroic deed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On battle-fields where thousands bleed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lift one hero into fame.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxious she bends her graceful head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above these chronicles of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trembles with a secret dread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest there among the drowned or slain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She find the one beloved name.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day of cloud and wind and rain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the setting sun breaks out again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touching all the darksome woods with light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiles on the fields, until they laugh and sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then like a ruby from the horizon's ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drops down into the night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What see I now?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm of grief, the clouds of care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind, the rain, have passed away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamps are lit, the fires burn bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house is full of life and light:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Golden Wedding day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guests come thronging in once more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick footsteps sound along the floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trooping children crowd the stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in and out and everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashes along the corridor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunshine of their golden hair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the round table in the hall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Ariadne's Crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the sky hath fallen down;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one Monarch of the Moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is drumming with his silver spoon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of love shines over all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O fortunate, O happy day!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people sing, the people say.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient bridegroom and the bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling contented and serene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the blithe, bewildering scene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, well pleased, on every side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their forms and features multiplied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the reflection of a light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between two burnished mirrors gleams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lamps upon a bridge at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretch on and on before the sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the long vista endless seems.

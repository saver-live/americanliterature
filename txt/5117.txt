<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray! My little body and whole span
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of years is Thine, my Owner and my Man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Thou hast made me, unto Thee I owe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dim, distressed half-soul that hurts me so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compact of every crime, but, none the less,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken by knowledge of its naughtiness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put me not from Thy Life, tis all I know.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Thou forsake me, whither shall I go?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine is the Voice with which my Day begins:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy Foot my refuge, even in my sins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine Honour hurls me forth to testify
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the Unclean and Wicked passing by.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(But when Thou callest they are of Thy Friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who readier than I to make amends?)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was Thy Deputy with high and low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Thou dismiss me, whither shall I go?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been driven forth on gross offence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That took no reckoning of my penitence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in my desolation, faithless me!,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have crept for comfort to a womans knee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I return, self-drawn, to meet the just
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reward of Riot, Theft and Breach of Trust.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put me not from Thy Life, though this is so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Thou forsake me, whither shall I go?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into The Presence, flattening while I crawl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From head to tail, I do confess it all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine was the fault, deal me the stripes, but spare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pointed Finger which I cannot bear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dreadful Tone in which my Name is named,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sends me neath the sofa-frill ashamed!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Yet, to be near Thee, I would face that woe.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Thou reject me, whither shall I go?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a gift turn Thee? I will bring mine all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Secret Bone, my Throwing-Stick, my Ball.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wouldst Thou sport? Then watch me hunt awhile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing, not after conies, but Thy Smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content, as breathless on the turf I sit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shouldst deride my little legs and wit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Keep me in Thy Life for a fools show!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Thou deny me, whither shall I go! . . .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Dark gone? The Light of Eyes restored?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countenance turned meward, O my Lord?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paw accepted, and, for all to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abject Sinner throned upon the Knee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ears bewrung, and Muzzle scratched because
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is forgiven, and All is as It was?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now am I in Thy Life, and since tis so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Cat awaits the Judgment. May I go?

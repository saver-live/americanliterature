<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Swayed upon the gaudy stern
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butt end of a steering oar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everywhere that I could turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men ran upon the shore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though I would have hushed the crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no mothers son but said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the figure in a shroud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a gaudy bed?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fishes bubbling to the brim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried out upon that thing beneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had such dignity of limb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the sweet name of Death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Id my finger on my lip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could I but take up the song?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fish and crowd and gaudy ship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried out the whole night long,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying amid the glittering sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naming it with ecstatic breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it had such dignity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the sweet name of Death.

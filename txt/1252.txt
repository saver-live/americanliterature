&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now give us lands where the olives grow,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried the North to the South,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where the sun with a golden mouth can blow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow bubbles of grapes down a vineyard-row!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried the North to the South.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now give us men from the sunless plain,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried the South to the North,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By need of work in the snow and rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made strong, and brave by familiar pain!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried the South to the North.

II
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give lucider hills and intenser seas,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the North to the South.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since ever by symbols and bright degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art, childlike, climbs to the dear Lord's knees,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the North to the South.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give strenuous souls for belief and prayer",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the South to the North,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That stand in the dark on the lowest stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While affirming of God 'He is certainly there',"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the South to the North.

III
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yet oh, for the skies that are softer and higher!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed the North to the South;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the flowers that blaze, and the trees that aspire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the insects made of a song or a fire!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed the North to the South.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And oh, for a seer to discern the same!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed the South to the North;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For a poet's tongue of baptismal flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To call the tree or the flower by its name!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed the South to the North.

IV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North sent therefore a man of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a grace to the South;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus to Rome came Andersen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas, but must you take him again?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the South to the North.

<p><cite class="al-title">A Modern Utopia</cite> (1905) is Wells' hybrid between fiction and philosophical discussion, reviewed as: <i>"a conscious attempt to describe a utopia that is not utopian."</i> Wells was unsatisfied with his earlier writings on the subject, proclaiming this as his last novel of its type, intended to <i>"settle accounts with a number of issues."</i> Don't let "Utopia" in the title fool you: <i>"I have written into it as well as I can the heretical metaphysical scepticism upon which all my thinking rests."</i> <br><i>[Painting by Kuniyoshi Utagawa, Suikoden series, 1830]</i></p><p>Many of Wells' works are featured in our collection of <a href="/dystopian-stories">Dystopian Stories</a>.</p><p><a href="a-note-to-the-reader">A Note to the Reader</a></p><p><a href="the-owner-of-the-voice">The Owner of the Voice</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-first-topographical">Chapter the First - Topographical</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-second-concerning-freedoms">Chapter the Second - Concerning Freedoms</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-third-utopian-economics">Chapter the Third - Utopian Economics</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-fourth-the-voice-of-nature">Chapter the Fourth - The Voice of Nature</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-fifth-failure-in-a-modern-utopia">Chapter the Fifth - Failure in a Modern Utopia</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-sixth-women-in-a-modern-utopia">Chapter the Sixth - Women in a Modern Utopia</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-seventh-a-few-utopian-impressions">Chapter the Seventh - A Few Utopian Impressions</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-eighth-my-utopian-self">Chapter the Eighth - My Utopian Self</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-ninth-the-samurai">Chapter the Ninth - The Samurai</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-tenth-race-in-utopia">Chapter the Tenth - Race in Utopia</a></p><p><a href="chapter-the-eleventh-the-bubble-bursts">Chapter the Eleventh - The Bubble Bursts</a></p><p><a href="appendix-scepticism-of-the-instrument">Appendix - Scepticism of the Instrument</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/hg-wells">H.G.

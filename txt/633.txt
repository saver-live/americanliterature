<p>&nbsp;<br> SO-KIN of Rakuho, ancient friend, I now remember<br> That you built me a special tavern,<br> By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin.<br> With yellow gold and white jewels<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we paid for the songs and laughter,<br> And we were drunk for month after month,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgetting the kings and princes.<br> Intelligent men came drifting in, from the sea<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from the west border,<br> And with them, and with you especially,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was nothing at cross-purpose;<br> And they made nothing of sea-crossing<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or of mountain-crossing,<br> If only they could be of that fellowship.<br> And we all spoke out our hearts and minds …<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and without regret.<br> And then I was sent off to South Wei,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smothered in laurel groves,<br> And you to the north of Raku-hoku,<br> Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories between us.<br> And when separation had come to its worst<br> We met, and travelled together into Sen-Go<br> Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and twisting waters;<br> Into a valley of a thousand bright flowers …<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was the first valley,<br> And on into ten thousand valleys<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full of voices and pine-winds.<br> With silver harness and reins of gold,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prostrating themselves on the ground,<br> Out came the East-of-Kan foreman and his company;<br> And there came also the “True-man” of Shi-yo to meet me,<br> Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.<br> In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more Sennin music;<br> Many instruments, like the sound of young phœnix broods.<br> And the foreman of Kan-Chu, drunk,<br> Danced because his long sleeves<br> Wouldn’t keep still, with that music playing.<br> And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on his lap,<br> And my spirit so high that it was all over the heavens.<br> &nbsp;<br> And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars or rain.<br> I had to be off to So, far away over the waters,<br> You back to your river-bridge.<br> And your father, who was brave as a leopard,<br> Was governor in Hei Shu and put down the barbarian rabble.<br> And one May he had you send for me, despite the long distance;<br> And what with broken wheels and so on, I won’t say it wasn’t hard going -<br> Over roads twisted like sheep’s guts.<br> And I was still going, late in the year,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the cutting wind from the north,<br> And thinking how little you cared for the cost -<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you caring enough to pay it.<br> Then what a reception!<br> Red jade cups, food well set, on a blue jewelled table;<br> And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning;<br> And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the castle,<br> To the dynastic temple, with the water about it clear as blue jade,<br> With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums,<br> With ripples like dragon-scales going grass-green on the water,<br> Pleasure lasting, with courtezans going and coming without hindrance,<br> With the willow-flakes falling like snow,<br> And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,<br> And the waters a hundred feet deep reflecting green eyebrows—<br> Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young moonlight,<br> Gracefully painted—and the girls singing back at each other,<br> Dancing in transparent brocade,<br> And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,<br> Tossing it up under the clouds.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all this comes to an end,<br> And is not again to be met with.<br> I went up to the court for examination,<br> Tried Layu’s luck, offered the Choyu song,<br> And got no promotion,<br> And went back to the East Mountains white-headed.<br> <br> And once again we met, later, at the South Bridge head.<br> And then the crowd broke up—you went north to San palace.<br> And if you ask how I regret that parting?<br> It is like the flowers falling at spring’s end,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confused, whirled in a tangle.<br> What is the use of talking! And there is no end of talking-<br> There is no end of things in the heart.<br> <br> I call in the boy,<br> Have him sit on his knees to write and seal this,<br> And I send it a thousand miles, thinking.<br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spenser! a jealous honourer of thine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A forester deep in thy midmost trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did last eve ask my promise to refine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some English that might strive thine ear to please.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Elfin Poet 'tis impossible
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an inhabitant of wintry earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rise like Phoebus with a golden quill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire-wing'd and make a morning in his mirth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to escape from toil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O' the sudden and receive thy spiriting:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower must drink the nature of the soil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it can put forth its blossoming:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be with me in the summer days, and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will for thine honour and his pleasure try.
</pre>

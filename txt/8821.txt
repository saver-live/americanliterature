<p>THE patient craftsman of the East who made<br> His undulant dragons of the veined jade,<br> And wound their sinuous volutes round the whole<br> Pellucid green redundance of the bowl,<br> Chiseled his subtle traceries with the same<br> Keen stone he wrought them in.<br> Nor praise, nor blame,<br> Nor gifts the years relinquish or refuse,<br> But only a grief commensurate with thy soul,<br> Shall carve it in a shape for gods to use.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, my children, and you shall hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly a man is now alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who remembers that famous day and year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to his friend, "If the British march
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By land or sea from the town to-night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the North Church tower as a signal light,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, if by land, and two, if by sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I on the opposite shore will be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to ride and spread the alarm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through every Middlesex village and farm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the country folk to be up and to arm,"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, "Good night!" and with muffled oar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the moon rose over the bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Somerset, British man-of-war;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the moon like a prison bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a huge black hulk, that was magnified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its own reflection in the tide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanders and watches with eager ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in the silence around him he hears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muster of men at the barrack door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the measured tread of the grenadiers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marching down to their boats on the shore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the belfry-chamber overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And startled the pigeons from their perch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sombre rafters, that round him made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masses and moving shapes of shade,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the trembling ladder, steep and tall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the highest window in the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he paused to listen and look down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment on the roofs of the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moonlight flowing over all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their night-encampment on the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in silence so deep and still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchful night-wind, as it went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creeping along from tent to tent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment only he feels the spell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a shadowy something far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the river widens to meet the bay,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line of black that bends and floats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he patted his horse's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now gazed at the landscape far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mostly he watched with eager search
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belfry-tower of the Old North Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it rose above the graves on the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second lamp in the belfry burns!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hurry of hoofs in a village street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was all!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, through the gloom and the light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of a nation was riding that night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has left the village and mounted the steep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the alders, that skirt its edge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was twelve by the village clock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the crowing of the cock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the barking of the farmer's dog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt the damp of the river fog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rises after the sun goes down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one by the village clock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he galloped into Lexington.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the gilded weathercock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they already stood aghast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bloody work they would look upon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was two by the village clock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the bleating of the flock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the twitter of birds among the trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt the breath of the morning breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing over the meadows brown.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was safe and asleep in his bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who that day would be lying dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierced by a British musket-ball.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the books you have read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the British Regulars fired and fled,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From behind each fence and farm-yard wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then crossing the fields to emerge again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the trees at the turn of the road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only pausing to fire and load.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through the night rode Paul Revere;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so through the night went his cry of alarm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To every Middlesex village and farm,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cry of defiance and not of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a word that shall echo forevermore!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all our history, to the last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people will waken and listen to hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the midnight message of Paul Revere.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord ended thus his tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rising took down from its nail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword that hung there, dim with dust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cleaving to its sheath with rust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "This sword was in the fight."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet seized it, and exclaimed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the sword of a good knight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though homespun was his coat-of-mail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter if it be not named
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyeuse, Colada, Durindale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excalibar, or Aroundight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or other name the books record?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ancestor, who bore this sword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Colonel of the Volunteers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounted upon his old gray mare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen here and there and everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me a grander shape appears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than old Sir William, or what not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinking about in foreign lands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With iron gauntlets on his hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on his head an iron pot!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All laughed; the Landlord's face grew red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his escutcheon on the wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not comprehend at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drift of what the Poet said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who had been longest dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were always greatest in his eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be was speechless with surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see Sir William's plumed head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought to a level with the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made the subject of a jest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this perceiving, to appease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord's wrath, the others' fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student said, with careless ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ladies and the cavaliers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arms, the loves, the courtesies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deeds of high emprise, I sing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Ariosto says, in words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have the stately stride and ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of armed knights and clashing swords.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now listen to the tale I bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen! though not to me belong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing draperies of his song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words that rouse, the voice that charms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord's tale was one of arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a tale of love is mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blending the human and divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale of the Decameron, told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Palmieri's garden old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Fiametta, laurel-crowned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While her companions lay around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard the intermingled sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of airs that on their errands sped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wild birds gossiping overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lisp of leaves, and fountain's fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her own voice more sweet than all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling the tale, which, wanting these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance may lose its power to please."

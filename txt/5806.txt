<pre>MAY 28, 1857

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was fifty years ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant month of May,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beautiful Pays de Vaud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child in its cradle lay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nature, the old nurse, took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child upon her knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying: "Here is a story-book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy Father has written for thee."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, wander with me," she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Into regions yet untrod;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And read what is still unread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the manuscripts of God."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he wandered away and away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Nature, the dear old nurse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sang to him night and day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rhymes of the universe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whenever the way seemed long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or his heart began to fail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would sing a more wonderful song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or tell a more marvellous tale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she keeps him still a child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will not let him go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though at times his heart beats wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the beautiful Pays de Vaud;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though at times he hears in his dreams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranz des Vaches of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rush of mountain streams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From glaciers clear and cold;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mother at home says, "Hark!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his voice I listen and yearn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is growing late and dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my boy does not return!"

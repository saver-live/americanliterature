<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Bess was Harrys daughter. Stand forward partners all!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ruff and stomacher and gown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She danced King Philip down-a down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left her shoe to show twas true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The very tune Im playing you)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Norgem at Brickwall!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen was in her chamber, and she was middling old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her petticoat was satin, and her stomacher was gold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backward and forward and sideways did she pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making up her mind to face the cruel looking-glass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruel looking-glass that will never show a lass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As comely or as kindly or as young as what she was!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Bess was Harrys daughter. Now hand your partners all!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen was in her chamber, a-combing of her hair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came Queen Marys spirit and It stood behind her chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing Backward and forward and sideways may you pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will stand behind you till you face the looking-glass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruel looking-glass that will never show a lass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lovely or unlucky or as lonely as I was!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Bess was Harrys daughter. Now turn your partners all!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen was in her chamber, a-weeping very sore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came Lord Leicesters spirit and It scratched upon the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing Backward and forward and sideways may you pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will walk beside you till you face the looking-glass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruel looking-glass that will never show a lass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hard and unforgiving or as wicked as you was!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Bess was Harrys daughter. Now kiss your partners all !

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen was in her chamber, her sins were on her head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked the spirits up and down and statelily she said:,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backward and forward and sideways though Ive been,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I am Harrys daughter and I am Englands Queen!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she faced the looking-glass (and whatever else there was)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she saw her day was over and she saw her beauty pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cruel looking-glass, that can always hurt a lass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More hard than any ghost there is or any man there was!

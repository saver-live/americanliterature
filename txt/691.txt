<p>Amongst bubbling streams<br> a dog barks; peach blossom<br> is heavy with dew; here<br> and there a deer can<br> be seen in forest glades!<br> No sound of the mid-day<br> bell enters this fastness<br> where blue mist rises<br> from bamboo groves;<br> down from a high peak<br> hangs a waterfall;<br> non knows where he has gone, so sadly I rest,<br> with my back leaning<br> against a pine. <br></p>

The fox lay still by the birch-tree's root
     In the heather.
The hare was running with nimble foot
     O'er the heather.
Was ever brighter a sunshine-day,
Before, behind me, and every way,
     O'er the heather!
The fox laughed low by the birch-tree's root
     In the heather.
The hare was running with daring foot
     O'er the heather.
I am so happy for everything!
Hallo! Why go you with mighty spring
     O'er the heather?
The fox lay hid by the birch-tree's root
     In the heather.
The hare dashed to him with reckless foot
     O'er the heather.
May God have mercy, but this is queer! â€”
Good gracious, how dare you dance so here
     O'er the heather?

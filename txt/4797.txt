<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I know what Order brings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me into being?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only know, if you do certain things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must become your Hearing and your Seeing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also your Strength, to make great wheels go round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And save your sons from toil, while I am bound!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I care how you dispose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Powers that move me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only know that I am one with those
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True Powers which rend the firmament above me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, harrying earth, would save me at the last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that your coward foresight holds me fast!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Sovereign power of love! O grief! O balm!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shadowy, through the mist of passed years:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For others, good or bad, hatred and tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have become indolent; but touching thine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woes of Troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggling, and blood, and shrieks, all dimly fades
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into some backward corner of the brain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, in our very souls, we feel amain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swart planet in the universe of deeds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the pebbled shore of memory!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many old rotten-timber'd boats there be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon thy vaporous bosom, magnified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wherefore this? What care, though owl did fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the great Athenian admiral's mast?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What care, though striding Alexander past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indus with his Macedonian numbers?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glutted Cyclops, what care? Juliet leaning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid her window-flowers, sighing, weaning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth more avail than these: the silver flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Pastorella in the bandit's den,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are things to brood on with more ardency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the death-day of empires. Fearfully
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must such conviction come upon his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without one muse's smile, or kind behest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The path of love and poesy. But rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to be crush'd, in striving to uprear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's standard on the battlements of song.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So once more days and nights aid me along,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like legion'd soldiers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brain-sick shepherd-prince,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What promise hast thou faithful guarded since
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of sacrifice? Or, have new sorrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! 'tis his old grief. For many days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has he been wandering in uncertain ways:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he is sitting by a shady spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And elbow-deep with feverous fingering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stems the upbursting cold: a wild rose tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pavilions him in bloom, and he doth see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bud which snares his fancy: lo! but now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plucks it, dips its stalk in the water: how!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in the middle, there is softly pight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden butterfly; upon whose wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be surely character'd strange things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightly this little herald flew aloft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward it flies. From languor's sullen bands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like a new-born spirit did he pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the green evening quiet in the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer time away. One track unseams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sinks adown a solitary glen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there was never sound of mortal men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melting to silence, when upon the breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it reached a splashing fountain's side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the temperate air: then high it soar'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, downward, suddenly began to dip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with mealy gold the waters clear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at that very touch, to disappear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion sought around, and shook each bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a nymph uprisen to the breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him her dripping hand she softly kist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And anxiously began to plait and twist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her ringlets round her fingers, saying: "Youth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bitterness of love: too long indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the bright riches of my crystal coffer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My charming rod, my potent river spells;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meander gave me, for I bubbled up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fainting creatures in a desert wild.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But woe is me, I am but as a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is, that I pity thee; that on this day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been thy guide; that thou must wander far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other regions, past the scanty bar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From every wasting sigh, from every pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the gentle bosom of thy love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a ditty for my hollow cell."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereat, she vanished from Endymion's gaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who brooded o'er the water in amaze:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding his forehead, to keep off the burr
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus breath'd he to himself: "Whoso encamps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a fancied city of delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After long toil and travelling, to miss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another city doth he set about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free from the smallest pebble-bead of doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he will seize on trickling honey-combs:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And onward to another city speeds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is human life: the war, the deeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disappointment, the anxiety,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagination's struggles, far and nigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All human; bearing in themselves this good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they are sill the air, the subtle food,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make us feel existence, and to shew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether to weeds or flowers; but for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no depth to strike in: I can see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought earthly worth my compassing; so stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a misty, jutting head of land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When mad Eurydice is listening to 't;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd rather stand upon this misty peak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than be I care not what. O meekest dove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thy blue throne, now filling all the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glance but one little beam of temper'd light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into my bosom, that the dreadful might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would give a pang to jealous misery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse than the torment's self: but rather tie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large wings upon my shoulders, and point out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love's far dwelling. Though the playful rout
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too keen in beauty, for thy silver prow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O be propitious, nor severely deem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My madness impious; for, by all the stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tend thy bidding, I do think the bars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That kept my spirit in are burst that I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beautiful thou art! The world how deep!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around their axle! Then these gleaming reins,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How lithe! When this thy chariot attains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is airy goal, haply some bower veils
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those twilight eyes? Those eyes! my spirit fails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will gulph me help!" At this with madden'd stare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like old Deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or blind Orion hungry for the morn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, but from the deep cavern there was borne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had more been heard. Thus swell'd it forth: "Descend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the sparry hollows of the world!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from thy threshold, day by day hast been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little lower than the chilly sheen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the deadening ether that still charms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their marble being: now, as deep profound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As those are high, descend! He ne'er is crown'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With immortality, who fears to follow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where airy voices lead: so through the hollow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent mysteries of earth, descend!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard but the last words, nor could contend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moment in reflection: for he fled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the fearful deep, to hide his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharpening, by degrees, his appetite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dusky empire and its diadems;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One faint eternal eventide of gems.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along whose track the prince quick footsteps told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its lines abrupt and angular:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a vast antre; then the metal woof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy into belief: anon it leads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through winding passages, where sameness breeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vexing conceptions of some sudden change;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether to silver grots, or giant range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred waterfalls, whose voices come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bosom grew, when first he, far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descried an orbed diamond, set to fray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old darkness from his throne: 'twas like the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprisen o'er chaos: and with such a stun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw not fiercer wonders past the wit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of any spirit to tell, but one of those
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, when this planet's sphering time doth close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be its high remembrancers: who they?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty ones who have made eternal day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Greece and England. While astonishment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a marble gallery, passing through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mimic temple, so complete and true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To search it inwards, whence far off appear'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiver'd Dian. Stepping awfully,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down sidelong aisles, and into niches old.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when, more near against the marble cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All courts and passages, where silence dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself with every mystery, and awe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, weary, he sat down before the maw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wild uncertainty and shadows grim.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey homeward to habitual self!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the bosom of a hated thing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What misery most drowningly doth sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lone Endymion's ear, now he has caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of consciousness? Ah, 'tis the thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly feel of solitude: for lo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot see the heavens, nor the flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But far from such companionship to wear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was now his lot. And must he patient stay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracing fantastic figures with his spear?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" exclaimed he, "why should I tarry here?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! loudly echoed times innumerable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which he straightway started, and 'gan tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His paces back into the temple's chief;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warming and glowing strong in the belief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of help from Dian: so that when again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught her airy form, thus did he plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving more near the while. "O Haunter chaste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where with thy silver bow and arrows keen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou now forested? O woodland Queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where dost thou listen to the wide halloos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy disparted nymphs? Through what dark tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glimmers thy crescent? Wheresoe'er it be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis in the breath of heaven: thou dost taste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy loveliness in dismal elements;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, finding in our green earth sweet contents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels Elysian, how rich to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within my breast there lives a choking flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A homeward fever parches up my tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me slake it at the running springs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my ear a noisy nothing rings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me once more hear the linnet's note!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O think how this dry palate would rejoice!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh think how I should love a bed of flowers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young goddess! let me see my native bowers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliver me from this rapacious deep!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His destiny, alert he stood: but when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obstinate silence came heavily again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling about for its old couch of space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To its old channel, or a swollen tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itself, and strives its own delights to hide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor in one spot alone; the floral pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a long whispering birth enchanted grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his footsteps; as when heav'd anew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his fairy journey on he hastes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moment with his hand among the sweets:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward he goes he stops his bosom beats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As plainly in his ear, as the faint charm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which the throbs were born. This still alarm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it came more softly than the east could blow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arion's magic to the Atlantic isles;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or than the west, made jealous by the smiles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thron'd Apollo, could breathe back the lyre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seas Ionian and Tyrian.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O did he ever live, that lonely man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lov'd and music slew not? 'Tis the pest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That things of delicate and tenderest worth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By one consuming flame: it doth immerse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suffocate true blessings in a curse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-happy, by comparison of bliss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is miserable. 'Twas even so with this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dew-dropping melody, in the Carian's ear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanish'd in elemental passion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down some swart abysm he had gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had not a heavenly guide benignant led
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing, awakened: then the sounds again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went noiseless as a passing noontide rain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a bower, where little space he stood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as the sunset peeps into a wood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saw he panting light, and towards it went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a thousand mazes overgone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, with sudden step, he came upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more of beautiful and strange beside:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on a silken couch of rosy pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ripe October's faded marigolds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not hiding up an Apollonian curve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rather, giving them to the filled sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officiously. Sideway his face repos'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To slumbery pout; just as the morning south
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disparts a dew-lipp'd rose. Above his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four lily stalks did their white honours wed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a coronal; and round him grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convolvulus in streaked vases flush;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And virgin's bower, trailing airily;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With others of the sisterhood. Hard by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood serene Cupids watching silently.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muffling to death the pathos with his wings;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, ever and anon, uprose to look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the youth's slumber; while another took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook it on his hair; another flew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At these enchantments, and yet many more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breathless Latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until, impatient in embarrassment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling, thus whisper'd: "Though from upper day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some ethereal and high-favouring donor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was I in no wise startled. So recline
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon these living flowers. Here is wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive with sparkles never, I aver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Ariadne was a vintager,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were high about Pomona: here is cream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By any touch, a bunch of blooming plums
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to melt between an infant's gums:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In starlight, by the three Hesperides.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all these things around us." He did so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus: "I need not any hearing tire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him all in all unto her doting self.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was content to let her amorous plea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint through his careless arms; content to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content, O fool! to make a cold retreat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay sorrowing; when every tear was born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush! no exclaim yet, justly mightst thou call
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curses upon his head. I was half glad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my poor mistress went distract and mad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That same Adonis, safe in the privacy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this still region all his winter-sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The which she fills with visions, and doth dress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all this quiet luxury; and hath set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us young immortals, without any let,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to a moment's filling up, and fast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She scuds with summer breezes, to pant through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embower'd sports in Cytherea's isle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look! how those winged listeners all this while
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand anxious: see! behold!" This clamant word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke through the careful silence; for they heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while one hand, that erst upon his thigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to his forehead. Then there was a hum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sudden voices, echoing, "Come! come!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full soothingly to every nested finch:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this, from every side they hurried in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And doubling overhead their little fists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In backward yawns. But all were soon alive:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the arbour roof down swell'd an air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odorous and enlivening; making all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disparted, and far upward could be seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spun off a drizzling dew, which falling chill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nestle and turn uneasily about.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silken traces lighten'd in descent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon, returning from love's banishment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Venus leaning downward open arm'd:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tumult to his heart, and a new life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for her comforting! unhappy sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these first minutes? The unchariest muse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O it has ruffled every spirit there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving love's self, who stands superb to share
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general gladness: awfully he stands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sovereign quell is in his waving hands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sight can bear the lightning of his bow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His quiver is mysterious, none can know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What themselves think of it; from forth his eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look full upon it feel anon the blue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion feels it, and no more controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had begun a plaining of his woe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Venus, bending forward, said: "My child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Favour this gentle youth; his days are wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With love he but alas! too well I see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou know'st the deepness of his misery.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That when through heavy hours I used to rue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless sleep of this new-born Adon',
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stranger ay I pitied. For upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dreary morning once I fled away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the breezy clouds, to weep and pray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me even to tears: thence, when a little eas'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw this youth as he despairing stood:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those same full fringed lids a constant blind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over his sullen eyes: I saw him throw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself on wither'd leaves, even as though
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fair immortal, and that his embrace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had zoned her through the night. There is no trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this in heaven: I have mark'd each cheek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And find it is the vainest thing to seek;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that of all things 'tis kept secretest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So still obey the guiding hand that fends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a concealment needful in extreme;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here must we leave thee." At these words up flew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impatient doves, up rose the floating car,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up went the hum celestial. High afar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latmian saw them minish into nought;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all was darkened, with Etnean throe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth clos'd gave a solitary moan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him once again in twilight lone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not rave, he did not stare aghast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all those visions were o'ergone, and past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he in loneliness: he felt assur'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of happy times, when all he had endur'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would seem a feather to the mighty prize.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, with unusual gladness, on he hies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black polish'd porticos of awful shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, at the last, a diamond balustrade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading afar past wild magnificence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretching across a void, then guiding o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streams subterranean tease their granite beds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then heighten'd just above the silvery heads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waters with his spear; but at the splash,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His diamond path with fretwork, streaming round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this delight; for, every minute's space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streams with changed magic interlace:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes like delicatest lattices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving about as in a gentle wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spangled, and rich with liquid broideries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter than lightning went these wonders rare;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the water, into stubborn streams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those dusk places in times far aloof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cathedrals call'd. He bade a loth farewel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackening on every side, and overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solitary felt a hurried change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working within him into something dreary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he revives at once: for who beholds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came mother Cybele! alone alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About her majesty, and front death-pale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With turrets crown'd. Four maned lions hale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplifted drowsily, and nervy tails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shadowy queen athwart, and faints away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another gloomy arch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore delay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young traveller, in such a mournful place?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou wayworn, or canst not further trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diamond path? And does it indeed end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call ardently! He was indeed wayworn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without one impious word, himself he flings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to the darkness and the gloom:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With airs delicious. In the greenest nook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle landed him, and farewel took.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With golden moss. His every sense had grown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethereal for pleasure; 'bove his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew a delight half-graspable; his tread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Hesperèan; to his capable ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence was music from the holy spheres;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dewy luxury was in his eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stirr'd them faintly. Verdant cave and cell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sudden exaltation: but, "Alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he, "will all this gush of feeling pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away in solitude? And must they wane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like melodies upon a sandy plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an echo? Then shall I be left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sad, so melancholy, so bereft!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still I feel immortal! O my love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My breath of life, where art thou? High above,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dancing before the morning gates of heaven?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or keeping watch among those starry seven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Atlas' children? Art a maid of the waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of shell-winding Triton's bright-hair'd daughters?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or art, impossible! a nymph of Dian's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaving a coronal of tender scions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For very idleness? Where'er thou art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methinks it now is at my will to start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into thine arms; to scare Aurora's train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To scud like a wild bird, and take thee off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, too eagerly my soul deceives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its powerless self: I know this cannot be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me then by some sweet dreaming flee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some few hours the coming solitude."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus spake he, and that moment felt endued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With power to dream deliciously; so wound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a dim passage, searching till he found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw himself, and just into the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A naked waist: "Fair Cupid, whence is this?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-known voice sigh'd, "Sweetest, here am I!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which soft ravishment, with doating cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They trembled to each other. Helicon!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O fountain'd hill! Old Homer's Helicon!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sorry pages; then the verse would soar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing above this gentle pair, like lark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over his nested young: but all is dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around thine aged top, and thy clear fount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mighty Poets is made up; the scroll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is folded by the Muses; the bright roll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is in Apollo's hand: our dazed eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have seen a new tinge in the western skies:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has done its duty. Yet, oh yet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sun of poesy is set,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lovers did embrace, and we must weep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That there is no old power left to steep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quill immortal in their joyous tears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time in silence did their anxious fears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question that thus it was; long time they lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fondling and kissing every doubt away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time ere soft caressing sobs began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mellow into words, and then there ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O known Unknown! from whom my being sips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such darling essence, wherefore may I not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be ever in these arms? in this sweet spot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillow my chin for ever? ever press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not for ever and for ever feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That breath about my eyes? Ah, thou wilt steal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from me again, indeed, indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt be gone away, and wilt not heed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lonely madness. Speak, my kindest fair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is is it to be so? No! Who will dare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pluck thee from me? And, of thine own will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full well I feel thou wouldst not leave me. Still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me entwine thee surer, surer now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we part? Elysium! who art thou?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, that thou canst not be for ever here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lift me with thee to some starry sphere?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the most soft completion of thy face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those lips, O slippery blisses, twinkling eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by these tenderest, milky sovereignties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tenderest, and by the nectar-wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passion" "O lov'd Ida the divine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion! dearest! Ah, unhappy me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soul will 'scape us O felicity!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he does love me! His poor temples beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the very tune of love how sweet, sweet, sweet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revive, dear youth, or I shall faint and die;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revive, or these soft hours will hurry by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tranced dulness; speak, and let that spell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affright this lethargy! I cannot quell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its heavy pressure, and will press at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lips to thine, that they may richly feast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we taste the life of love again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! dost thou move? dost kiss? O bliss! O pain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love thee, youth, more than I can conceive;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so long absence from thee doth bereave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul of any rest: yet must I hence:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, can I not to starry eminence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplift thee; nor for very shame can own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself to thee. Ah, dearest, do not groan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thou wilt force me from this secrecy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I must blush in heaven. O that I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had done it already; that the dreadful smiles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had waned from Olympus' solemn height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from all serious Gods; that our delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was quite forgotten, save of us alone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wherefore so ashamed? 'Tis but to atone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet must I be a coward! Horror rushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too palpable before me the sad look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Jove Minerva's start no bosom shook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With awe of purity no Cupid pinion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reverence veiled my crystaline dominion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half lost, and all old hymns made nullity!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is this to love? O I could fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thee into the ken of heavenly powers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press me so sweetly. Now I swear at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I am wise, that Pallas is a dunce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps her love like mine is but unknown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O I do think that I have been alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In chastity: yes, Pallas has been sighing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While every eve saw me my hair uptying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was as vague as solitary dove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An immortality of passion's thine:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere long I will exalt thee to the shine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven ambrosial; and we will shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ourselves whole summers by a river glade;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will tell thee stories of the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My happy love will overwing all bounds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me melt into thee; let the sounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our close voices marry at their birth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us entwine hoveringly O dearth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human words! roughness of mortal speech!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lispings empyrean will I sometime teach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine honied tongue lute-breathings, which I gasp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have thee understand, now while I clasp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee thus, and weep for fondness I am pain'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion: woe! woe! is grief contain'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melted into a languor. He return'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entranced vows and tears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye who have yearn'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With too much passion, will here stay and pity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not of these days, but long ago 'twas told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a cavern wind unto a forest old;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the forest told it in a dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poet caught as he was journeying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Phoebus' shrine; and in it he did fling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after, straight in that inspired place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sang the story up into the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving it universal freedom. There
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has it been ever sounding for those ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must surely be self-doomed or he will rue it:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For quenchless burnings come upon the heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made fiercer by a fear lest any part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should be engulphed in the eddying wind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as here is penn'd doth always find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon the strange voice is upon the wane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the fair visitant at last unwound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the tradition of the gusty deep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now turn we to our former chroniclers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion awoke, that grief of hers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet paining on his ear: he sickly guess'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How lone he was once more, and sadly press'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His empty arms together, hung his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most forlorn upon that widow'd bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat silently. Love's madness he had known:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often with more than tortured lion's groan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moanings had burst from him; but now that rage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had pass'd away: no longer did he wage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lyre of his soul Eolian tun'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgot all violence, and but commun'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With melancholy thought: O he had swoon'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth was dove-like. Loth was he to move
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the imprinted couch, and when he did,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half seeing visions that might have dismay'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alecto's serpents; ravishments more keen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over eclipsing eyes: and at the last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every shape and size, even to the bulk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against an endless storm. Moreover too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to snort their streams. In this cool wonder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all his life: his youth, up to the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stept upon his shepherd throne: the look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his white palace in wild forest nook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the revels he had lorded there:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With every friend and fellow-woodlander
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass'd like a dream before him. Then the spur
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until into the earth's deep maw he rush'd:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all its buried magic, till it flush'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High with excessive love. "And now," thought he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long must I remain in jeopardy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of blank amazements that amaze no more?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have tasted her sweet soul to the core
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other depths are shallow: essences,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once spiritual, are like muddy lees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meant but to fertilize my earthly root,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make my branches lift a golden fruit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the bloom of heaven: other light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it be quick and sharp enough to blight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Olympian eagle's vision, is dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark as the parentage of chaos. Hark!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or they are but the ghosts, the dying swells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of noises far away? list!" Hereupon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept an anxious ear. The humming tone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came louder, and behold, there as he lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On either side outgush'd, with misty spray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copious spring; and both together dash'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving a trickling dew. At last they shot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of some breathless racers whose hopes poize
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the last few steps, and with spent force
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the ground they took a winding course.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion follow'd for it seem'd that one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever pursued, the other strove to shun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow'd their languid mazes, till well nigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had left thinking of the mystery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was now rapt in tender hoverings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the vanish'd bliss. Ah! what is it sings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dream away? What melodies are these?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sound as through the whispering of trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not native in such barren vaults. Give ear!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such tenderness as mine? Great Dian, why,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didst thou hear her prayer? O that I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were rippling round her dainty fairness now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circling about her waist, and striving how
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To entice her to a dive! then stealing in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between her luscious lips and eyelids thin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O that her shining hair was in the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I distilling from it thence to run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In amorous rillets down her shrinking form!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To linger on her lily shoulders, warm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between her kissing breasts, and every charm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch raptur'd! See how painfully I flow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair maid, be pitiful to my great woe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A happy wooer, to the flowery mead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all that beauty snar'd me." "Cruel god,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desist! or my offended mistress' nod
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will stagnate all thy fountains: tease me not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With syren words Ah, have I really got
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such power to madden thee? And is it true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away, away, or I shall dearly rue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My very thoughts: in mercy then away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindest Alpheus for should I obey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own dear will, 'twould be a deadly bane."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, Oread-Queen! would that thou hadst a pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like this of mine, then would I fearless turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be a criminal." "Alas, I burn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shudder gentle river, get thee hence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpheus! thou enchanter! every sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mine was once made perfect in these woods.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ever since I heedlessly did lave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thy deceitful stream, a panting glow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew strong within me: wherefore serve me so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And call it love? Alas, 'twas cruelty.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not once more did I close my happy eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the thrush's song. Away! Avaunt!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O 'twas a cruel thing." "Now thou dost taunt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So softly, Arethusa, that I think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou wast playing on my shady brink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wouldst bathe once again. Innocent maid!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stifle thine heart no more; nor be afraid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of angry powers: there are deities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will shade us with their wings. Those fitful sighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis almost death to hear: O let me pour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dewy balm upon them! fear no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Arethusa! Dian's self must feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes these very pangs. Dear maiden, steal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushing into my soul, and let us fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These dreary caverns for the open sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will delight thee all my winding course,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the green sea up to my hidden source
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Arcadian forests; and will shew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channels where my coolest waters flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through mossy rocks; where, 'mid exuberant green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I roam in pleasant darkness, more unseen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Saturn in his exile; where I brim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round flowery islands, and take thence a skim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mealy sweets, which myriads of bees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buzz from their honied wings: and thou shouldst please
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thyself to choose the richest, where we might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be incense-pillow'd every summer night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doff all sad fears, thou white deliciousness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let us be thus comforted; unless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry distracted from Sol's temperate beam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pour to death along some hungry sands."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do, Alpheus? Dian stands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe before me: persecuting fate!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhappy Arethusa! thou wast late
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huntress free in" At this, sudden fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those two sad streams adown a fearful dell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latmian listen'd, but he heard no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save echo, faint repeating o'er and o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Arethusa. On the verge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that dark gulph he wept, and said: "I urge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee, gentle Goddess of my pilgrimage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou art powerful, these lovers pains;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make them happy in some happy plains.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turn'd there was a whelming sound he stept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cooler light; and so he kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards it by a sandy path, and lo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More suddenly than doth a moment go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visions of the earth were gone and fled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the giant sea above his head.

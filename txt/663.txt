<p>A wind, bringing willow-cotton, sweetens the shop,<br> And a girl from Wu, pouring wine, urges me to share it.<br> With my comrades of the city who are here to see me off;<br> And as each of them drains his cup, I say to him in parting,<br> Oh, go and ask this river running to the east<br> If it can travel farther than a friend's love! <br></p>

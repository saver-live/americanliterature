<p>I hear the oriole's ever-mournful voice,<br> And welcome the rich summer's losses.<br> Through the grain, packed tightly ear on ear,<br> The sickle slices, with its snake's hiss.<br> <br> And the short skirts of the slim reapers,<br> Fly like festive flags in the breeze,<br> Now, the sound of bells would be joyful,<br> And a long gaze from under dusty lashes.<br> <br> It's not caresses I want, nor flattery,<br> In premonition of some pressing darkness,<br> But come with me and gaze at paradise,<br> Where we were innocent and blessed.<br></p>

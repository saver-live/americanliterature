No more auction block for me,
No more, no more;
No more auction block for me,
Many thousand gone.

No more peck of corn for me,
No more, no more;
No mroe peck of corn for me,
Many thousand gone.

No more driver's lash for me,
No more, no more;
No more driver's lash for me,
Many thousand gone.

No more pint o' salt for me,
No more, no more;
No more pint o' salt for me,
Many thousand gone.

No more hundred lash for me,
No more, no more;
No more hundred lash for me,
Many thousand gone.

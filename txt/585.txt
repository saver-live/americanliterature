<h2>I - About the Title</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>One of these nights, coming from the city to Engenho Novo, I found on the Central train a young man from the neighborhood, whom I know by sight and hat. He filled me, sat down beside me, spoke of the moon and the ministers, and ended up reciting verses to me. The journey was short, and the verses might not be entirely evil. It happened, however, that since I was tired, I closed my eyes three or four times; all it took was for him to stop reading and put the verses in his pocket. </p><p>"Go on," I said, nodding. </p><p>"I've finished," he murmured. </p><p>-They're very pretty. </p><p>I saw him make a gesture to pull them out of his pocket again, but it was not the gesture; he was pouting. The next day he came and said ugly names to me, and Dom Casmurro eventually came up to me. The neighbors, who do not like my quiet and quiet habits, gave way to the nickname, which they finally took. That's not why I got angry. I counted the anecdote to the friends of the city, and they, by grace, call me like this, some in tickets: "Dom Casmurro, Sunday I'm going to have dinner with you." "I'm going to Petropolis, Don Casmurro; the house is the same as Rhenania; see if you leave this cave of the Engenho Novo, and go there for a fortnight with me. "" My dear Dom Casmurro, do not worry that the dispensation of the theater tomorrow; come and sleep here in the city; I give him a cabin, I give him tea, I give him a bed; I just do not give you a girl. " </p><p>Do not consult dictionaries. Casmurro is not here in the sense that they give him, but in what the common man of a man is silent and met with. Dom came by ironically, to grant me fumes of a gentleman. All for being dozing! I also did not find a better title for my narration; if you do not have another one here until the end of the book, go this one. My poet on the train will know that I do not resent him. And with a little effort, being the title yours, you can take care that the work is yours. There are books that will only have this of their authors; some not so much.</p><h2>II - About the Book</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Now that I've explained the title, I'll start writing the book. Before that, though, let's say the reasons that put the penna in my hand. </p><p>I live alone, with a created one. The house in which I live is my own; fil-a to build purpose, taken from a desire so particular that vexa imprimil-o, but go there. One day, a few years ago, he reminded me to reproduce in the New Factory the house in which I grew up on the old street of Matacavallos, giving it the same appearance and economy as the other, which disappeared. Constructor and painter understood well the indications that I made them: it is the same estate built, three windows of front, balcony in the background, the same alcoves and rooms. In the main of these, the painting of the ceiling and walls is more or less similar, wreaths of small flowers and large birds that take them in the beaks, from space to space. In the four corners of the ceiling the figures of the seasons, and to the center of the walls the medallions of Cesar, Augusto, Nero and Massinissa, with the names below ... I can not reach the reason of these characters. When we went to Matacavallos's house, she was already decorated; came from the previous decade. Of course it was time taste metter taste classic and old figures in American paintings. The more is also analogous and similar. I have a henchman, flowers, vegetables, a casuarina, a well and a washing machine. Use old crockery and old furniture. In short, now, as elsewhere, there is the same contrast of the interior life, which is quiet, with the outside, which is noisy. </p><p>My obvious purpose was to tie the two ends of life together, and restore adolescence to old age. Well, sir, I could not make up what I was or what I was. In everything, if the face is equal, the physionomia is different. If only I were lacking the others, go; a man consoles himself more or less of the people he loses; but I miss myself, and this gap is everything. What is here is, barely comparing, similar to the painting that is put on the beard and hair, and which only preserves the external habit, as it is said in the autopsies; the inner can not take ink. A certificate that gave me twenty years of age could deceive strangers, like all false documents, but not me. The friends that I have left are of recent date; all the ancients went to study the geology of the holy fields. As for friends, some date fifteen years, others less, and almost all believe in youth. Two or three would believe them to others, but the language they speak requires a great deal of time to consult dictionaries, and such frequency is canker.</p><p>However, different life does not mean worse life; is another thing. In certain respects, this ancient life appears to me stripped of the many charms I have found; but it is also true that she lost a great deal of thorn that made her upset, and by memory I have some sweet and witchlike memory. In truth, I do not appear and speak least. Rare distractions. Most of the time is spent in gardening, gardening and reading; as well and do not sleep badly. </p><p>Now, how it all goes, this monotony has exhausted me too. It might vary, and it reminded me to write a book. Jurisprudence, philosophy and politics came to me, but the necessary forces did not come to me. Then I thought of making a History of the Suburbs, less dry than the memoirs of Father Luiz Gonçalves dos Santos, concerning the city; was a modest work, but it required documents and dates, as preliminaries, all arid and long. It was then that the busts painted on the walls began to speak to me and to tell me that, since they could not reconstruct my times, I would take the penna and count some of them. Perhaps the narration would give me the illusion, and the shadows would pass lightly, as to the poet, not the train, but that of Faust: Here you come again, restless shadows ...? </p><p>I was so happy with this idea, that even now I tremble the penna in the hand. Yes, Nero, Augustus, Massinissa, and you, great Cesar, who incites me to make my comments, I thank you for the advice, and I am going to put to the paper the reminiscences that come to me. In this way I will live what I have lived, and I will lay my hand on some work of greater volume. Let's begin the evocation for a famous November afternoon, which has never forgotten me. I had many more, better, and worse, but it never disappeared from my mind. That's what you'll understand, reading. </p><h2>III - The Complaint</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I was about to enter the drawing-room when I heard my name and hid behind the door. The house was on the street of Matacavallos, the month of November, the year is somewhat remote, but I will not change dates in my life just to please people who do not love old stories; the year was 1857. </p><p>-D. Gloria, do you persist in the idea of ​​getting our Bentinho to the seminary? It is more than time, and now there may be a difficulty. </p><p>-What difficulty? </p><p>"A great difficulty. </p><p>My mother wanted to know what it was. José Dias, after a few moments of concentration, came to see if there was anyone in the hallway; did not find me, came back and, muffling his voice, said that the difficulty was in the house at the foot, the people of Padua. </p><p>"The people of Padua?" </p><p>"I've been telling you this for some time, but I did not dare. I do not think it's nice that our little Bentinho is in the corners with the Turtle's daughter, and this is the difficulty, because if they get a date, you will have a lot to fight to separate them. </p><p>-I do not think so. Metrics in the corners? </p><p>"It's a way of speaking." In secrets, always together. Bentinho almost does not leave there. The little one is a fool; the father does not see; he would have taken things in such a way, that ... Understanding his gesture; you do not believe in such calculations, it seems to you that everyone has a candida soul ... </p><p>"But, Mr. Jose Dias, I've seen the little ones play, and I've never seen anything that makes you suspicious." It is enough; Bentinho is barely fifteen years old. Capitú made fourteen last week; are two creançolas. Do not forget that they were raised together, since that great flood, ten years ago, when the Padova family lost so much; from there came our relations. For will I believe ...? Mano Cosme, what do you think? </p><p>Uncle Cosme replied with a "Ora!" Which, translated as vulgar, meant: "These are the imaginations of José Dias; the little ones amuse themselves, I am amused; Where's backgammon? </p><p>"Yes, I believe you are mistaken." "You can be, my lady. May they be right; but believe that I did not speak until after much examination ... </p><p>"In any case, it's been a while," interrupted my mother; I'll try to meet you at the seminar as soon as possible. </p><p>"Well, since you have not lost the idea of ​​making him a priest, you have gained the principal. Bentinho must satisfy his mother's wishes. And then the Brazilian church has high destinies. Let us not forget that a bishop presided over the Constituent Assembly, and that Father Feijó ruled the empire ... </p><p>-God like him! said Uncle Cosme, yielding to old political grudges. </p><p>"Excuse me, Doctor, I'm not defending anyone, I'm quoting. What I want to say is that the clergy still have a big role in Brazil. </p><p>"You want a cloak; Go, get the backgammon. As for the little one, if you have to be a priest, you'd better not start saying mass until after the doors. But look here, sister Gloria, do you really need to be the priest? </p><p>"It is a promise, it must be fulfilled." </p><p>"I know you made a promise ... but, a promise like that ... I do not know ... I think, well thought... What do you think, cousin Justina?" </p><p>-I? </p><p>"It is true that each one knows best of himself," continued Uncle Cosimo; God knows all. However, a promise of so many years ... But, what is it, mana Gloria? Is crying? Come on! Is this a thing of tears? </p><p>My mother blew without answering. Prima Justina, I believe, got up and went to meet her. There was a loud silence, during which I was in a hurry to enter the room, but another force, another emotion ... I could not hear the words Uncle Cosme said. Prima Justina exhorted: "Prima Gloria! Gloria! "Jose Dias excused himself:" If I had known, I would not have spoken, but I spoke of veneration, of esteem, of affection, of fulfilling a bitter duty, a most loving duty ... " </p><h2>IV - A Most Loving Duty!</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>José Dias loved the superlatives. It was a way of giving monumentality to ideas; not having them, serve to prolong the phrases. He got up to fetch the backgammon, which was inside the house. I clung to the wall a lot, and I saw him pass in his white sticking trousers, loops, wheel, and tie. It was the last ones that used loops in Rio de Janeiro, and maybe in this world. She wore her slacks so that they would stretch out. His black satin tie, with a steel rim inside, immobilized his neck; it was fashionable then. The cheetah-bearer, dressed lightly, looked like a coat of ceremony. He was thin, sucked, with a bald head; he would be fifty-five years old. He rose with the slow pace of the custom, not wandering dragged from the lazy, but a calculated and deduced wandering, a complete syllogism, the premise before the consequence, the consequence before the conclusion. A most loving duty!</p><h2>V - The Aggregate</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>He did not always go at that slow and steady pace. He also decomposed into action, was very quick and quick in the movements, as natural as this way. Otherwise, he would laugh, if necessary, with a big, unwilling but communicative laugh, so much so that his cheeks, his teeth, his eyes, his whole face, the whole person, the whole world seemed to laugh at him. In serious bids, very serious. </p><p>He had been with us for many years; my father was still in the old Itaguahy farm, and I was just born. One day he appeared there, selling himself for a homeopathic doctor; carried a Manual and an apothecary. There was a flurry of fevers; Jose Dias cured the factor and a slave, and did not want to receive any remuneration. Then my father offered him to live there, with a small tidy. Jose Dias refused, saying that it was fair to bring health to the poor man's house. </p><p>"Who keeps you from going elsewhere?" Go where you want, but stay with us. </p><p>"I'll be back in three months." </p><p>He returned dalli to two weeks, he accepted house and food without other stipend, except what they wanted to give for parties. When my father was elected deputy and came to Rio de Janeiro with his family, he also came and had his room in the back of the chacara. One day, fevers reigning again in Itaguahy, my father told him to go and see our slavery. José Dias remained silent, sighed and ended up confessing that he was not a doctor. He had taken this title to help the propaganda of the new school, and he did not do it without studying much and much; but his conscience did not allow him to accept more sick people. </p><p>"But you healed the other times." </p><p>-I think so; the most correct, however, is to say that they were the remedies indicated in the books. They, yes, they, below God. I was a charlatan ... Do not deny it; the reasons for my procedure could be and were worthy; homeopathy is truth, and to lie to the truth I have lied; but it is time to restore everything. </p><p>He was not fired, as he asked; my father could no longer hold him. He had the gift of making himself necessary and necessary; was due to lack of it, as a family person. When my father died, the pain that struck him was enormous, they told me, I do not remember. My mother was very grateful to him, and would not let him leave the room of the chacara; On the seventh day, after Mass, he went to say goodbye to her. </p><p>Stay, José Dias. </p><p>"I obey you, my lady. </p><p>He had a small legacy in the testament, an apolice and four words of praise. He copied the words, fitted them in, and hung them in the bedroom over the bed. "This is the best apolice," he said. In time, he acquired some authority in the family, a certain audience, at least; he did not abuse, and he knew how to give his opinion. In the end, he was a friend, I will not say optimum, but not everything is optimal in this world. And do not suppose him a subaltern soul; the barbs he made came before the calculation of the indole. His clothes were very long; unlike the people who were quickly laying the new dress on, he had the old man brushed and smooth, cirzido, buttoned, of modest and poor elegance. It was read, as if it were an accident, enough to amuse the evening and the dessert, or explain some phenomena, to talk about the effects of heat and cold, the poles and Robespierre. He had often told of a trip he had made to Europe, and confessed that if it were not we, he would have returned there; had friends in Lisbon, but our family, he said, under God, was everything. </p><p>"Down or up?" asked Uncle Cosme one day. </p><p>"Down," repeated Jose Dias, full of veneration. </p><p>And my mother, who was religious, liked to see that he put God in the right place, and smiled approvingly. José Dias nodded his head. My mother gave him a few coppers from time to time. Uncle Cosme, who was a lawyer, trusted him to copy the papers. </p><h2>VI - Uncle Cosme</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Uncle Cosimo lived with my mother since she was widowed. Even then he was a widower, as cousin Justina; it was the house of the three widows. </p><p>Fortune often exchanges hands with nature. Formed into the serene func- tions of capitalism, Uncle Cosme did not enrich his father's diet. It had the escriptorio in the old street of Violas, near the jury, that was in the extinct Aljube. I was working on crime. José Dias did not miss Uncle Cosme's defenses. It was the one who dressed him and undressed his toga, with many lengths at the end. At home I referred to the debates. Uncle Cosimo, however modest he might be, smiled with persuasion. </p><p>He was fat and heavy, his breathing short, his eyes sleepy. One of my earliest memories was to ride every morning to the beast my mother gave him and to take him to the police station. The black man who had gone to fetch her from the stable, held the bridle while he lifted his foot and rested on the stirrup; to this followed a minute of rest or reflection. Then it gave an impulse, the first, the body threatening to rise, but it did not rise; second impulse, and such effect. At last, after a few moments, Uncle Cosme had swallowed all the physical and moral forces, gave the last outbreak of the earth, and this time it fell on the saddle. Rarely did the beast cease to show by a gesture that it had just received the world. Uncle Cosme accommodated the meat, and the beast trotted. </p><p>He also did not forget what he did to me one afternoon. Since I was born in the country (from whence I came with two years of age), and I did not know how to ride, I was afraid of the horse. Uncle Cosimo took me and scampered me on top of the beast. When I saw myself at the top (I was nine years old), alone and helpless, the floor below me, I cried desperately: </p><p>"Mama! Mother! "She came pallid and trembling, made sure that they were killing me, got out of bed, and told me, while her brother asked, </p><p>"Mama Gloria, why are a number of these afraid of a small beast?" </p><p>"You're not used to it." </p><p>-You should get used to it. Father, if he be a vicar in the field, he must mount his horse; and, even here, not being a priest, if you want to flourish like the other boys, and do not know, you have to complain about yourself, sister Gloria. </p><p>"Well, complain; I'm afraid. </p><p>-Fear! Why, fear! </p><p>The truth is that I only came to learn riding later, less by taste than by shame of saying that I did not know how to ride. "Now he's going to date devas," they said when I started the licenses. Uncle Cosme would not have said the same thing. Nelle was old custom and need. I was not dating anymore. They say that, as a boy, he was accosted by many ladies, as well as an exalted partisan; but the years took him the most of the political and sexual ardor, and the fat finished with the rest of public and specific ideas. Now he only obeyed the obligations of the officio and without love. In the hours of leisure he lived watching or playing. One time or another he would say pillows. </p><h2>VII - D. Gloria</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>My mother was a good creature. When her husband, Pedro de Albuquerque Santiago, died, she was thirty-one years old, and could return to Itaguahy. No quiz; he preferred to be near the church where my father had been buried. He sold the hacienda and the slaves, bought some that he had earned or rented, a dozen buildings, a certain number of apolices, and left himself at the house of Matacavallos, where he had lived the last two years of his marriage. She was the daughter of a lady from Minas Gerais, a descendant of another paulista, the Fernandes family. </p><p>Now, in that year of the grace of 1857, D. Maria da Gloria Fernandes Santiago had forty-two years of age. She was still pretty and young, but she insisted on hiding the balances of youth, however much nature might preserve her from the action of time. She was immersed in an eternal dark dress, unadorned, with a black chandelier, folded in triangle and buckled to the breast by a cameo. The hair, in bandos, was caught on the back of an old turtle's comb; He was always wearing a white bonnet. He read like this, in his shod and deaf corduroy shoes, on one side and another, seeing and guiding the services of the whole house from morning till night. </p><p>I have on the wall the portrait of her, next to her husband, in the other house. The painting has darkened a lot, but it still gives an idea of ​​both. It reminds me nothing of him, except that he was loosely tall and wore a large club; the portrait shows round eyes, which accompany me everywhere, the effect of the painting that haunted me in small. The neck leaves a black tie with many turns, the face is all shaved, except for a little bit caught in the ears. My mother's shows that she was beautiful. He was twenty years old, and had a flower between his fingers. In the panel it seems to offer to her husband. What is said in the face of both is that if conjugal happiness could be compared to great luck, they took it out on the ticket bought from society.</p><p>I conclude that lotteries should not be abolished. No prizewinner accused them of immorality, as no one badly punched Pandora's cunt for having taken hope in the background; Somewhere she has to stay. Here I have the two well-married formerly, the well-loved, the blessed, who have gone from this to the afterlife, to continue a dream probably. When the lottery and Pandora annoy me, I look up at them, and I forget the white tickets and the fake cunt. They are pictures that are worth by origins. My mother's, stretching out to her husband, seems to say: "I'm all yours, my handsome gentleman!" My father's, looking at us, makes this comment: "Look how this girl wants me ..." suffered discomfort, I do not know, as I do not know if they had dislikes: it was a growth and I started not being born. After her death, she reminds me that she cried a lot; but here are the pictures of both, without the grimy of time taking their first expression. They are like instantaneous photographs of happiness. </p><h2>VIII - It's Time</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>But it is time to take that November afternoon, a clear and fresh afternoon, as still as our house and the stretch of the street where we were living. Truly was the beginning of my life; all that had happened before was how to paint and dress the people who had to enter the scene, the lights accent, the fiddle preparation, the symphonia ... Now I was going to start my opera. "Life is an opera," an old Italian tenor told me, who lived and died here ... And he explained the definition to me one day, in such a way that he made me believe it. Maybe it's worth dal-a; It's just a chapter. </p><h2>IX - An Opera</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>He no longer had a voice, but he insisted that he had it. "The disuse is what makes me bad," he added. Whenever a new company arrived from Europe, it went to the impresario and exposed him to all the injustices of the earth and the sky; the businessman committeth another, and he went out to cry out against iniquity. He still had the mustaches on his papers. When he walked, he looked like an old man, he seemed to woo a Babylonian princess. Sometimes he would hum, without opening the mouth, some part even more so than he or so; Voices thus muffled are always possible. I came here for dinner with me a few times. One night, after much Chianti, he repeated to me the definition of custom, and as I told him that life could be such an opera, as a sea voyage or a battle, he shook his head and replied, </p><p>"Life is an opera and a great opera. The tenor and the barytono fight for the soprano, in the presence of the bass and the comprimarios, when they are not the soprano and the contralto that fight by the tenor, in presence of the same bass and the same comprimarios. Ha are numerous, many ballets, and the orchestration is excellent ... </p><p>"But, my dear Marcolini ..." </p><p>-What...? </p><p>And after sipping a drink of liquor, he put down the calix, and exposed the history of creation, with words that I shall sum up. </p><p>God is the poet. The music is of Satanaz, young maestro of much future, that apprendido in the conservatory of the sky. Rival de Miguel, Raphael and Gabriel, did not tolerate the precedence that they had in the distribution of the prizes. It could also be that the music in too sweet and mystical of those other condiscipulos was abhorrent to its essentially tragic genius. He struck a rebellion that was discovered in time, and he was expelled from the conservatory. Everything would have passed without anything else, if God had not written a libretto of opera, which he had given up, to understand that such a genre of recreation was improper of its eternity. Satan took the manuscript with me to hell. In order to show that he was worth more than the others, -and perhaps to reconcile himself with the composer-the score, and as soon as it was finished, he was taken to the Eternal Father. </p><p>"Sir, I have not unpaid the licenses received," he said. Here you have the score, listen to it, amend it, make it perform, and if you find it worthy of the heights, I allowed myself with it at your feet ... </p><p>"No," replied the Lord, "I do not want to hear anything. </p><p>"But, Lord ..." </p><p>-Anything! anything! </p><p>Satan supplicated, without better fortune, until God, weary and full of mercy, consented that the opera be performed, but it was from heaven. He created a special theatro, this planet, and invented an entire company, with all parts, primaries and comprimarias, comedians and dancers. </p><p>"I've heard a few rehearsals!" </p><p>"No, I do not want to know about rehearsals. It is enough for me to have composed the libretto; I'm ready to share the copyright with you. </p><p>It was perhaps an evil this refusal; This led to some disconcerts which the prior audience and friendly collaboration would have avoided. As a matter of fact, there is a place where the verse goes to the right and the song to the left. There is no shortage of people who say that in this very thing is the beauty of the composition, fleeing monotony, and so explain the Tettotus of Eden, the aria of Abel, the courts of the guillotine and slavery. It is not uncommon for the same bids to reproduce without sufficient reason. Certain motives abound with the force of repetition. There are also obscurities; the maestro abuses the weeping masses, often masking the meaning in a confused way. The orchestra parts are treated with great skill. Such is the opinion of the impartials. </p><p>The master's friends want it so difficult to find such a well-finished work. One or the other admits certain rudeness and such or such gaps, but with the gait of the opera it is probable that these are fulfilled or explained, and those disappear entirely, not refusing the master to amend the work where he thinks he does not respond at all to the thought sublime of the poet. Friends of this one no longer say the same. They swear that the libretto was sacrificed, that the score corrupted the meaning of the letter, and, since it is beautiful in some places, and worked with art in others, it is absolutely different and even contrary to the drama. The grotesque, for example, is not in the poet's text; is an excrescence to imitate the Merry Wives of Windsor. This point is disputed by Satanists with some apparent reason. They are told that, at the time when young Satan composed the great opera, neither this fake nor Shakespeare were born. They even affirm that the English poet had no other genius than to transcribe the letter of the opera with such art and fidelity that he seems to himself the author of the composition; but of course he is a plagiarist. </p><p>This piece," concluded the old tenor, "will last as long as the theater lasts, and it will not be possible to calculate at what time it will be demolished by astronomical utility. Success is increasing. Poet and musician receive their authoritative rights punctually, which are not the same, because the rule of division is that of the Scripture: "Many are called, few chosen." God receives in gold, Satanaz in paper. </p><p>-It's funny... </p><p>-Grace? he cried with fury; but he quieted at once, and replied, "Dear James, I am not amused; I am a horror of grace. What I say is pure and ultimate truth. One day, when all the books are burned for unfaithfulness, there must be someone, maybe tenor, and perhaps Italian, who teaches this truth to men. Everything is music, my friend. In the beginning it was the do, and the do was made back, etc. </p><p>This calix (and filled it again) this calix is ​​a brief refrain. Do not you hear? Also you can not hear the stick or the stone, but everything fits in the same opera ... </p><h2>X - I Accept a Theory</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>That is too metaphysical for a single tenor, there is no doubt; but the loss of voice explains everything, and there are philosophers who are, in short, unemployed tenors. </p><p>I, my dear reader, accept the theoria of my old Marcolini, not only for the verisimilitude, which is very much the whole truth, but because my life fits well with the definition. I sang a ternissimo duo, then a trio, then a quatuor ... But let's not go; Let's go the first afternoon, when I came to know that I was already singing, because the denunciation of José Dias, my dear reader, was mainly given to me. It is he who denounced me.</p><h2>XI - A Promise</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>As soon as I saw the guest in the corridor disappear, I left the hiding place, and ran to the back porch. He did not want to know about tears or the cause that made them shed my mother. The cause was probably his ecclesiastical projects, and the occasion of these is what I am going to say, because it is already an old history; he was seventeen years old. </p><p>The projects came from the time I was conceived. When the first child was born to him, my mother took up his life with God, so that the second one might take revenge, if he were a man, he would take him to the church. Maybe he was expecting a girl. I said nothing to my father, neither before nor after giving birth to me; I would tell him when I went to school, but he was widowed before that. He saw, he was afraid to part with me; but she was so devout, so godly, that she sought witnesses of the obligation, trusting the promise to relatives and relatives. Only, in order to separate as late as possible, he made me take home the first letters, Latin and doctrine, by that Father Cabral, an old friend of Uncle Cosme, who was going to play there in the evenings. </p><p>Long terms are easy to subscribe; imagination makes them infinite. My mother waited for the years to come. However, I was liking the idea of ​​the church; earrings of growth, devout books, images of saints, house conversations, all converged on the altar. When we went to mass, he always told me that it was to apprender to be a priest, and that he noticed the priest, did not take the eyes of the priest. At home, I played at Mass, -a bit in secret, because my mother said that Mass was not a joke. We'd get an altar, Capitú and me. She served as a sacristan, and we altered the ritual, in the sense of dividing the host between us; the host was always sweet. In the time when we used to play like this, it was very common to hear my neighbor say: "Today is Mass?" I already knew what this meant, I would say affirmatively, and I would ask for a name for another. He would return with her, we would get the altar, we would swap the Latin and we would precipitate the ceremonies. Dominus, non sum dignus ... This, which I should say three times, I think I said only one, such was the golodice of the priest and the sacristan. We drank neither wine nor water; we did not have the first, and the second came to take away the taste of sacrifice. </p><p>Lately, they had not told me about the seminary, so much so that I supposed it to be an endless business. For fifteen years, when there was no vocation, they asked the seminary of the world rather than St. Joseph's. My mother would look at me as a lost soul for a long time, or take my hand, under the pretext of nothing, to open it much. </p><h2>XII - On the Balcony</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I stopped on the porch; I went dizzy, stunned, my legs were wobbly, my heart seemed to want to get out of my mouth. I did not dare go down to the chacara, and go to the little yard. I started pacing back and forth, stooping to patronize myself, and walked again and stopped. Confused voices repeated José </p><p>Dias's speech: </p><p>"Always together..." </p><p>«In Secrets ...» </p><p>«If they get a date ...» </p><p>Bricks that I stepped on that afternoon, yellowed columns that you passed me to the right or left, as I went or came, in you I had the best part of the crisis, the sensation of a new gossip, that involved me in myself, and soon dispersed me, and brought me shivers, and I spilled do not know what inner balsamo. Sometimes I smiled, an air of laughter of satisfaction that belied the abomination of my sin. And the voices echoed in confusion: </p><p>«In Secrets ...» </p><p>"Always together..." </p><p>«If they get a date ...» </p><p>A coconut tree, seeing me restless and guessing at the cause, whispered to himself that it was not ugly for fifteen-year-olds to walk in the corners with the girls of fourteen; on the contrary, the adolescents of that age did not have another officio, nor the songs any other utility. It was an old coconut tree, and I believe in the old coconut trees, even more so than in the old books. Birds, butterflies, a cicada that rehearsed the summer, all the people living in the air were of the same opinion. </p><p>How then did I love Capitú, and Capitú to me? Really, I was sewn to her skirts, but nothing happened between us that was secret. Before she went to college, they were all mischief; after he left the college, it is certain that we did not immediately reestablish the former intimacy, but it came back little by little, and in the last year it was complete. However, the subject of our conversations was as usual. Capitú called me sometimes handsome, mocetão, a flower; others would take my hands and count my fingers. And I began to remember these and other gestures and words, the pleasure I felt when she ran her hand through my hair, saying that I thought they were beautiful. I, without doing the same to the della, said that the della were much more beautiful than mine. Then Capitú was shaking his head with a great expression of disappointment and melancholy, all the more surprising as his hair was really admirable; but I retort calling him crazy. When I asked myself if I had dreamed of her in the evening, and I said no, I heard her tell me that she had dreamed about me, and it was extraordinary adventures, that we climbed Corcovado by the air, that we were on the moon, or that the angels came to ask us by the names, in order to give them to other angels who had just been born. In all these dreams we were together. The ones I had with her were not like that, they just reproduced our familiarity, and very often they were just the repetition of the day, some phrase, some gesture. I counted them, too. Capitú one day noticed the difference, saying that the della were more beautiful than mine; I, after some hesitation, told him that they were like the person who dreamed ... He made himself a pitanga. </p><p>For, frankly, I only now understood the emotion these and other confidences gave me. The emotion was sweet and new, but the cause of it ran away, without my searching or suspecting it. The silences of the last days, which did not discover anything to me, now felt them as signs of something, and so the half words, the curious questions, the vague answers, the care, the taste of remembering the childhood. I also warned that it was a recent phenomenon to accord with the thought in Capitú, and to listen to it by heart, and to shudder when I heard the footsteps. If it was spoken of in my house, it was more distant than before, and, according to praise or criticism, it brought me more intense taste or disgust than before, when we were only companions of mischief. I came to think of it during the masses of that month, with intervals, it is true, but with exclusiveness as well. </p><p>All this was now presented to me by the mouth of Jose Dias, who had denounced myself, and to whom I forgave everything, the evil I had said, the evil I had done, and what could come from one and the other. At that moment, the eternal Truth was worth no more than him, nor eternal Goodness, nor the other eternal Virtues. He loved Capitú! Capitú loved me! And my legs were walking, turning, staking, trembling and believing to embrace the world. This first palpitation of the sap, this revelation of self-consciousness, has never forgotten me again, nor did I find any other sensation of the same species comparable to it. Of course for being mine. Naturally also for being the first.</p><h2>XIII - Capitú</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, I heard a voice cry from within the house on foot:</p><p>-Capitú!</p><p>And in the yard:</p><p>-Mom!</p><p>And again in the house:</p><p>-Come here!</p><p>I could not have it. My legs went down the three steps that led to the chacara, and they walked to the little yard. It was their custom, in the evenings, and in the mornings too. That the legs are also people, only inside the arms, and are worth of themselves, when the head does not govern them by means of ideas. Mine arrived at the foot of the wall. There was a communication door there torn up by my mother, when Capitú and I were small. The door had no key and no taramela, it opened by pushing on one side or pulling on another, and closed the weight of a stone hanging from a rope. It was almost exclusively ours. In creancas, we made a visit knocking on one side, and being received from the other with many gestures. When the dolls of Capitú got sick, the doctor was me. He entered the backyard of the house with a stick under his arm, to imitate Dr. João da Costa's bengal; took his wrist and told him to show his tongue. "She's deaf, poor thing!" Exclaimed Capitú. Then I scratched my chin, like the doctor, and ended up ordering some bloodsucking or giving him a vomit: it was the doctor's usual therapeutics.</p><p>-Capitú!</p><p>-Mom!</p><p>"Stop busting the wall; come here.</p><p>Her mother's voice was now closer, as if from the back door. Quiz to go to the yard, but the legs, so little walkers, now seemed stuck to the ground. At last I made an effort, pushed open the door, and entered. Capitú stood at the foot of the front wall, facing him, scratching with a nail. The murmur of the door was looking back; when he came with me, he leaned against the wall, as if to conceal something. I walked for her; of course the gesture changed, because she came to me, and asked me uneasily:</p><p>-What do you have?</p><p>-I? Anything.</p><p>-Nothing; You have something.</p><p>Maybe insist that nothing, but not find language. All of me was eyes and heart, a heart that was going to come out, sure, out of the mouth. She could not take her eyes off the fourteen-year-old creature, tall, strong and full, clutched in a faded calico dress. The thick hair, made in two braids, with the ends tied to one another, in the fashion of time, came down his back. Brunette, big, clear eyes, straight, long nose, her mouth was thin and her chin was broad. The hands, despite some rough offices, were healed with love; they did not smell like fine soaps or toilet waters, but with common well water and soap they brought them without macula. She wore long, shallow, old shoes, which she had given herself a few stitches.</p><p>-What do you have? he repeated.</p><p>"It's nothing," I finally mumbled.</p><p>And I soon said:</p><p>"It's news.</p><p>-Notice of what?</p><p>I thought I would tell him that I was going to go into the seminary and stare at the impression he would make. If I shocked her, she really liked me; if not, he did not like it. But all this calculation was obscure and quick; I felt I could not speak clearly, I had now the view I do not know how ...</p><p>-So?</p><p>-Do you know...</p><p>In this I looked at the wall, the place where she had been scratching, writing or biting, as her mother had said. I saw some open scratches, and he reminded me of the gesture she had made to keep them busy. So I asked them to come close, and I took a step. Capitú grabbed me, but either because I feared that I would run away, or because I would deny otherwise, he ran ahead and erased the script. It was the same as adding to me the desire to read what it was.</p><h2>XIV - The Inscription</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Everything I said at the end of the other chapter was the work of an instant. What followed was even faster. I jumped, and before she scraped the wall, I read these two names, open to the nail, so arranged:</p><p>Benedict</p><p>CAPITOLINE</p><p>I turned to her; Capitú had his eyes on the ground. He lifted them up, slowly, and we looked at one another ... Confession of children, you were well worth two or three pages, but I want to be spared. Verily, we have not spoken; the wall spoke for us. We do not move, the hands are stretched out little by little, all four, catching themselves, squeezing, merging. I did not mark the exact time of that gesture. I should have dialed it; I miss the writing on that night, and I would put it here with the errors of orthography that I brought, but I would not have any, such was the difference between the student and the teenager. He knew the rules of writing without suspecting those of love; she had orgies of Latin and was a virgin of women.</p><p>We did not let go of their hands, nor did they let themselves fall from canker or forgotten. The eyes were looking and disemboweled, and after wandering about, they met again for each other ... A future priest, he was like that of an altar, one side of which is Epistola and the other the face. Gospel. The mouth could be the calix, the lips paten. It was not necessary to say the new Mass, for a Latin that no one understands, and it is the Catholic language of men. Do not think me sacrilegious, my devout reader; the cleansing of the intention washes whatever may be less curious in the stalk. We were there with the sky in us. The hands, joining the nerves, made the two creatures one, but one seraphic creature. The eyes continued to say infinite things, the words of bocca was that they did not even try to leave, they made the heart as silent as they came ...</p><h2>XV - Another Sudden Voice</h2><p> </p><p> Another sudden voice, but this time a man's voice: </p><p>"Are you playing politics?" </p><p>It was Capitu's mother, who was at the back door, at the woman's feet. We let our hands go quickly, and we were in the way. Capitú went to the wall, and with the nail, covertly erased our names. </p><p>-Capitú! </p><p>-Papae! </p><p>"Do not ruin the plaster of the wall." Capitú scratched on the scratch, to erase the script. Padova went out into the yard, to see what it was, but her daughter had begun another thing, a profile, which she said was the portrait of him, and it could be as well as his mother; I laughed, that was the point. Besides, he arrived without a chuckle, all sweet, despite the dubious or less than doubtful gesture in which he caught us. He was a short, thick man, short legs and arms, abyss backs, whence came the nickname of Turtle, which Jose Dias gave him. No one called him back home; it was only the aggregate. </p><p>"Were you playing politics?" He asked. </p><p>I looked at a foot of the elder who was near; Capitú answered for both. </p><p>"We were, yes, sir, but Bentinho laughs, he can not bear it. </p><p>"When I got to the door, do not laugh. </p><p>"I've laughed at the other times; can not. Papae wants to see? </p><p>And seriously, she looked into my eyes, inviting me to play. The scare is naturally serious; I was still under the action of what brought the entrance to Padua, and I was not able to laugh, no matter how much I should do it, to legitimate Capitú's answer. This, tired of waiting, she turned away, saying that I did not laugh that time because I was at the foot of the pae. And he did not even laugh. There are things that only apprehend late; It is necessary to be born with them to make them early. And it is better of course early than artificially late. Capitú, after two turns, went to his mother, who was still at the door of the house, leaving us and her mother delighted; the pae, looking at her and me, said to me, full of tenderness: </p><p>"Who will say that this little girl is fourteen years old?" Looks like this. Is Mommy good? he kept turning fully to me. </p><p>-It is. </p><p>"I have not seen her for many days. I want to give a capote to the doctor, but I have not been able to, I work with the distribution office, at home; I write every night that it is in despair; business report. Have you seen my gumbomo? It's in the background. I was about to fetch the cage; go see That my desire was none, it is easily believed, without having to swear by the sky or the earth. My desire was to go after Capitú and tell him now of the evil that awaited us, but the father was the father, and the rest loved the little birds. It had them of varying species, color and size. The area that was in the center of the house was surrounded by cages of canaries, which they sang with a noise of all the devils. He traded birds with other amateurs, bought them, picked up some, in his own yard, setting up trapdoors. Also, if they get sick, treat them as if they were people. </p><h2>XVI - The Interim Administrator</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Padova was employed in a division dependent on the ministry of war. She did not earn much, but the woman spent little, and life was cheap. Moreover, the house in which he lived, as our own, as a minor, was his property. He bought it with the great luck that came to him in a half lottery ticket, ten short stories of kings. The first idea of ​​Padova, when it won him the prize, was to buy a cavallo from the Cape, a brilliant vest for his wife, a perpetual family grave, send some birds from Europe, etc .; but the woman, this Fortunata, who is standing at the back door of the house, talking to her daughter, tall, strong, full, like her daughter, the same head, the same clear eyes, the woman who told her that it was better to buy the house, and to keep what was left to go to great trouble. Padua hesitated a great deal; after all, had to yield to the advice of my mother, whom D. Fortunata asked for help. Nor was it only on this occasion that my mother paid them; one day came to save the life of Padova. Listen; the anecdote is short.</p><p>The administrator of the division where Padua worked had to go to the North in commission. Padua, or by regulatory order, or by special designation, has replaced the administrator with the respective fees. This change of fortune brought a certain vertigo to him: it was before the ten contos. He did not content himself with reforming his clothes and his canopy, he threw himself into superfluous expenses, gave the woman jewels, and on feast days he killed a piglet, was seen in theaters, and came to the polished shoes. He lived like this twenty-two months in the supposition of an eternal inter- nity. One afternoon he entered our house, afflicted and in a frenzy, he was going to miss the place, because he had arrived on that morning. He asked my mother to watch over the unfortunates she left behind; he could not suffer the misfortune, he would kill himself. My mother spoke kindly to him, but he did not attend to anything.</p><p>"No, my lady, I will not consent to such shame!" To bring down the family, to make up ... I said, I kill myself! I will not confess this misery to my people. And the others? What will the neighbors say? And the friends? And the public?</p><p>-What do I publish, Mr. Padua? Leave it alone; be a man. Remember that your wife has no other person ... and what to do? For a man ... Be a man, walk.</p><p>Padua wiped his eyes and went home, where he lay prostrate for a few days, mute, locked in the alcove, or in the yard at the bottom of the well, as if the idea of ​​death lingered on him. D. Fortunata scolded:</p><p>-João, are you a child?</p><p>But she heard him speak so much that she was afraid, and one day she ran to ask my mother to do her favor to see if her husband would be saved if she wanted to kill herself. My mother hired him at the edge of the well, and told him to live. How crazy was it to look like he was going to be disgraced, because of less gratification, and lose an interim job? No, sir, he ought to be a man, family member, to imitate his wife and daughter ... Padua obeyed; he confessed that he would find the strength to do my mother's will.</p><p>"My will, no; it is your obligation.</p><p>"Well, it's an obligation; I do not know it's the way it is.</p><p>In the following days, he continued to enter and leave the house, sewn to the wall, face to the floor. It was not the same man who spoiled his hat in courting the neighborhood, smiling, eyes in the air, even before the interim administration. The weeks came, the wound healed. Padua began to take an interest in domestic affairs, to take care of the birds, to sleep quietly in the evenings and in the evenings, to talk and to give news of the street. The serenity returned; Atraz della saw the joy, one Sunday, in the figure of two friends, who were going to play the ground, to try. Already he was laughing, already playing, had the air of custom; the wound healed of everything.</p><p>Over time there came an interesting phenomenon. Padua began to speak of the interim administration, not only without the regrets of honoraria, nor the vexation of loss, but even with faintness and pride. The administration remained at Hegyra, where he counted both before and after.</p><p>"At the time I was an administrator ..."</p><p>Or else:</p><p>-Oh! yes, remember me, it was before my administration, one or two months before ... Now wait; My administration has begun ... It is this, a month and a half before; It was mez and a half before, it was not longer.</p><p>Or yet:</p><p>"Rightly so; there were six months already that I administered ...</p><p>Such is the posthumous flavor of interim glories. José Dias cried that it was the vanity that survived; but Father Cabral, who carried everything to Escriptura, said that with Padova he was given the license of Eliphaz to Job: "Do not despise the correction of the Lord; he wounds and heals. "</p><h2>XVII - The Worms</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>"It hurts and heals!" When, later on, I learned that Achilles' spear had also healed a wound he had done, I had the pleasure or the pleasure of writing a dissertation for this purpose. I got to pick up old books, dead books, buried books, in April, to compare them, silencing the text and meaning, to find the common origin of pagan oracle and Israeli thought. I picked up the worms from the books, so that they would tell me what was in the texts gnawed by them. </p><p>"My lord," answered a long fat worm, "we know absolutely nothing of the texts we gnaw, nor choose what we gnaw, neither love nor hate what we gnaw; we gnaw. </p><p>I did not start anything else. The others all, as if they had passed word, repelled the same song. Perhaps this discreet silence over the roasted texts was still a way of gnawing the roast. </p><h2>XVIII - A Plan</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Pae and mother did not come to us, when Capitú and I, in the parlor, were talking about the seminary. With my eyes on me, Capitú wanted to know what news I was so struck with. When I told him what it was, he made himself cry.</p><p>-But I do not want to, I go soon, I do not want to go to seminars; I do not go in, it's excused to be with me, I do not go in.</p><p>Capitú, he did not say anything at first. He gathered his eyes, brought them to himself, and allowed himself to be with the vacant, deaf pupillas, his mouth open, all still. So I, to give strength to the affirmations, began to swear that I would not be a priest. At that time he swore very hard, for life and for death. I swore by the hour of death. May the light fail me at the hour of death if I went to the seminary. Capitú did not seem to believe or disbelieve, he did not seem to even hear; was a stick figure. Quiz chamal-a, shake it, but it missed me cheer up. This creature who had played with me, who had jumped, dansára, I believe until he had slept with me, left me now with arms tied and fearful. At last he returned to himself, but his face was livid, and he broke into these angry words:</p><p>-Beat! Carola! potato mastiff!</p><p>I was stunned. Capitú was so fond of my mother, and my mother della, that I could not understand such an explosion. It is true that he also liked me, and of course more, or rather, or rather, much to explain the spite that brought him the threat of separation; but the insults, how to understand that he called her names so ugly, and especially to depress religious customs, which were his? That she too went to mass, and three or four times my mother took her to our old house. He had also given her a rosary, a gold cross, and a book of Hours... Perhaps he defended her, but Capitú did not leave me, he continued to call her blessed and carola, in a voice so loud that I was afraid to be heard by the parents. I've never seen her so angry; seemed inclined to say everything to everyone. He would close his teeth, shake his head ... I, scared, did not know what to do; repeated the oaths, promised to go that very night to declare at home that, for nothing in this world, he would enter the seminary.</p><p>-You? You enter.</p><p>- I'm not coming in.</p><p>"You'll see if he comes in or not."</p><p>He paused again. When he spoke again, he had changed; it was not even the usual Capitú, but almost. He was serious, without affliction, he spoke quietly. Maybe I know the conversation in my house; I told her everything except the part that concerned her.</p><p>"And what interest does José Dias have in remembering this?" he asked me in the end.</p><p>-I think none; it was only to do evil. He is a very bad fellow; but, let me be. When I am the owner of the house, whoever goes to the street is him, you will see; I do not stay for an instant. Mom is too good; it gives you extra attention. It seems she even cried.</p><p>-José Dias?</p><p>"No, Mother.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>-Do not know; I only heard that she did not cry, that it was not a crying thing.... She was repentant and went away; I then, to avoid being caught, I left the corner and ran to the porch. But, let it be, that he pays me!</p><p>I said this by clenching my fist, and uttered other threats. As I recall them, I do not think it is ridiculous; adolescence and childhood are not at this point ridiculous; and one of its privileges. This evil or this danger begins in youth, grows in the madurera and attains the greatest grain in old age. At the age of fifteen, there is even a certain grace to threaten much and not to do anything.</p><p>Capitú reflected. Reflection was not uncommon in her, and occasion was known by the tightness of her eyes. He asked me for a few more circumstances, the words of each other, and the tone of them. Since I did not want to say the starting point of the conversation, which was itself, I could not give it any meaning. The attention of Capitú was now particularly on my mother's tears; he did not quite understand them. In the midst of this, he confessed that it was certainly not evil that my mother wanted to make me a priest; was the old promise, which she, God-fearing, could not fail to fulfill. I was so pleased to see that he so spontaneously repaired the insults that came from his chest shortly before I took it from her hand and squeezed it. Capitú let himself go, laughing; then the conversation went to doze and sleep. We had arrived at the window; a black man, who had been proclaiming coconut for some time, stopped in front and asked:</p><p>"Little sister, what's cooking today?"</p><p>"No," said Captain.</p><p>- That's good.</p><p>"Go away," she replied nonchalantly.</p><p>"Give it!" I said, lowering my arm for two.</p><p>I bought them, but I had to eat them alone; Capitú refused. I saw that in the midst of the crisis I kept a corner for the cocadas, which could be both perfection and imperfection, but the moment is not for such definitions; let's face it, that my friend, who was well balanced and lucid, did not want to know about candy, and she was very fond of candy. On the contrary, the proclamation that black was singing, the prégon of the old afternoons, so familiar with the neighborhood and our childhood:</p><p>Cry, girl, cry,</p><p>Cry because you do not have</p><p>Come,</p><p>so as to leave him with an annoyed impression, Of the toada was not; she knew it from the distance and from the distance, she used it in our childish games, laughing, jumping, changing roles with me, sometimes selling, or buying an absent candy. I believe that the letter, intended to sting the children's vanity, was that it angered her now, because soon she told me:</p><p>"If I were rich, you would run away, get in the pack and go to Europe."</p><p>Having said that, he looked at me, but I believe they did not tell him anything, or just thanked him for his good intentions. Indeed, the feeling was so friendly that I could excuse the extraordinary of the adventure.</p><p>As you can see, at the age of fourteen, Capitú had bold ideas, much less than others that came later; but they were only daring in themselves, in practice they became habeis, sinuous, deaf, and reached the proposed end, not of jumping, but of the bumps. I do not know if I explain myself well. It supposes a large conception executed by small means. So if I could not get out of the vague and hypothetical desire to send me to Europe, Captain, if I could carry it out, he would not have me embark on the package and flee; I would extend a line of canoes from here to there, where I, seeming to go to the fortress of Lage on a quick bridge, would actually go to Bordéos, leaving my mother on the beach, waiting. Such was the particular feature of my friend's character; so it is no wonder that, fighting my plans of frank resistance, it was rather by the mild means, by the action of commitment, by the word, by the slow and daily persuasion, and to examine first the people with whom we could count. Uncle Cosimo snapped; it was a "good life"; if I did not approve of my ordination, I could not take a step to suspend it. Prima Justina was better than him, and better than the two would be Father Cabral, by authority, but the priest was not to work against the church; only if I confessed that I had no vocation ....</p><p>"Can I confess?"</p><p>"Well, yes, but it would be straightforward, and the best is another." José Dias ....</p><p>-What about José Dias?</p><p>-lt can be a good effort.</p><p>-But if it was he who spoke ...</p><p>"It does not matter," continued Capitú; will now say another thing. Elle likes you very much. Do not tell him shy. All is that you are not afraid, show that you have to become the owner of the house, show that you want and that you can. Let him well understand that it is not favor. Make him praise too; He is very fond of being praised. D. Gloria pays attention to him; but the main thing is not this; is that he, having to serve you, will speak with much more heat than another.</p><p>-I do not think so. No, Capitú.</p><p>"Then go to the seminary."</p><p>-Not that.</p><p>-But what do you miss in trying? Let's try; Do as I tell you. D. Gloria might change resolution; if it does not change, another thing is done, then Father Cabral will be put in. " Do not you remember how you went to theatro for the first time, two months ago? D. Gloria did not want to, and that was enough for José Dias not to be stubborn; but he wanted to go, and made a speech, remember?</p><p>"Remind me; said that the theater was a school of customs.</p><p>-Fair; both said that his mother finally consented, and paid the entrance to the two .... Go, ask, send. Look; tell him that he is going to study law in Sao Paulo.</p><p>I shuddered with pleasure. St. Paul was a fragile screen, destined to be wiped out one day, instead of the thick spiritual and eternal wall. Prometti to speak to José Dias in the proposed terms. Capitú repeated them, accentuating some, as princes; and then inquired about them, to see if he understood well, if he had not exchanged for each other. And he insisted that I ask him with a good face, but like someone who asks for a glass of water, the person who is obliged to bring it. I count these minutiae so that it is better understood that morning of my friend; And the evening shall come, and the morning and the evening shall be made the first day, as in the Genesis, where there were seven.</p><h2>XIX - Without Fail</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>When I got home it was night. I came quickly, but not so much that I did not think of the terms in which I would speak to the addressee. I formulated the request of my head, choosing the words I would say and the tone of them, between dry and benevolent. In the chacara, before I entered the house, I repeated them with a loud voice, to see if they were adequate and obeyed the recommendations of Capitú: "I must speak to him without fail tomorrow; choose the logar and tell me. "I uttered them slowly, and still more slowly the words without fail, as if to underline them. I repeated them again, and then I found them very dry, almost harsh, and, frankly, unfit for a mature man. I took care of picking others, and stopped. </p><p>After all, I told myself that the words could serve, everything was said in a tone that did not offend. And the proof is that, repeating them again, quasi supplices came out to me. It was enough not to carry so much, or sweeten much, a middle ground. "And Capitú is right, I thought, the house is mine, he is a simple aggregate ... Geito is, he could work very well for me, and undo Mama's plan." </p><h2>XX - A Thousand Priest-ours and a Thousand Ave Marias</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I raised my eyes to the sky, which was beginning to become bewildered, but it was not to cover or cover it. It was to the other heaven that I lifted up my soul; it was to my refuge, my friend. And then he said of me to me: </p><p>"I pray to pray a thousand priests of ours and a thousand Ave Maria, if Jose Dias arranges for me not to go to the seminary. </p><p>The sum was huge. The reason is that I was laden with unfulfilled promises. The last one was two hundred of our fathers and two hundred Marys, if it did not rain one afternoon to Santa Theresa. It did not rain, but I did not pray the prayers. From a little boy I had become accustomed to asking heaven for its favors, through prayers I would say, if they would come. The first said, the others were delayed, and as they crowded they were forgotten. So I got to the numbers twenty, thirty, fifty. I went into the hundreds and now into the thousand. It was a way of praying the divine will for the amount of prayer; in addition, every new promise was made and sworn to pay the old debt. But they go there to kill the laziness of a soul that brought it from the cradle and did not feel it attenuated by life! The sky did me the favor, I delayed the payment. I finally got lost in the accounts. </p><p>"A thousand," I repeated to myself. </p><p>Indeed, the matter of benefit was now immense, no less than the salvation or the wreck of my entire existence. Thousand thousand It took a sum that paid for all the arrears. God could very well, irritated by forgetfulness, refuse to listen to me without much money.... A grave man, it is possible that these boyish aggravations strike you, if you do not think them ridiculous. Sublime were not. I have done much in the way of redeeming spiritual debt. I did not think of another species in which, through intention, everything was fulfilled, closing the record of my moral conscience without deficit. To say a hundred Masses, or to go up from the knees to Gloria's slope to hear one, to go to the Holy Land, all that the old slaves told me of celebrated promises, all came to me without ever fixing my mind. It was very hard to climb a bend on my knees; he must have wounded them by force. The Holy Land was far away. Masses were numerous, they could engage my soul again .... </p><h2>XXI - Before Justina</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>On the veranda I found cousin Justina pacing back and forth. He came to the landing and asked me where I had been.</p><p>"I was here on foot, talking to D. Fortunata, and distracted me. It's late, is not it? Mom asked about me?</p><p>He asked, but I said that you had already come.</p><p>The lie startled me, no less than the frankness of the news. It is not that Cousin Justina was of bio-glasses; said frankly to Peter the evil that he thought of Paul, and to Paul what he thought of Peter; but to confess what a lie is that it seemed new to me. She was a four-year-old woman, thin and pale, with a thin mouth and curious eyes. He lived with us please of my mother, and also of interest; my mother wanted to have an intimate lady at her feet, and rather a strange relative.</p><p>We spent a few minutes on the balcony, lit by a lantern. To know if I had not forgotten my mother's ecclesiastical plans, and telling her no, inquired about my taste for fatherhood. I replied elusive:</p><p>"Father's life is very beautiful."</p><p>"Yes, she is beautiful; but what I ask is if you would like to be a priest, "he explained, laughing.</p><p>"I like what Mother wants."</p><p>"First Gloria wishes you very well, but even if you did not wish to, there is someone in the house who puts that in your head."</p><p>-Who is it?</p><p>-Well, who! Who is hade to be? Primo Cosme is not, who does not care about it; me neither.</p><p>-José Dias? concludes.</p><p>-Naturally.</p><p>I wrinkled my forehead questioningly, as if I did not know anything. Prima Justina completed the news saying that even that afternoon Jose Dias had reminded my mother of the old promise.</p><p>"Gloria, it may be that, in passing the days, she will forget the promise; but how can you forget that a person is always in your ears, you will give, talking about the seminary? And the speeches he makes, the praises of the church, and that the priest's life is this and that, all with those words that only he knows, and that affection ... Note that it is only to do evil, because he is so religious, like this lantern. For it is true, even today. Do not take it for granted ... This afternoon you spoke like you do not know.</p><p>"But did you say anything?" I asked, to see if she was telling the story of my relationship with my neighbor.</p><p>Did not tell; made only a gesture as if to indicate that there was something else he could not say. Again he advised me not to think of myself as such, and recapitulated all the evil I thought of Jose Dias, and he was no small thing, an intriguer, a sycophant, a speculator, and, despite the bark of politeness, a rudeness. I, after a few moments, said:</p><p>"Justina, could you do something?"</p><p>Of what?</p><p>"Supposing I did not like being a priest ... you could ask Mom ..."</p><p>"Not that," he said promptly; Gloria has this business firmly in her head, and there is nothing in the world that makes her change her mind; just the time. You were still little, she told all the people of our friendship, or just known. There revive his memory, no, that I do not work for the misfortune of others; but also, ask for something else, I do not ask. If she consulted me, well; if she would say to me, 'Prima Justina, what do you think?' My reply was: 'Gloria, I think that if he likes to be a priest, he can go; but if you do not like it, it's best to stay. "And what would I say and say if she ever consulted with me. Now, go talk to him without being called, I will not.</p><h2>XXII - Feelings from Others</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I did not get anything else, and to the end I regretted the request: I should have followed Capitú's advice. Then, as I wanted to go inside, Cousin Justina kept me a few minutes, talking about the heat and the next feast of the Conception, my old oratorios, and finally of Capitú. He said no evil; on the contrary, he insinuated that I might become a pretty girl. I, who thought she was so beautiful, would cry out that she was the most beautiful creature in the world, if I were not afraid to be discreet. However, as cousin Justina would commend herself to him for the manners, gravity, customs, working for his own, the love of my mother, all this accentuated me to the point of praising her too. When it was not with words, it was with the gesture of approbation I gave to each one of the other's assertions, and certainly with the happiness that should illumine my face. I did not notice that this confirmed the denunciation of Jose Dias, heard by her, in the afternoon, in the parlor, if she did not already suspect it. I just thought about that in bed. Only then did I feel that the eyes of cousin Justina, when I spoke, seemed to touch me, to hear me, to smell me, to like me, to make the officio of all the senses. Ciumes could not be; between a brat of my age and a forty-year-old widow there was no place for jealousy. It is certain that, after a while, he modified the accolades to Capitú, and even made some criticisms to him, he told me that it was a little trefega and looked under; but still, I do not think they were jealous. I believe before ... yes ... yes, I believe this. I believe that Cousin Justina found in the spectacle of the sensations of others a vague resurrection of her own. It is also enjoyed by influence of the lips that narrate.</p><h2>XXIII - Deadline Given</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I must speak to you tomorrow, without fail; choose the login and tell me. </p><p>I think José Dias thought this was my talk. The tone would not be as imperative as I feared, but the words were, and not questioning, not asking, not hesitating, as it was proper to my usual style and growth, it certainly gave you the idea of ​​a new person and a new situation. It was in the hall when we went to tea; Jose Dias had been walking full of Walter Scott's reading of my mother and cousin Justina. Lia sung and paced. The castellos and parks grew larger than the lagoon, the lakes had more water, and the "celestial dome" counted a few thousand more sparkling stars. In the dialogues he alternated the sound of the voices, which were slightly thick or thin, according to the sex of the interlocutors, and reproduced in moderation the tenderness and the cholera. </p><p>When he said goodbye to me on the porch, he said to me: </p><p>"Tomorrow, on the street. I have some shopping to do, you can go with me, I'll ask Mom. Is it licensing day? </p><p>-The license was today. </p><p>-Perfectly. I do not ask you what it is; I affirm right now that it is serious and pure matter. </p><p>-Yes sir. </p><p>-See you tomorrow. </p><p>You have done all the best you can. There was only one change: my mother found the day warm and would not let me walk; We got in the bus, at the door of the house. "It does not matter," said Jose Dias; we can leave the door of the Promenade. </p><h2>XXIV - Mother and Servant</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>José Dias treated me with motherly extremes and servant attentions. The first thing he did as soon as I began to walk outside was to dispense with my page; A sign was made, I went with the street. I took care of my arrangements at home, my books, my shoes, my hygiene and my prosody. At the age of eight my plains lacked, at any rate, the correct ending, he corrected it, half-serious to give authority to the license, half laughing to obtain the pardon of the amendment. This helped the master of first letters. Later on, when Father Cabral taught me Latin, doctrine, and sacred history, he would attend to his ecclesiastical reflections, and in the end he would ask the priest: "Is not it true that our young friend is moving fast?" 'A prodigy'; my mother said that I had once known very intelligent boys, but that I exceeded all of them, not to mention that for my age I already possessed a number of solid moral qualities. I, since I did not value the value of this other compliment, I liked the compliment; was a compliment. </p><h2>XXV - The Promenade</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>We entered the Promenade. Some old faces, other sick or just plain sluts scattered gloomily on the path from the door to the terrace. We proceed to the terrace. Walking, to give me encouragement, I spoke of the garden:</p><p>"It's been a long time since I've been here, maybe a year.</p><p>"Forgive me," he said, "it has not been three months since you were here with our neighbor Padua; do not you remember?</p><p>"It's true, but it was so far ..."</p><p>"Elle asked her mother to let him bring her, and she, who is good as the mother of God, consented; but listen to me, since we're talking about this, it's not nice that you walk with Padova on the street.</p><p>-But I walked a few times ...</p><p>"When I was younger; in a natural way, he could be created. But you are getting young, and he is gaining confidence. D. Gloria, after all, can not like this. The Padova people are not bad at all. Capitú, despite those eyes that the devil gave you ... Have you noticed her eyes? They are so obliquely and disguised gypsy. For, in spite of them, he could pass, if not for vanity and adulation. Oh! the adulation! Fortunata deserves esteem, and he does not deny that he is honest, has a good job, owns the house in which he ran, but honesty and esteem are not enough, and the other qualities lose much of value with the bad company in which he walks. Padova has a tendency for good people. In him smelling like a man is with him. I do not say this out of hatred, or that he speaks ill of me and laughed, as he laughed, for days, at my shoes.</p><p>"Excuse me," I interrupted, stopping short, "I never heard you speak ill of you; on the contrary, one day, not long ago, he told a man in my presence that you were "a man of ability and could speak like a deputy in the chambers."</p><p>Jose Dias smiled deliciously, but made a great effort and closed his face again; then he replied:</p><p>"I do not thank you." Others, of better blood, have done me the favor of high judgments. And none of that prevents him from being what I tell him.</p><p>We walked again, climbed the terrace, and looked out to sea.</p><p>"I see you do not want my benefit," I said after a moment.</p><p>"Why else, Bentinho?"</p><p>"In this case, I ask you a favor."</p><p>-A favor? Send, order, what is it?</p><p>-Mom...</p><p>For a while I could not tell the rest, that it was not enough, and it came from heaven. Jose Dias asked again what it was, shook me gently, lifted my chin and stared at me, anxious as well, like cousin Justina in the evening.</p><p>"Mom what?" What does Mom have?</p><p>"Mother wants me to be a priest, but I can not be a priest," he finally said.</p><p>Jose Dias straightened in amazement.</p><p>"I can not," I continued, no less astonished than he, "I have no space, not a taste of the life of a priest." I'm for whatever she wants; Mom knows I do everything she says; I am ready to be whatever you like, even a bus driver. Father, no; I can not be a priest. The career is beautiful, but it's not for me.</p><p>All this discourse did not come out of me like that, naturally, peremptory, as it might seem from the text, but in pieces, chewed, in a slightly deaf and timid voice. Nevertheless, Jose Dias had heard him startled. She certainly did not count on resistance, no matter how small; but what astonished him most was this conclusion:</p><p>"I'm counting on you to save me."</p><p>The man's eyes widened, his eyebrows arched, and the pleasure I was counting on giving him the choice of protection did not show in any of the muscles. His whole face was too little for stupefaction. Indeed, the matter of discourse had revealed in me a new soul; I myself did not know myself. But the final word is that it brought a unique vigor. Jose Dias was stunned. When the eyes became ordinary dimensions:</p><p>"But what can I do?" He asked.</p><p>- Very much. You know that in our house everyone appreciates it. Mom asks for your advice a lot, does not she? Uncle Cosme says that you are a talented person ...</p><p>"They're good," he said flatly. They are favors of worthy people who deserve everything ... There it is! no one will ever hear me say anything about such people; because? because they are illustrious and virtuous. Your mother is a saint, your uncle is a perfect gentleman. I have known different families; none can overcome yours in nobility of feelings. The talent that your uncle finds in me I confess I have, but it is only one, -is the talent to know what is good and worthy of admiration and appreciation.</p><p>"You must also protect your friends, like me."</p><p>"How can I help you, angel of the sky?" I will not dissuade your mother from a project that is, beyond promise, the ambition and dream of long years. When you can, it's late. Still, he did me the favor of saying: "José Dias, I must put Bentinho in the seminary."</p><p>Shyness is not such a bad coin, as it seems. If I were fearless, it is probable that with the indignation I experienced I would break the call of a liar, but then I would have to confess to him that I had been listening, behind the door, and one action was worth another. I was content to reply that it was not too late.</p><p>"It's not late, it's time, if you will."</p><p>"If I want to?" But what other thing do I want, if not servile? What desire, but be happy, as it deserves?</p><p>"It's still time. Look, it's not out of hand. I am ready for everything; if she wants me to study laws, I'm going to S. Paulo...</p><h2>XXVI - The Laws are Beautiful</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>José Dias's face was similar to the reflection of an idea, an idea that rejoiced him extraordinarily. He paused a moment; I had my eyes on him, he had returned to the side of the bar. How he insisted:</p><p>"It's late," he said. but to prove to you that there is no lack of will, I will speak to your mother. Do not promise to win but to fight; I will work with soul. Devéras, do not you want to be a priest? The laws are beautiful, my dear ... You can go to S. Paulo, to Pernambuco, or even further. There are good universities around the world. Go to the laws, if such is your vocation. I'll tell D. Gloria, but do not count on me alone; Tell your uncle too.</p><p>-I have to talk.</p><p>"Go with God, too-with God and the Blessed Virgin," he concluded, pointing to the sky.</p><p>The sky was a bit crushed. In the air, near the beach, great black birds made turns, flying or hovering, and came down to rub their feet in the water, and rose again to descend again. But neither the shadows of the sky nor the fantastic dances of the birds diverted me from the spirit of my interlocutor. After I answered yes, I asked myself:</p><p>"God will do what you want."</p><p>"Do not blaspheme. God owns everything; He alone is the earth and the sky, the past, the present, and the future. Ask him for your happiness, that I do not do anything else ... Since you can not be a priest, and prefer the laws ... The laws are beautiful, without undoing in theology, which is better than everything, as the ecclesiastical life is the holiest ... Why should not you study law from here? Better to go to some university soon, and at the same time study, travel. We can go together; we will see the foreign lands, we will hear English, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian and even Swedish. D. Gloria probably will not be able to accompany you; even if you can and will, you will not want to guide business, paperwork, tuition, and take care of hostels, and walk with you from side to side ... Oh! the laws are beautiful!</p><p>"Is it said, you ask my mother not to put me in the seminary?"</p><p>"Ask, I ask, but asking is not reaching. Angel of my heart, if the will to serve is power to command, we are here, we are on board. There! you do not know what Europe is; oh! the Europe...</p><p>He lifted his leg and pirouetted. One of his ambitions was to return to Europe, to speak of her many times, without ever trying my mother or Uncle Cosme, no matter how she praised the air and the beauties ... I did not count on this possibility of going with me, and staying there during the eternity of my studies.</p><p>"We're on board, Bentinho, we're on board!"</p><h2>XXVII - To the Gate</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>At the gate of the Promenade, a beggar held out his hand. José Dias passed on, but I thought about Capitú and the seminary, I took two vintens out of my pocket and gave them to the beggar. He kissed the coin; I asked him to pray to God for me so that I could fulfill all my desires. </p><p>-Yes, my devotee! </p><p>"Let me tell you, Benedict, I came back to enlighten you." </p><h2>XXVIII - In the Street</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jose Dias was so happy that he changed the man from the grave moments, as he was to the street, by the man who was folding and restless. He moved all over, talked about everything, made me stop at every step before a display or a theater poster. He told me the plot of some pieces, recited monologues in verse. He did all the errands, paid bills, received rents from home; for you bought a twenty-lot lottery. After all, the tezo man yielded the flexible, and proceeded to speak slowly, with superlatives. I did not see that change was natural; I was afraid that I had changed the settled resolution, and I entered it with affectionate words and gestures until we entered the omnibus. </p><h2>XXIX - The Emperor</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>On the way we met the emperor, who came from the Medical School. The bus we were on stopped, like all vehicles; the passengers went down to the street and took off their hats, until the imperial coach passed. When I returned to my place, I had a fantastic idea, the idea of ​​going to the emperor, telling him everything and asking him to intervene. I would not trust it. this idea to Capitú. "Your Majesty asking, Mother gives way," I thought to myself.</p><p>Then I saw the emperor listening to me, reflecting and ending by saying yes, that I would speak to my mother; I kissed her hand with tears. And soon I found myself in the house, waiting, until I heard the beaters and the cavalry picket; is the emperor! is the emperor! everyone came to the janellas to watch him pass, but it did not pass, the car stopped at our door, the emperor fell and went inside. Great uproar in the neighborhood: "The emperor entered the house of D. Gloria! What will it be? What will not be? "Our family went out to receive it; my mother was the first to kiss her hand. Then the emperor, all laughing, without entering the room or entering, "I do not remember well, dreams are often confused," you kept my mother from making me priest, and she, flattered and obedient, promised not to.</p><p>"Medicine, why do not you tell him to teach medicine?"</p><p>Since it pleases Your Majesty ...</p><p>"Teach him medicine; It's a beautiful career, and we have good teachers here. Never went to our school? It's a beautiful school. We already have doctors of first order, who can manate with the best of other lands. Medicine is a great science; it is enough to give health to others, to know the discomfort, to fight them, to beat them ... You yourself must have seen miracles. Her husband died, but the disease was fatal, and he was not careful in itself ... It is a beautiful career; Send it to our school. Do it for me, will you? Do you want it, Bentinho?</p><p>-Mom wanting.</p><p>-I want, my son. Your Majesty rules.</p><p>Then the emperor would kiss his hand again, and he would go out, accompanied by all of us, the street full of people, the window tops, a silence of wonder; the emperor would get in the car, leaning forward and making a good-bye gesture, saying, "Medicine, our School." And the car left between envy and thanks.</p><p>All this I have seen and heard. No, Ariosto's imagination is no more fertile than that of the boy and the boyfriends, nor does the vision of the impossible need more than an omnibus. I comforted myself for a moment, let's say minutes, until the plan was destroyed and I turned to the dreamless faces of my companions.</p><h2>XXX - The Holy One</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>You will have understood that this memory of the emperor near medicine was nothing more than the suggestion of my unwillingness to leave Rio de Janeiro. The dreams of the accordion are like other dreams, woven by the design of our inclinations and our memories. Go to S. Paulo, but Europe ... It was very far, very sea and long. Long live the medicine! I would tell Capitú about these hopes.</p><p>"Looks like the Holy One is coming," someone said in the bus. I hear a bell; Yes, I believe it's in Santo Antonio dos Pobres. Stop, Mr. Receiver!</p><p>The receiver of the tickets pulled the strap to the coachman's arm, the bus stopped, and the man went down. Jose Dias gave two quick turns to the head, took me by the arm and made me go down with him. We would also accompany the Blessed One. Effectively, the bell called the faithful to the service of the last hour. There were already some people in the sacristy. It was the first time that I was in such a serious moment; I obeyed, at first embarrassed, but soon thereafter satisfied, less by the charity of the service than by giving me a man's office. When the sacristan began to distribute the opas, a bloated fellow entered; it was my neighbor Padua, who was also going to accompany the Blessed One. He came with us, he came to please us. Jose Dias made a gesture of annoyance, and only answered him with a dry word, looking at the priest, who was washing his hands. Then, as Padua spoke to the sacristan, he approached them quietly; I did the same thing. Padova asked the sacristan for one of the pallio's sticks. José Dias asked for one for himself.</p><p>"There's only one available," said the sacristan.</p><p>"That's it," said Jose Dias.</p><p>"But I had asked for it first," said Padua.</p><p>"He asked first, but he was late," said Jose Dias; I was already here. Take a torch.</p><p>Padua, in spite of his fear of the other, insisted on wanting the stick, all this in a low, deaf voice. The sacristan found a way to reconcile the rivalry, taking himself to obtain from one of the other insurers of the pallio to yield the rod to Padua, known in the parochia, as Jose Dias. He did so; but José Dias overthrew this combination. No, since we had another staff available, I would ask it for me, a young seminarian, to whom this distinction was most correct. Padua was pallid, like the torches. It was to test a father's heart. The sacristan, who knew me from seeing me there with my mother on Sundays, asked curiously if I was a seminarian.</p><p>"Not yet, but I'll seal it," Jose Dias replied, winking at my left eye, which, despite the warning, made me angry.</p><p>"Well, early to our Bentinho," sighed Capitú's mother.</p><p>For my part, I wanted to give him the rod; reminded me that he used to accompany the Holy Sacrament to the dying, carrying a torch, but the last time he had obtained a stick from the pallio. The special distinction of the pallio came from covering the vicar and the sacrament; torch anyone served. It was he himself that told me and explained this, full of a pious and laughing glory. Thus is understood the excitement with which he had entered the church; it was Pallio's second time, so much so that he soon took care of him. It's nothing! And he returned to the torch commum, again the interrupted interim; the administrator was returning to the old post. the man who had been imprisoned forbade this act of generosity, and asked the sexton to bring him and me with the two front sticks, breaking the march of the pallio.</p><p>Opas threaded, torches distributed and accesses, priest and ciborio promptos, the sacristan of hyssope and bell in the hands, left the prestito to the street. When I saw myself with one of the rods, passing by the faithful, who knelt, I was moved. Padua gnawed the torch bitterly. It is a metaphor, I do not find another more lively way of saying the pain and humiliation of my neighbor. Moreover, I could not look at him for a long time, nor at the aggregate, who, parallel to me, raised his head with the air of being himself the God of the army. With little, I felt sore; the arms fell to me, fortunately the house was near, in the street of the Senate.</p><p>The sick woman was a widowed, tisic lady, she had a daughter of fifteen or sixteen years, who was crying at the bedroom door. The girl was not beautiful, she might not even have any fun; her hair was disheveled, and the tears made her eyes twitch. Nevertheless, the total spoke and captured the heart. The vicar confessed to the sick, gave him the communion and the holy oils. The girl's sobbing redoubled so much that I felt my eyes wet and ran away. I came to the port of a jannela. Poor creature! The pain was communicative in itself; complicated with the memory of my mother, it hurt me more, and when at last I thought of Capitú, I felt an urge to sob too, I went down the corridor, and I heard someone say to me:</p><p>"Do not cry like that!"</p><p>The image of Capitú was with me, and my imagination, just as he had given him tears, has only recently filled his mouth with laughter; I saw her writing on the wall, talking to me, walking around with her arms in the air; I distinctly heard my name, a sweetness that made me drunk, and the voice was of her. The torches, so lugubrious at the time, had the air of a nuptial luster. What was a wedding luster? Do not know; was something contrary to death, and I see no other than weddings. This new sensation overwhelmed me so much that Jose Dias came to me and whispered in my ear,</p><p>"Do not laugh like that!"</p><p>I got serious quickly. It was the moment of departure. I took it from my rod; and as we already knew the distance, and now we returned to the church, which was the smallest distance, -the weight of the rod was very small. Besides, the sun outside, the excitement of the street, the young men of my age who looked at me with envy, the devotees who came to the windows or entered the corridors and kneeled our passage, everything filled my soul with new lepidity.</p><p>Padovan, on the contrary, was more humiliated. Despite being replaced by me, I could not finish consoling myself with the torch, the miserable torch. And yet there were others who also carried a torch, and only showed the composure of the act; they were not gaudy, but they were not sad either. One saw that they walked with honor.</p><h2>XXXI - The Curiosities of Capitú</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Capitú preferred everything to the seminary. Instead of being overwhelmed by the threat of the long separation, if she avenged the idea of ​​Europe, she was satisfied. And when I told you my imperial dream:</p><p>"No, Bentinho, let us leave the emperor on his own," he replied; Let us stay for the moment with the promise of José Dias. When did he say he would speak to your mother?</p><p>"It did not mark day; promised that he would see, that he would speak as soon as he could, and that he would catch me with God.</p><p>Capitú wanted to repeat to him all the answers of the addict, the changes of the gesture and even the pirouette, that only had told him. He asked for the sound of words. It was meticulous and thoughtful; the narration and the dialogue, everything seemed to mingle with me. It was also possible to say that I conferred, labeled and preached in memory my exposition. This image is by chance better than the other, but the best of them is none. Capitú was Capitú, that is, a very particular creature, more woman than I was a man. If you still have not said it, there it is. If so, stay too. There are concepts that must be instilled in the soul of the reader, by the force of repetition.</p><p>She was even more curious. The curiosities of Capitú give to a chapter. They were of various kinds, explicable and inexplicable, so useful as useless, some serious, others frivolous; I liked to know everything. In the college where, from the age of seven, he had learned to read, write and count, France, doctrine and needlework, he did not, for example, learn to make income; for that very reason, that Cousin Just had to teach him. If he did not study Latin with Father Cabral, it was because the priest, after having proposed it with jest, ended up saying that Latin was not the language of girls. Capitú confessed to me one day that this reason gave rise to the desire to know it. On the other hand, he wanted to learn English with an old friend of his father's teacher and his partner, but it was not good. Uncle Cosme taught him backgammon. </p><p>"Go get a little cap, Capitú," he told her.</p><p>Capitú obeyed and played easily, with attention, I do not know if I said with love. One day I was achal-drawing her a picture; gave me the last tears, and asked me to wait to see if it was alike. It was my father's, copied from the screen my mother had in the room and is still with me. Perfection was not; on the contrary, the eyes went out in a husk, and the hairs were small circles on one another. But since she did not have any rudiments of art, and having done so in a few minutes, I thought it was a work of great merit; Discard me the truth and the sympathy. Still, I was apprehending painting easily, as I learned music later. I was already dating the piano in our house, an old useless fret, just a pet. He read our novels, he leafed through our picture books, wanting to know about the ruins, the people, the campaigns, the name, the history, the achievement. Jose Dias gave him this news with a certain pride of erudite. His erudition did not outweigh much more than his homotopathy of Cantagallo.</p><p>One day, Capitú wanted to know what the living room figures were. The lodger said it briefly, lingering a little longer in Cesar, with exclamations and latins:</p><p>-Caesar! Julio Cesar! Big man! You quoque, Brute?</p><p>Capitú did not think Cesar's profile was pretty, but the actions quoted by Jose Dias gave him admiring gestures. He looked at him for a long time. A man who could do anything! who did everything! A man who gave a lady a pearl worth six million sesterces!</p><p>"And how much was every sesterce worth?"</p><p>José Dias, not having in mind the value of the sestercio, responded with enthusiasm:</p><p>"He's the greatest man in history!"</p><p>Caesar's pearls brightened the eyes of Captain. It was on this occasion that she asked my mother why she no longer wore the picture jewels; I preferred the one in the room with my father's; had a large necklace, a diadem and earrings.</p><p>"They are widowed jewels, as I am, Capitú."</p><p>-When did you put these on?</p><p>"It was for the Coronation parties.</p><p>-Oh! tell me the Coronation parties!</p><p>He already knew what the paes had told him, but of course he had for himself that they would know little more than what happened in the streets. He wanted the news of the tribunes of the Imperial Capella and the ballrooms. He had been born long after those celebrations. Listening to speak several times of the Majority, it took one day to know what this event was; they said to him, and thought that the emperor had done well enough to go up to the throno at the age of fifteen. Everything was a matter of the curiosities of Capitú, old furniture, old implements, customs, news of Itaguahy, the childhood and the youth of my mother, a saying from here, a dalli memory, an adagio from there ...</p><h2>XXXII - Hangover Eyes</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was all part of Capitú's curiosities. If there was, however, in which I do not know if he apprehended or taught, or if he did both things, as I did. That's what I'll tell you in the next chapter. This is not to say that after a few days of adjustment with the guest, I went to see my friend; it was ten o'clock in the morning. D. Fortunata, who was in the yard, did not even expect me to ask about his daughter.</p><p>"He's in the room combing his hair," he told me; go slowly to scare him.</p><p>I went slowly, but either the foot or the mirror betrayed me. This could be that it was not; it was a little pataca mirror (pardon the cheapness), bought from an Italian pedlar, a rough frame, a brass ring, hanging from the wall between the two windows. If it was not him, it was the foot. One or the other, the truth is that I just entered the room, comb, hair, and all flew through the air, and I only heard him this question:</p><p>"Anything?"</p><p>"Nothing," I replied; I came to see you before Father Cabral arrives for the license. How was your night?</p><p>-I well. José Dias has not spoken yet?</p><p>"It does not seem so."</p><p>"But then when do you speak?"</p><p>"He told me that today or tomorrow he intends to touch the subject; do not go banging, it will speak loudly and by far, a touch. Then it will come into matter. First you want to see if Mom has the resolution made ...</p><p>"What's the matter," interrupted Capt. And if it did not take somebody to win already, and at all, you would not be told. I do not even know if Jose Dias can influence so much; I think it will do everything, if you feel that you really do not want to be a priest, but can you reach ...? He is attended to; but if ... It's a hell of a thing! You get on with it, Bentinho.</p><p>-Time; today he must speak.</p><p>-You swear?</p><p>-Swear! Let your eyes see, Capitú.</p><p>He had reminded me of the definition that Joseph had given them, "eyes of gypsy obliqued and disguised." I did not know what was obliquely but concealed knew, and wanted to see if you could call it that. Capitú stood and looked. I only wondered what it was if I had never seen them; I found nothing extraordinary; the color and the sweetness were mine. The delay of contemplation I believe gave another idea of ​​my intent; he imagined that it was a pretext to look at them more closely, with my long, constant eyes, stuck in them, and this meant that they would become grown, grown and somber, with such an expression that ...</p><p>Rhetorica dos namorados, give me an exact and poetic comparison to say what those eyes of Capitú were. There is no image capable of saying, without breaking the dignity of the stall, what they were and did to me. Hangover eyes? Come on, you hangover. That's what gives me the idea of ​​that new feature. They did not know what a mysterious and energetic fluid, a force that dragged in, like the wave that leaves the beach on the days of hangover. In order not to be dragged, I clung to the other small parts, to the ears, to the arms, to the hair scattered about the shoulders; but as soon as I searched for the pupils, the wave that came out of them was growing, dark and dark, threatening to envelop me, to pull me and to swallow me. How many minutes did we spend on that game? Only the watches of the sky will have marked this infinite and brief time. Eternity has its pendulums nor for not ending never ceases to want to know the duration of happiness and suppliments. The joy of the blessed of heaven must be doubled to know the depths of the torments which their enemies have already suffered in hell; so too will the quantity of delights enjoyed by the disaffected in heaven increase the pains of the condemned of hell. This other suppliment escaped the divine Dante; but I'm not here to mend poets. I'm about to tell you that, after an unmarked time, I finally grabbed hold of Capitú's hair, but then with my hands, and told him-to say something-that I could do them if I wanted to.</p><p>-You?</p><p>-Myself.</p><p>"It will embarrass my whole hair, that, yes."</p><p>"Get embarrassed, you get it off later."</p><p>-We will see.</p><h2>XXXIII - The Hairstyle</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Captain turned his back to me, turning to the mirror. I took it from my hair, I gathered it all and I put it in with the comb, from the forehead to the tips that came down to the waist. Standing there was no place: you did not forget that she was a little taller than me, but even if she was of the same height. I asked him to sit down.</p><p>Sit here, it's better.</p><p>Sat down. "Let's see the big hairdresser," he said, laughing. I continued to smooth my hair very carefully, and divided them into two equal parts, to make up the two locks. I did not do it at once, not so quickly, as the hairdressers of the officio can suppose, but slowly, slowly, savoring by touch those thick threads, which were part of it. The work was caught, sometimes by chance, sometimes by purpose, to undo the feat and redo it. Her fingers brushed the back of her neck or cheetah-clad sparrows, and the sensation was a delight. But, finally, the hair was coming to an end, no matter how much I wanted it to be interminable. I did not ask the sky that they should be as long as those of the Aurora, because I did not yet know this divinity which the old poets presented to me later; but I wished to comb them all the centuries of the ages, to weave two braids that could encircle the infinite for an unnumbered number of times. If this seems emphatic to you, you unfortunate reader, you have never combed a small one, you have never stood before the teenage hands in the young head of a nympha ... A nympha! I'm all mythological. There is little left, speaking of his hangover eyes, I have written Thetis; I scolded Thetis, let's show nympha; let's just say a beloved creature, a word that involves all Christian and pagan powers. Anyway, I finished the two braids. Where was the ribbon to tie the ends? On the table, a sad piece of broken tape. I gathered up the ends of the braids, joined them by a bow, I touched the work, stretching it here, flattening it there, until I exclaimed:</p><p>-Prompt!</p><p>"Will it be all right?"</p><p>-See in the mirror.</p><p>Instead of going to the mirror, what do you think Capitú did? Do not forget that she was sitting with her back to me. Capitú melted his head to such an extent that I had to go with my hands and amparaly; the back of the chair was low. I leaned over her, face to face, but changed, the eyes of one in the line of the mouth of the other. I asked her to raise her head, she could get dizzy, her neck hurt. I even told her I was ugly; but even this reason did not.</p><p>"Get up, Capitú!"</p><p>He did not want to, he did not raise his head, and we looked at each other until she bent her lips, I lowered mine, and ...</p><p>Great was the feeling of the kiss; Capitú got up, quickly, I backed up to the wall with a sort of vertigo, speechless, dark eyes. When they cleared me, I saw that Capitú had his on the floor. I did not dare say anything; even if I wanted to, I lacked a language. Stunned and stunned, I could not find a gesture or an impulse to take myself off the wall and throw myself at her with a thousand words, silent and mimetic ... Not mocking my fifteen years, an early reader. At seventeen, Des Grieux (and still more was Des Grieux) had not yet thought of the difference of the sexes.</p><h2>XXXIV -I'm a Man!</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>We heard footsteps in the hallway; it was D. Fortunata. Capitú made up quickly, so quickly that when her mother pointed at the door, she shook her head and laughed. No laivo amarello. no contraction of shyness, a spontaneous and clear laugh, which she explained by these cheerful words:</p><p>"Mother, look how this gentleman hairdressed me; asked me to finish the hairstyle, and did this. See what braids!</p><p>-That has? his mother came, overflowing with benevolence. It's fine, no one will say it's from a person who does not know how to comb.</p><p>"What, Mama?" This? said Capitú, undoing the braids. Why, Mother!</p><p>And with a graceful and voluntary annoyance he sometimes had, he took the comb and smoothed his hair to renew the hairstyle. Fortunata called her a fool, and she told me not to listen, it was nothing, she was crazy about her daughter. She looked at me tenderly for her. Then I think he suspected. Seeing me silent, stuck, stitched to the wall, he thought perhaps that there had been something more than a hairstyle among us, and he smiled through dissimulation ...</p><p>Since I wanted to speak also to disguise my condition, I called a few words from the inside, and they came forward with promptitude, but with an attack, and filled my mouth without being able to leave any. Capitú's kiss closed my lips. An exclamation, a simple article, no matter how hard they invested, could not break from within. And all the words gathered to his heart, murmuring: "Here is one who will not make a great career in the world unless his emotions overpower him ..."</p><p>So, caught by his mother, we were two and opposites, she covering up with the word what I published by silence. D. Fortunata took me out of that hesitation, saying that my mother had told me to call for the Latin license; Father Cabral was waiting for me. It was an exit; I said goodbye and went down the hall. Walking, I heard her mother blame her daughter's ways, but her daughter said nothing.</p><p>I ran to my room, picked up the books, but did not go through the licensing room; I sat on the bed, remembering the hairstyle and the rest. I had shudders, I had some forgetfulness in which I lost consciousness of myself and the things that surrounded me, to live, I do not know where or how. And he would turn to me, and see the bed, the walls, the books, the floor, hear some sound of fóra, vague, near or remote, and soon lose everything to feel only the lips of Capitú ... He felt them stretched, beneath mine, equally stretched out to the della, and uniting with one another. Suddenly, unintentionally, without thinking, this word of pride left me:</p><p>-I'm a man!</p><p>Supposing they had listened to me, for the word went out in a loud voice, and I ran to the bedroom door. There was no one else. I went back inside, and quietly repeated that I was a man. I still have the fool in my ears. The taste this gave me was enormous. Columbus did not have it bigger, discovering America, and forgive banality in favor of the fitting; with each effect, there is in each adolescent a hidden world, an admiral and an October sun. I made other findings later; none of them blew me so much. The denunciation of Jose Dias had disturbed me, the license of the old coconut tree too, the sight of our names opened by it on the wall of the yard gave me great shock, as you have seen; none of this was worth the kiss. It could be a lie or an illusion. True, they were the bones of truth, not flesh and blood. His hands touched, tight, as if cast, could not say everything.</p><p>-I'm a man!</p><p>When I repeated this, for the third time, I thought of the seminary, but how do you think of danger that passed, an aborted evil, an extinct nightmare; all my nerves told me that men are not fathers. Blood was the same. Again I felt the lips of Capitú. Maybe I misuse some of the skeletal reminiscences; but the longing is this; is to pass and pass on the old memories. Now, of all of that time, I believe that the sweetest is this, the newest, the most comprehensive, to which I have fully revealed myself. Others I have, vast and numerous, sweet too, of various species, many intellectuals, even intense. Great man, the memory was less than this.</p><h2>XXXV - Apostolic Protonotary</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I picked up the books and ran the license. I did not run precisely; halfway there I stopped, warning that it must be very late, and they could read something in my countenance. I had the idea of ​​lying, a vertigo that would have laid me down; but the fright that would cause my mother made me reject her. I thought of promising a few dozen priests; but he had another promise open and another favor pending ... No, let's see; I walked, heard cheerful voices, talked carefully. When I entered the room, no one scolded me.</p><p>Father Cabral had received a message from the internship on the eve; went to meet him, and learned that by papal decree he had just been appointed apostolic protonotary. This distinction of the pope had given him great contentment and to all of us. Uncle Cosme and cousin Justina repeated the title with admiration; it was the first time he had sounded in our ears, accustomed to rabbits, monsignors, bishops, nuncios, and internuncios; but that he was apostolic protonotary? Father Cabral explained that it was not exactly the office of the curia, but the honors of him. Uncle Cosme saw himself exalting himself in the voltarete partner, and repeated:</p><p>-Protonotario apostolico!</p><p>And turning to me:</p><p>"Prepare yourself, Bentinho; you can become an apostolic protonotary.</p><p>Cabral listened with pleasure to the repetition of the title. He was standing, taking a few steps, smiling or drumming on the cover of his pussy. The size of the title as it bent his magnificence, since, to bind him to the name, it was too long; this second reflection was Uncle Cosme who made it. Father Cabral came to the conclusion that it was not necessary to tell him everything, it was enough that he was called the protonotary Cabral. It was understood as apostolic.</p><p>-Protonotario Cabral.</p><p>-Yes, you're right; Cabral protonotary.</p><p>"But, Mr. Protonotario," Cousin Justina said to get accustomed to the use of the title, "Is this obliging you to go to Rome?"</p><p>"No, Don Justina.</p><p>"No, it's just the honors," my mother remarked.</p><p>"It does not," said Cabral, who continued to reflect, "it does not prevent that in the cases of greater formality, public acts, letters of ceremony, etc., if we use the whole title: apostolic protonotary. In common use, protonotario enough.</p><p>"All right," they all nodded.</p><p>Jose Dias, who entered shortly after me, applauded the distinction, and recalled, by the way, the first political acts of Pius IX, great hopes of Italy; but no one took the matter; the principal of the hour and of the logar was my old master of Latin. I, returning to myself from the fear, understood that I ought to be of the same length, and this applause was no less to the heart than the others. He patted me on the cheek, and ended up giving me a vacation. It was too much happiness for an hour. A kiss and vacation! I think my face said this, because Uncle Cosme, shaking his belly, called me a cantaloupe; but Jose Dias corrected the joy:</p><p>"You do not have to celebrate the banter; Latin must always be accurate to him, even if he does not become a priest.</p><p>I met my man here. It was the first word, the seed thrown to the ground, just in passing, as if to accustom the ears of the family. My mother smiled at me, full of love and sadness, but she said,</p><p>"You must be a priest, and a handsome priest."</p><p>"Do not forget, sister Gloria, and protonotary too. Protonotario apostolico.</p><p>"The protonotario Santiago, accentuated Cabral.</p><p>If the intention of my Latin master was to get accustomed to the use of the title with the name, I do not know; what I do know is that when I heard my name linked to that title, I wanted to say a bad word. But the will here was rather an idea, an idea without a language, that was left quiet and silent, just like other ideas a little ... But they ask for a special chapter. Let us reiterate this by saying that the Latin master spoke some time of my ecclesiastical ordination, although without great interest. Elle was looking for something else to forget his own glory, but it was the one that dazzled him at the time. He was a slim, serene old man endowed with good qualities. Some flaws had; the most exalted of them was to be greedy, not properly gluttonous; he ate little, but he esteemed the fine and the rare, and our little flat, if it were simple, was less poor than the delle. So when my mother told her to come to dinner, in order to make her health, her eyes would be protonotary, but they were not apostolic. And to please my mother, she took me again, describing my ecclesiastical future, and she wanted to know if she was going to the seminary now, in the next year, and she offered to speak to the "bishop," all of it marquetry of the "protonotario Santiago.</p><h2>XXXVI - Ideas Without Legs, Ideas Without Arms</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I left them on the pretext of playing, and went back to thinking about the adventure of the morning. It was the best he could do, without Latin, and even with Latin. After five minutes, he reminded me to run to the next house, to take Capitú, to undo his braids, to remake them, and to conclude them in that particular way, on a bocca. This is it, come on, this is it ... Only idea! idea without legs! The other legs did not want to run or walk. Much later they left slowly and took me to Capitú's house. When I got there, I found her in the living room, in the same room, sitting on the couch, cushioned in her lap, sewing in peace. He did not look at me with a face, but with theft and fear, or, if you prefer the phraseology of the aggregate, obliquely and disguised. The hands stopped, after the needle was stuck in the panno. I, on the opposite side of the table, did not know what to do; and again the words that I had carried away. So we spent a few long minutes, until she completely left the seam, rose and waited for me. I went to her, and asked if her mother had said anything; he replied that he did not. The mouth with which he replied was such that I think I had caused a gesture of approximation. Certainly Capitú stepped back a little..</p><p>It was an opportunity to pegal it, pull it and kiss it ... Idea only idea without arms! Mine fell and died. I did not know anything about Escriptura. If I knew, it is probable that the spirit of Satanaz made me give the language mystica of Cantico a direct and natural sense. Then he would obey the first verse; "Apply the lips to him, giving me the bone of his mouth." And as for the arms, which had inert, it would suffice to keep the verse. 6th of cap. II: "His left hand is already under my head, and his right hand will embrace me later." You see there the chronology of gestures. It was just an execution; but even though I knew the text, Capitú's attitudes were now so withdrawn that I do not know if I would not stay still, but it was she who took me out of that situation.</p><h2>XXXVII - The Soul is Full of Mysteries</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Father Cabral was waiting a long time ago?</p><p>"I did not give a license today; I had a vacation.</p><p>I explained the reason for the vacation. I also told him that Father Cabral had spoken of my entrance into the seminary, supporting my mother's resolution, and said of her ugly and hard things. Capitú reflected for some time, and ended up asking me if I could go and refresh the priest in the afternoon at my house.</p><p>"But for what?"</p><p>Papa must naturally want to go too, but it is better that he go to the priest's house; it's prettier. Not me, I'm already half-girl, she finished laughing.</p><p>Laughter cheered me up. The words seemed to be a joke to herself, since, since morning, she was a woman, as I was a man. I found it amusing, and to say it all, I wanted to prove to her that I was a whole girl. I took him lightly on his right hand, then on his left, and I was amazed and shaken. It was the idea with hands. To pull Capitú's strings, to oblige her to come after them, but even now the action did not respond to the intention. However, I found myself strong and bold. He did not imitate anyone; I did not live with boys, to teach me anecdotes of love. I did not know Lucrecia's violation. Of the Romans only knew that they spoke for the art of the priest Pereira and were patricians of Pontius Pilate. I do not deny that the end of the morning hairstyle was a great step on the path of loving movement, but the gesture of that time was just the opposite of this. In the morning, she melted her head, now I was running away; nor is it the only way in which the bids differ; At another point, there seemed to be repetition, there was contrast.</p><p>I think I threatened to pull her to me. I do not swear, I was beginning to be so upset that I could not be fully aware of my actions; but I think so, because she retreated and tried to take her hands off mine; then, perhaps because he could not retreat any more, he placed one of his feet back and the other behind, and ran away with his bust. It was this gesture that forced me to hold her hands tightly. The bust finally fell and gave way, but the head did not want to give in too, and, falling back and forth, rendered useless all my efforts, because I was already making efforts, my friend. Not knowing the license of Cantico, I did not go to extend my left hand under her head; This gesture supposes an agreement of wills, and Capitú, who was resisting me now, would take advantage of the gesture to pluck his other hand and escape me entirely. We remained in that fight, without a sound, because despite the attack and the defense, we did not lose the necessary caution so we would not be heard from within; the soul is full of mysteries. Now I know he was pulling her; the head continued to retreat, until it knocked; but then it was Bocca's turn. The mouth of Capitú began a reverse movement, relative to mine, going to one side, when I sought it from the opposite side. In that disagreement we were, without daring a little more, and a little more ...</p><p>On this we hear knock on the door and talk in the hallway. It was Capitú's father, who returned from the office a little earlier, as he sometimes did. «Open, Nanata! Capitú, open! "Apparently it was the same thing in the morning when his mother came upon us, but only apparently; in truth, it was another. Consider that in the morning everything was finished, and D. Fortunata's step was a warning for us to compute ourselves. Now we fought with our fisted hands, and nothing was even begun.</p><p>We heard the bolt of the door leading to the inner corridor; it was the mother who opened it. I, once I confess everything, I say here that I did not have time to let go of the hands of my friend; I thought to myself, but I did, but Captain, before his father had just come in, made an unexpected gesture, put his mouth to my mouth, and gave me what he was unwilling to force. I repeat, the soul is full of mysteries.</p><h2>XXXVIII - What a Scare, My God!</h2><p> </p><p> When Padova, coming from the interior, entered the drawing room, Capitú, standing with his back to me, bending over the seam, as he collected it, he asked aloud: "But, Bentinho, what an apostolic protonotary?" -Well, live! exclaimed the father. "What a scare, my God!" Now the bid is the same; but if I tell you here, so the two sets of forty years ago, is to show that Capitú was not dominated only in the presence of his mother; the father did not fear him anymore. In the midst of a situation that bound me to the language, I used the word with the greatest naivety of this world. My persuasion was that his heart did not beat him any more. He scrambled to his feet, and his face was half-drawn; but I, who knew everything, saw that it was a lie and I was envious. He went to speak to the father, who shook my hand, and wondered why his daughter spoke in apostolic protonotary. Capit6 repelled him what he had heard from me, and soon thought that the father should go and refresh the priest in his house; She would go to mine. And, sticking up the sewing gear, he stumbled down the corridor, shouting childishly: "Mom, dinner, Papa's here!" </p><h2>XXXIX - The Vocation</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Father Cabral was in that first hour of honors where the minimum congratulations are worth for odes. Time comes when the dignified receive the praises as a usual tribute, dead face, without thanks. The bustle of the first hour is better; this state of the soul that sees in the inclination of the bush, touched of the wind, a parabem of the universal flora, brings sensations more intimate and thin than any other. Cabral heard Captain's words with infinite pleasure.</p><p>"Thanks, Capitú, thank you very much; I think you like it too. Is Papa good? And Mom? You do not ask yourself; This guy is really the guy who sells health. And how are we going to pray?</p><p>To all questions, Capitú was responding promptly and well. She wore a better dress and her shoes came out. She was not familiar with the custom, paused at the door of the room for a moment before kissing my mother's hand and her father's hand. As he was given twice a day in five minutes, the protonotary title, Jose Dias, to spare himself from the crowd, gave a short speech in honor "to the paternal and august heart of Pius IX."</p><p>"You're a great prose," said Uncle Cosimo, when he finished.</p><p>Jose Dias smiled without embarrassment. Father Cabral confirmed the praises of the addressee, without his superlatives; to which he added that Cardinal Mastai had evidently been carved for tiára since the beginning of time. And, winking at me, he concluded:</p><p>"Vocation is everything. The ecclesiastical state is perfectly perfect, so long as the priest is already destined for the cradle. There is no vocation, I speak of a sincere and real vocation, a young man could very well study the human letters, which are also useful and honored.</p><p>Padre Cabral retorquia:</p><p>—A vocação é muito, mas o poder de Deus é soberano. Um homem póde não ter gosto á egreja e até perseguil-a, e um dia a voz de Deus lhe fala, e elle sae apostolo; veja S. Paulo.</p><p>—Não contesto, mas o que eu digo é outra cousa. O que eu digo é que se póde muito bem servir a Deus sem ser padre, cá fóra; póde-se ou não se póde?</p><p>—Póde-se.</p><p>—Pois então! exclamou José Dias triumphalmente, olhando em volta de si. Sem vocação é que não ha bom padre, e em qualquer profissão liberal se serve a Deus, como todos devemos.</p><p>—Perfeitamente, mas vocação não é só do berço que se traz.</p><p>—Homem, é a melhor.</p><p>—Um moço sem gosto nenhum á vida ecclesiastica póde acabar por ser muito bom padre; tudo é que Deus o determine. Não me quero dar por modelo, mas aqui estou eu que nasci com a vocação da medicina; meu padrinho, que era coadjutor de Santa Rita, teimou com meu pae para que me mettesse no seminario; meu pae cedeu. Pois, senhor, tomei tal gosto aos estudos e á companhia dos padres, que acabei ordenando-me. Mas, supponha que não acontecia assim, e que eu não mudava de vocação, o que é que acontecia? Tinha estudado no seminario algumas materias que é bom saber, e são sempre melhor ensinadas naquellas casas.</p><p>Prima Justina said:</p><p>-As? So you could go to the seminary and not get a priest?</p><p>Father Cabral answered that yes, he could, and, turning to me, spoke of my vocation, which was manifest; my toys were always church, and I loved the divine offices. The proof did not prove; all the creations of my time were devout. Cabral added that the rector of St. Joseph, to whom he had lately told my mother's promise, had my birth by miracle; he was of the same opinion. Capitú, sewn to my mother's skirts, did not attend to the anxious eyes that I sent her; did not seem to hear the conversation about the seminary and its consequences, and, incidentally, decorated the principal, as I learned later. Twice I went to the window, hoping she would go too, and we would be alone, until the world was over, if it was over, but Capitú did not appear to me. He did not leave my mother, but to leave. They were marauders, he said goodbye.</p><p>"Come with her, Bentinho," said my mother.</p><p>"No need, no, Don Gloria," she said, laughing, "I know the way." Goodbye, Mr. Protonotary ...</p><p>"Goodbye, Capitú."</p><p>Having taken a step to cross the room, it is clear that my duty, my taste, all the impulses of the age and of the time, were to cross it all, to follow the short corridor, to go down to the chacara, to enter the yard , give him a third kiss, and bid me farewell. I did not mind the refusal, which I took care of, and I went down the corridor; but Capitú, who was hurrying, stopped and motioned for me to return. I did not obey; I came to her.</p><p>"Do not come, do not; We'll talk tomorrow.</p><p>"But I wanted to tell you ..."</p><p>-Tomorrow.</p><p>-Listening!</p><p>-Stay!</p><p>He spoke softly; He took my hand and put his finger in the mouth. A black woman, who came from the inside to light the lantern in the corridor, saw us in that attitude, almost in the dark, laughed sympathetically and murmured in a tone that we heard something that I did not understand well or ill. Capitú told me that the slave had mistrusted, and perhaps she would tell the others. Again he told me to stay, and he withdrew; I let myself stand, nailed, clinging to the ground.</p><h2>XL - One Mare</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Being alone, I reflected some time, and had a fantasy. You already know my fantasies. I tell you about the imperial visit; I told you of this house of Engenho Novo, reproducing that of Matacavallos ... Imagination was the companion of all my existence, alive, quick, restless, sometimes shy and friendly to pack, the most capable of swallowing campaigns and campaigns, running. I think I read in Tacitus that the Iberian waters conceived by the wind; if it was not in him, it was in another ancient author, who understood keeping this belief in his books. In this particular, my imagination was a great Iberian mare; the small breeze gave him a colt, which was soon to leave Alexander's horse; but let us leave daring and improper metaphors of my fifteen years. Let's just say the case. The fantasy of that hour was to confess to my mother my loves to tell her that she had no ecclesiastical vocation. The conversation about vocation now made me whole, and while it frightened me, it opened a door for me. Yes, that's it, I thought; I will tell my mother that I have no vocation and I confess our courtship; if she doubts, I'll tell you what happened the other day, the hairstyle and the rest ... » </p><h2>XLI - A Secret Audience</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The rest made me stay in the hall for some time, thinking. I saw Doctor Joao da Costa come in, and the custom voltarete was soon prepared. My mother left the room, and, taking me in, asked if she had accompanied him. "No, ma'am, she was alone. E almost investing for her: "Mama, I wanted to tell you something. -What is? All frightened, she wanted to know what it is that hurts me, if her head, if her breast, if I stomach it, and she palpates my forehead to see if she has a fever. "I have nothing, no, ma'am. "But then what is it?" "It's a good thing, Mama. But listen, look, it's better after tea; soon ... It's not bad at all; Mother is frightened by everything; it is not a matter of care. "Is not it annoying?" "No, ma'am. "Yeah, that's about constipation. You disguise yourself not to drink sweat, but you are constipated; it is known by the voice. I tried to laugh, to show that I had nothing. She did not allow me to delay the conversation, she took me, took me to her room, lit the candle, and ordered me to tell her everything. So I asked him, to begin, when did he go to the seminary. "Only for the year after the vacation." -I'm ... to stay? - How to stay? "I'm not coming home?" -Back to the Saturdays and vacations; is better. When you order yourself priest, you come to live with me. I wiped my eyes and nose. Ella stroked me, then quizzed me, but I think her voice shook, and it seemed to me that her eyes were wet. I told him that he also felt our separation. He denied it was separation; it was just some absence because of the studies; only the first few days. In a short time I would become accustomed to the companions and the masters, and would end up enjoying living with them. "I just like Mommy. There was no calculation in this word, but I esteemed it, because it made me believe that it was my only affair; he deflected the suspicions from above Capitú. How many vicious intentions have they so embarked, midway, in an innocent and pure phrase! It even makes one suspect that lying is often as involuntary as perspiration. On the other hand, my dear reader, I note that I wanted to deflect suspicions from above Capitú, when I had called my mother just to confirm them; but the contradictions are of this world. The truth is that my mother was a candida as the first dawn, before the first sin; nor by intuition could deduce one thing from another, that is, I would not conclude from my sudden opposition that I would walk in secrets with Capitú, as Jose Dias had said to him. He was silent for a moment; then he replied to me without imposition or authority, which seemed to encourage me to resist. Then I told him about the vocation that had been discussed that afternoon, and which I confessed not to feel in me. "But you were so fond of being a priest," she said; Do not you remember that you even asked to go and see the seminarians of St. Joseph in their cassocks? At home, when Jose Dias called you Reverendissimo, you laughed so fondly! How now ...? I do not think so, Bentinho. And then ... Vocation? But the vocation comes with custom, he continued, repeating the reflections he had heard from my Latin teacher. As I sought to contest it, he reproached me without harshness, but with some strength, and I rendered the submissive son that he was. Then he spoke gravely and longingly about the promise he had made; he did not tell me the circumstances, or the occasion, or the motives of it, things which I came to know only later. He affirmed the principal, that is, that he would fulfill it, in payment to God. "Our Lord has come to me, saving your existence, I shall not lie to you, nor will I lack you, Bentinho; are things that are not done without sin, and God who is great and powerful, would not leave me like this, no, Bentinho; I know I would be punished and well punished. Being a priest is good and holy; you know many, like Father Cabral, who lives so happy with his sister; an uncle of mine was also a priest, and he escaped being a bishop, they say ... Leave it to yourself, Bentinho. I believe that the eyes I laid on her were so plaintive that she immediately amended the word; No, no, it could not be morning, she knew very well that I was her friend, and I would not be able to fake a feeling I did not have. Molly is what I wanted to say, to let me out of my hair, to make me a man and obey what I did, for the benefit of her and for the sake of my soul. All these things and others were said a little hurriedly, and the voice was not clear, but veiled and drawn. I saw that the emotion of it was once again great, but it did not retreat from its purpose, and I ventured to ask it: "What if Mom asked God to give her the promise?" "No, I will not. Are you dizzy, Bentinho? And how could I know that God would spare me? "Maybe in a dream; I dream sometimes with angels and saints. "Me too, a son; but it's useless ... Come on, it's late; lets go to the room. It is understood: on the first or second month of next year, you will go to the seminary. What I want is for you to know the books you are studying well; is beautiful, not only for you, but for Father Cabral. In the seminary you are interested in knowing yourself, because Father Cabral speaks of you with enthusiasm. He walked to the door, we left both. Before she left, she turned to me, and almost saw her jump into my lap and tell me she would not be a priest. This was already his intimate desire, as time approached. It was a way of paying off the counterpart debt, another currency, which was worth so much or more, and found none.</p><h2>XLII - Reflecting Capitu</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I went home the next day as soon as I could. Capitú took leave of three friends who had gone to see her, Paula and Sandia, schoolmates, fifteen, the seventeen years old, the first daughter of a doctor, the second of an American objects merchant. She was depressed, with a handkerchief tied around her head; the mother told me that she had been over-reading in the evening, before and after tea, in the living room and in the bed, long after midnight, and with a lamp ...</p><p>"If I set the candle on, Mom would get mad. I'm good already.</p><p>And as he unfastened the handkerchief, his mother told him timidly that it was best to get him, but Captain replied that it was not necessary, it was good.</p><p>We were alone in the living room; Capitú continued his mother's narration, adding that he had been ill because of what he had heard in my house. I also told her what to do with me, the interview with my mother, my supplications, her tears, and finally the last decisive answers: in two or three months I would go to the seminary. What would we do now? Capitú listened to me with attentive words, then somber; when I finished, he was breathing hard, as if about to snap, but he restrained himself.</p><p>It has been so long since I have been able to say with certainty whether I have cried devas, or whether I have only wiped my eyes; I believe that you have dried them up. Seeing the gesture, I took her hand to pet her, but I also needed to be excited. We fell on the settee, and stared into the air. Minto; She was staring at the floor. I did the same, as soon as I saw her like this ... But I believe that Capitú was looking inside herself, while I was looking at the ground, the roaring of the crevices, two flies walking, and one foot of a chipped chair. It was little, but I was distracted from the affliction. When I looked at Capitú again, I saw that he did not move, and I was so afraid that I shook her gently. Capitú brought me outside and asked me to tell him again what had happened to my mother. Satisfy it, attenuating the text this time, not amofinal it. Do not call me disguised, call me compassionate; it is certain that he feared to lose Capitú, if all his hopes died, but it hurts me to suffer. Now, the ultimate truth, the truth of truths, is that I already regretted having spoken to my mother, before any effective work on the part of Jose Dias; examining it well, he had not perhaps heard a disappointment that I thought was right, albeit time-consuming. Capitú reflected, reflected, reflected ...</p><h2>XLIII - Are You Afraid?</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, ceasing his reflection, he looked at my hangover eyes, and asked me if I was afraid.</p><p>-Fear?</p><p>"Yes, I ask if you're afraid."</p><p>-Fear of what?</p><p>"Long to catch, to be arrested, to fight, to walk, to work ...</p><p>I did not understand. If she has simply told me, "Let's go!" It could be that I obeyed or not; in any case, I would understand. But that question, so vague and loose, I could not see what it was.</p><p>-But I do not understand. To catch?</p><p>-Yes.</p><p>"Whose?" Who gives me a blow?</p><p>Capitú made a gesture of impatience. The hangover eyes did not move and seemed to grow. Without knowing me, and not wanting to interrogate her again, I went in to wonder where I would be beaten, and why, and also why I would be arrested, and who would arrest me. God damn it! I imagined the aljube, a dark and infected house. I also saw the presiganga, the barracks of the Barbonos and the House of Correction. All these beautiful social institutions involved me in their mysteriousness, without the hungover eyes of Capitú ceasing to grow for me, to the point that they made them forget everything. Capitú's mistake was not to let them grow infinitely, but to diminish to the normal dimensions, and to give them the usual movement. Capitú returned to what he was, told me that he was joking, he did not need to afflict me, and, with a gesture full of grace, he hit me in the house smiling, and said:</p><p>-Fearful!</p><p>-I? But...</p><p>"It's nothing, Bentinho. For who is to beat or to arrest you? Sorry I'm half crazy today; I want to play, and ...</p><p>"No, Capitú; You're not kidding; on this occasion, none of us feel like playing.</p><p>"You're right, it was just crazy; see you later.</p><p>-How farther?</p><p>"I'm getting headache again; I'm going to put a lemon slice in the springs.</p><p>He did as he was told, and he tied the handkerchief to his forehead again. Then he accompanied me to the yard to say goodbye to me; but we still sat there for a few minutes, sitting on the edge of the well. Ventava, the sky was covered. Capitú spoke again of our separation, as of a definite and definite fact, however much I, fearing it, should now seek reasons for animal. Capitú, when he did not speak, scratched the floor with a piece of taquara, noses and profiles. Ever since he had come to draw, it was one of his amusements; everything used paper and pencil. As I remembered our names opened by her on the wall, I wanted to do the same on the floor, and I asked her for the taquara. He did not listen to me or did not listen to me.</p><h2>XLIV - The First Child</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Here, let me write something down."</p><p>Capitú looked at me, but in a way that reminded me of José Dias's definition, oblique and disguised; He looked up without looking up. The voice, somewhat numb, asked me:</p><p>"Tell me something, but tell me the truth, I do not want disguise; you must respond with your heart in your hand.</p><p>-What is? Say it.</p><p>"If you had to choose between me and your mother, who would you choose?"</p><p>-I?</p><p>He nodded yes.</p><p>"I chose ... but what choice?" Mom can not ask me that.</p><p>"Yes, yes, but I ask. Suppose you are in the seminary and you receive the news that I am going to die ...</p><p>-Do not say that!</p><p>-... Or that I miss myself, if you do not come soon, and your mother does not want you to come, tell me, are you coming?</p><p>-I come.</p><p>"Against your mother's order?"</p><p>"Against Mother's order."</p><p>"You leave seminary, leave your mother, leave everything, to see me die?</p><p>"Do not talk about dying, Capitú!"</p><p>Capitú had a disbelieving, disbelieving laugh, and with the taquara he wrote a word on the floor; I bowed and read: a liar.</p><p>It was so strange that I did not find an answer. He did not understand the reason for the writing, as he did not agree with the speaker's. If there was a great or small insult to me, it is possible that I wrote it too, with the same taquara, but I could not remember anything. His head was empty. At the same time I was afraid that someone could hear or read us. Who, if we were alone? Fortunata had once arrived at the door of the house, but he entered soon after. The solitude was complete. Reminds me that a swallow passed over the yard and went to the side of the hill of Santa Theresa; no one else. In the distance, vague and confused voices, in the street a troop of beasts, on the side of the house the chirping of the birds of Padova. Nothing more, or just this curious phenomenon, that the name written by her, not only peeped me off the floor, but it even seemed to affect the air. Then I had a bad idea; I told him that, after all, the life of a priest was not bad, and I could acceital it without much pain. It was puerile, as it turned out; but I felt the secret hope that I would throw myself into tears. Capitú merely widened his eyes, and ended by saying,</p><p>"Father is good, no doubt; better than priest only, because of the purple socks. Purple is very beautiful color. Come to think of it, it's a better congo.</p><p>"But you could not be a rabbit without first being a priest," I said, biting my lips.</p><p>-Good; start with the black stockings, then the purple ones will come. What I do not want to lose is your new Mass; let me know in time to make a fashionable dress, balloon skirt and big frills ... But maybe in that time the fashion is another. The church must be large, Carmo or S. Francisco.</p><p>-Or Candelaria.</p><p>-Candelaria too. Any sip, though I hear the new Mass. I'll make a big shot. A lot of people have to ask: "Who is that cheeky girl who is wearing such a beautiful dress there?" - "That is D. Capitolina, a girl who lived in the street of Matacavallos ..."</p><p>"Who lived?" Are you going to move?</p><p>"Who knows where he lives tomorrow?" she said with a slight tone of melancholy; but turning to sarcasm: And you at the altar, in the dawn, with the gold cloak on top, singing ... Pater noster ...</p><p>Ah! how I feel not to be a romantic poet to say that this was a duel of ironies! I would count my boats and the della, the grace of one and the promptitude of another, and the blood running, and the fury in the soul, until my final blow that was this:</p><p>"Yes, Captain, you will hear my new Mass, but on one condition.</p><p>To which she replied:</p><p>Your Reverend can speak.</p><p>"Do you play a thing?"</p><p>-What is?</p><p>- Say you promise.</p><p>"Not knowing what it is, do not promise.</p><p>"Two things, to tell the truth," I went on, because another idea had come to me.</p><p>"Two?" Tell them what they are.</p><p>"The first is that you must confess with me only to give you penance and absolution." The second is that ...</p><p>"The first is promised," she said, watching me hesitate, and added that she was expecting the second.</p><p>Word that cost me, and before I did not get out of the mouth; I would not listen to what I heard, I would not write a thing here that might be unbelieving.</p><p>"The second ... yes ... is that ... Promise me to be the priest who marries you?"</p><p>Let me get married She was a little touched.</p><p>Then he lowered his lips and shook his head.</p><p>"No, Bentinho," he said, "it would be a long time; you're not going to be a priest tomorrow, it takes many years ... Look, I promise something else; I promise you'll have to baptize my first child.</p><h2>XLV - Shake Your Head, Reader</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shake your head, reader; make all the gestures of unbelief. Let this book go to bed, if boredom has not compelled it before; everything is possible. But if you have not done it before and only now, let me pick it up again from the book and open it on the same page, without believing in the truth of the author. However, there is nothing more exact. That's what Capitú said, in such words and manners. He spoke of the first child, as if it were the first doll. As for my astonishment, if it was also great, came mixed with an exquisite feeling. A fluid flowed through me. That threat of a first child, the first son of Capitú, the marriage of her with another, therefore, absolute separation, loss, annihilation, all this produced such an effect, that I found neither word nor gesture; I was stupid Capitú smiled; I saw the first son playing on the floor ... </p><h2>XLVI - Peace</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Peace was made like war, quickly. I sought in this book my glory, and I would say that the negotiations departed from me; but no, it was she who initiated them. A few moments later, as I was head down, she lowered her head, but turned her eyes up to see mine. I prayed; then I wanted to get up to leave, but I did not even get up, I do not know if I would. Capitú looked at me with such tender eyes, and the position made them so supplices, that I let myself stay, I put my arm around her waist, she took me at her fingertips, and ... </p><p>Another time D. Fortunata appeared at the door of the house; I do not know what, if he did not give me time to pull his arm; it disappeared soon. It could be a simple disclaimer of conscience, a ceremony, like the prayers of obligation, without devotion, which are said to be a crowd; unless it was to certify to his own eyes the reality that the heart told him ... </p><p>Whatever it was, my arm continued to tighten around the daughter's waist, and that's how we pacified. The beautiful thing is that each of us now wanted the guilts for ourselves, and we asked each other for forgiveness. Capitú was accompanied by insomnia, headache, the dejection of the spirit, and finally "his calundús." I, who was very crying by this time, felt his eyes wet ... It was pure love, it was the effect of the friend's ailments , was the tenderness of reconciliation. </p><h2>XLVII - "You Left"</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, that's it, I'm done; but explain one thing to me, why did you ask me if I was afraid to get it? </p><p>"It was not for nothing," said Capitú, after some hesitation. "Why bother?" </p><p>- Always say. Was it because of the seminar? </p><p>-Was; I've heard they hit them ... No? I do not think so, either. </p><p>The explanation pleased me; he had no other. If, as I think, Capitú did not tell the truth, it is hard to recognize that he could not tell her, and the lie is one of those created who make haste to respond to the visits that "you left", when you do not want to tell anyone . There is in this complicity a particular taste; the peccadillo communes for a moment the condition of the people, not counting the pleasure that gives the face of the deceived visits, and the back with which they descend ... The truth did not leave, stayed at home, in the heart of Capitú, dozing the their repentance. And I did not go down sad or angry; I find the created gallant, appealing, better than the mistress. </p><p>The swallows now came in the opposite direction, or they would not be the same. We were the same; there we are dimming our illusions, our fears, beginning to add to our homesickness. </p><h2>XLVIII - Oath of the Well</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>-No! I exclaimed suddenly.</p><p>"Not what?"</p><p>There had been a few minutes of silence, during which I reflected a lot and ended up with an idea; the tone of the exclamation, however, was so loud that it frightened my neighbors.</p><p>"It does not have to be this way," I continued. They say that we are not in the age to marry, that we are creations, creançolas, - I already heard creançolas. Good; but two or three years pass quickly. Do you swear a thing? Do you swear to marry me?</p><p>Capitú did not hesitate to swear, and I even saw his cheeks red with pleasure. He swore twice and a third:</p><p>"Even if you marry another, I will keep my oath, never marrying."</p><p>"Marry another?"</p><p>"It could be, Bentinho. You can find another girl that you want, fall in love with her and get married. Who am I to remind you of me on this occasion?</p><p>-But I swear too! I swear, Capitú, I swear to God our Lord that I will marry you. Is this enough?</p><p>"That should be enough," she said. I dare not ask for more. Yes, you swear ... But let us swear by another way; let us swear that we shall marry one another, if there be any.</p><p>You understand the difference; was more than the election of the spouse, was the affirmation of marriage. My friend's head knew how to think clearly and quickly. Actually, the previous formula was limited, only exclusive. We could end up single-minded, like the sun and the moon, without lying to the oath of the well. This formula was better, and had the advantage of strengthening my heart against the ecclesiastical investiture. We swore by the second formula, and we were so happy that all fear of danger disappeared. We were religious, we had the sky as our witness. I never even feared the seminar.</p><p>"If you are very stubborn, I will go; but I realize that it's a collegio any; I do not take orders.</p><p>Capitú feared our separation, but ended up accepting this proposal, which was the best. We did not afflict my mother, and time would run to the point where marriage could take place. On the contrary, any resistance to the seminar would confirm the denunciation of José Dias. This reflection was not mine, but it.</p><h2>XLIX - A Candle to the Sabbados</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is how, after so many years, we touched the port that we should have taken shelter soon. Do not reproach us, pilot of bad luck, do not sail hearts like the other seas of this world. We were happy, we talked about the future. I promised my wife a life socegada and beautiful, in the country or farm of the city. We would come here once a year. If it was in the suburbs, it would be far away, where no one would bother us. The house, in my opinion, should not be large or small, a middle ground; I planted her flowers, chose furniture, a seige, and an oratory. Yes, we had to have a beautiful, tall, or jacaranda oratory, with the image of Our Lady of Conception. I took longer in this than in the rest, partly because we were religious, partly to compensate for the cassock that I was going to throw the nettles: but there was still a part that attributed to the secret and unconscious intent of capturing the protection of the sky. We had to light a candle on the sabbados ... </p><h2>L - A Middle Ground</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later I went to St. Joseph's seminary. If I could count the tears that I had wept in the morning and in the morning, it would be more than all those poured out since Adam and Eve. but it is good to be emphatic, again and again, to compensate for this scrupulousness of accuracy that afflicts me. However, if I follow only the memory of sensation, I am not far from the truth; at fifteen years, everything is infinite. Really, however prepared I was, I suffered a lot. My mother also suffered, but she suffered with her heart and soul; Father Cabral had found a middle ground, to experience my vocation; if at the end of two years I did not reveal an ecclesiastical vocation, I would follow another career.</p><p>-The promises must be fulfilled as God wills. Suppose our Lord denies his son a disposition, and that the custom of the seminary does not give him the taste he gave me, it is that the divine will is another. You could not put in your son, before he was born, a vocation that Our Lord refused you ...</p><p>It was a priest's grant. I gave my mother an early pardon, making the debt relief come from the creditor. Her eyes flashed, but Bocca said no. Jose Dias, having failed to go with me to Europe, clung to the nearest, and supported the "prowess of Mr. protonotario"; it only seemed to him that a year was enough.</p><p>"I am certain," he said, winking at me, "that within a year the ecclesiastical vocation of our Bentinho is manifest and decisive. You must give a priest a full hand. Also if it does not come in a year ...</p><p>And to me, later, in particular:</p><p>"Go for a year; a year passes quickly. If you do not like it, God does not want it, as the priest says, and in this case, my friend, Europe is the best remedy.</p><p>Capitú gave me the same advice, when my mother announced his definitive trip to the seminary:</p><p>"My daughter, you're going to lose your growing partner ..."</p><p>She treated her daughter so well (it was the first time my mother had given it to her) that she did not even have time to be sad; kissed his hand, and told him that I already knew it by myself. In particular he encouraged me to support everything with patience; at the end of a year things would be changed, and a year would go by quickly. It was not yet our farewell; This was done in the evening, in a way that asks for a special chapter. The only thing I say here is that, while we were holding each other, she would arrest my mother, become more assiduous and tender, live by her, with her eyes on her. My mother was naturally sympathic, and even sensitive; it hurt as much as it pleased any thing. He found in Capitú a lot of new graces, of rare and fine gifts; gave him a ring of his and some gallantry. He did not consent to photograph himself, as the girl asked him, to give him a portrait; but he had a miniature, done at the age of twenty-five, and after some hesitation he decided to give it to him. The eyes of Capitú, when he received the mime, do not describe themselves; they were not oblique, not hungry, they were right, clear, lucid. He kissed the portrait with passion, my mother did the same thing to her. All this reminds me of our farewell.</p><h2>LI - Between Light and Twinkle</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Between light and twinkle, everything must be brief as that moment. Our farewell did not last long, it was as much as it could, at her house, in the parlor, before the candles came; That's where we say goodbye. We swore again that we were to marry one another, and it was not just the handshake that sealed the contract, as in the yard, it was the conjunction of our loving mouths ... Maybe scratch this in the impression, if not there to think of another way; if you think, stay. And from now on, because, in truth, it is our defense. What the divine commandment wants is that we should not swear in vain by the holy name of God. I was not going to lie to the seminary, since I had a contract made in the proper sky office. As for the seal, God, as he made his hands clean, so did his lips clean, and malice is in your perverse head rather than in that pair of teenagers ... Oh! my sweet companion of the boyhood, I was pure, and I was pure, and I entered into the class of St. Joseph, looking for a priestly investiture, and before his vocation. But the vocation was you, the endowment was you. </p><h2>LII - Old Padua</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I now also tell the goodbyes of old Padova. Soon he came to our house. My mother told him to come and talk to my room.</p><p>-Excuse me? he asked, stuck his head in the door.</p><p>I went to shake his hand; he hugged me tenderly.</p><p>-Be happy! he told me. To me and to all my people, I think they are very homesick. We all esteem you as you deserve. If you are told otherwise, do not believe it. They are intrigues. I, too, when I married I was a victim of intrigue; they broke up. God is great and discovers the truth. If you ever lose your mother and your uncle, it rests that I, because of this light that lodges me, does not desire, because they are good people, surplus people, and I am grateful for the fineness received ... No, I am not like others , certain parasites, coming from for disunion of the families, low flatterers, no; I am of another species; I do not live by eating dinners or living in someone else's house ... Anyway, they are the happiest!</p><p>-Why will you talk like that? I thought. Naturally he knows that Jose Dias says evil of him.</p><p>"But, as I was saying, if you ever lost your relatives, you could count on our company." It is not sufficient in importance, but the affair is immense, believe it. Father, our house is at your command. I just want you to not forget me; do not forget old Padua ...</p><p>He sighed and continued:</p><p>"Do not forget your old Padova, and if you have any little trap left in my memory, a Latin notebook, anything, a button-top, something that will not do you any good." Courage is the memory.</p><p>I had a start. I had wrapped in a paper a bunch of my hair, so large and beautiful, cut in the evening. The intention was to take them to Capitú on his way out; but I had the idea of ​​giving him to the father, the daughter would know him and guard him. I took the package and gave it to him.</p><p>"Here you go, put it away.</p><p>"A haircut!" exclaimed Padua, opening and closing the package. Oh! thank you! Thank you for me and my people! I will give it to the old woman, to guard it, or to the little one, who is more careful than the mother. How beautiful they are! How do you cut a beauty of these? Give me a hug! other! another! goodbye!</p><p>His eyes were damp; he took the face of the disillusioned, as if he had used all his savings of hope in a single ticket, and he sees the damn number go white, -a number so beautiful!</p><h2>LIII - On My Way</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I went to the seminary. Spare me the other farewells. My mother clutched my chest. Prima Justina sighed. Maybe I cried badly or nothing. There are people whose tears do not come soon or ever; they are said to suffer more than others. Prima Justina naturally disguised her inner pains, correcting my mother's carelessness, making recommendations to me, giving orders. Uncle Cosimo, when I kissed him goodbye, said to me with a laugh:</p><p>"Come on, boy, come back to me, Papa!"</p><p>José Dias, composed and serious, did not say anything at first; we had spoken in the evening, in the room of the room, where I went to see if it was still possible to avoid the seminary. It was no longer, but it gave me hope and especially excited me. Before a year we would be on board. As I found it very brief, he explained.</p><p>"They say it's not a good time to cross the Atlantic, I'll ask; if it is not, we will be in March or April.</p><p>"I can study medicine right here.</p><p>Jose Dias ran his fingers through his suspenders with a gesture of impatience, pressed his lips together, until he formally rejected the proposal.</p><p>"I would not hesitate to approve the idea," he said, "if they did not teach Allopatha rot only in the medical school." Allopathia is the error of centuries, and it is going to die; It's murder, it's the lie, it's the illusion. If you are told that you can take part of the science common to all systems in the medical school, it is true; allopathia is a mistake in therapeutics. Physiology, anatomy, pathology, are neither allopathic nor homeopathic, but it is better to apprehend it all at once, by books and by language of men who practice truth ...</p><p>That was how he had spoken in the evening and in the bedroom. Now he said nothing, or uttered some aphorism about religion and family; I remember this: "Divide him with God, he is still possessed." When my mother gave me the last kiss: "Frame dearly!" he sighed. It was a beautiful morning. The boys whispered; the slaves took the blessing: "Blessing, no Bentinho! do not forget your Joanna! Your Miquelina prays for you! "In the street Jose Dias insisted on the hopes:</p><p>-Add a year; By then everything will be arranged.</p><h2>LIV - Panegyrico of Santa Maria</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>No seminar ... Ah! I will not tell the seminar, nor would I have a chapter. No, sir, my friend; some day, yes, it is possible that I compose an abbreviation of what I saw and lived there, of the people I treated, of customs, of everything else. This scabbard of writing, when picked up at the age of fifty, does not take off anymore. In youth it is possible to cure a man of it; and, without going any further, right here in the seminary I had a companion who compose verses, in the manner of those of Junqueira Freire, whose poet friar's book was recent. He was ordained: I met him in Saint Peter's court and asked him to show me the new verses.</p><p>"What verses?" he asked, startled.</p><p>-Yours. Because you do not remember that in the seminary ...</p><p>-Oh! he smiled.</p><p>He smiled, and continuing to look in an open book for the time he had to sing the next day, he confessed to me that he had not done any more verses after being ordained. It was youthful tickling; it scratched, it went, it was good. And he spoke to me in prose of an infinity of things of the day, the expensive life, a sermon of the priest X ... a Minas Gerais vigairaria ...</p><p>Contrary to this was a seminarian who did not pursue a career. It was called ... No need to say the name; suffice the case. He had composed a Panegyrico of Santa Monica, praised by some people and then read among the seminarians. He obtained a license to print it, and dedicated it to St. Augustine. All this is old history; what is younger is that one day, in 1882, going to see a certain business in naval division, there I found this colleague, made head of an administrative section. He had left a seminary, left letters, married, and forgotten everything except the Panegyrico of Santa Monica, some twenty-nine pages, which he had distributed throughout life. As I needed some information, I went to ask them, and it would be impossible to find any better or more prompting; gave me everything, of course, right, copious. Of course we talked about the past, people's memories, case studies, incidents of nothing, a book, a verb, a motto, all the old stuff came out here, and we laughed together, and we sighed in company. We lived some time in our old seminary. Or because they were from him, or because we were young, the memories brought such a power of happiness that, if any contrary shadow happened then, it did not appear now. Elle confessed that he had lost sight of all the companions of the seminary.</p><p>"Me, almost everyone; once ordained, returned naturally to their provinces, and those here took up their errands.</p><p>-Good time! he sighed.</p><p>And after some reflection, looking at me with dull and stubborn eyes, he asked me:</p><p>"Did you keep my Panegyrico?"</p><p>I did not think to say; I tried to move my lips, but I had no word; after all, I asked:</p><p>-Panegyrico? What a panegyric?</p><p>- My Panegyrico of Santa Monica.</p><p>He did not immediately remind me, but the explanation should suffice; and after a few moments of mental research, I replied that I had kept it for a long time, but the changes, the travels ...</p><p>"I'll bring you a copy."</p><p>Before twenty-four o'clock I was in my house, with the booklet, an old booklet of twenty-six years, grimy, stained of time, but without a gap, and with a handwritten and respectful dedication.</p><p>"And the penultimate copy," he told me; now I only have one, which I can not give to anyone.</p><p>And as he saw me leaf through the opusculo:</p><p>"See if you can remember a bit," he told me.</p><p>Twenty-six years of intervallo make friends die closer and assiduous, but it was cortezia, it was quasi charity to remember some lauda; I read one of them, accentuating certain phrases to give it the impression that they found echo in my memory. He agreed that they were beautiful, but he preferred others, and pointed them out.</p><p>"Do you remember well?"</p><p>-Perfectly. Panegyric of Santa Monica! How this brings me back to the years of my youth! I've never forgotten the seminary, believe me. The years pass, the events come over each other, and the sensations also, and new friends came, who also left later, as is the law of life ... For, my dear colleague, did not erase that time of our coexistence, the priests, the licenses, the recreations ... our recreations, remember? Father Lopes, oh! Father Lopes ...</p><p>Elle, with her eyes in the air, must have been listening, and of course she listened, but she only said a word to me, and yet after some quiet time, looking up and sighing!</p><p>"You're very pleased with my Panegyrico!"</p><h2>LV - A Sonnet</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Saying the word, he shook hands with all the strength of a large thank-you, said goodbye, and left. I was alone with the Panegyrico, and what the leaves of it reminded me was such that it deserves a chapter or more. Before, however, and because I also had my Panegyrico, I will tell the story of a sonnet I never did; was in the time of the seminary, and the first verse is what ides read:</p><p>Oh! flower of the sky oh! pure candor</p><p>How and why this verse came out of my head, I do not know; he left like that, lying on the bed like a loose exclamation, and when he noticed that he had the measure of verse, I thought of composing with him some thing, a sonnet. The insomnia, a muse with wide eyes, did not let me sleep a long hour or two; the tickles asked for nails, and I itched with soul. I did not choose soon, soon the sonnet; at first I took care of another form, both rhyme and loose verse, but after all I activated myself to the sonnet. It was a brief, helpful poem. As for the idea, the first verse was not yet an idea, it was an exclamation; the idea would come later. So in bed, wrapped in the sheet, I tried to poet. There was the uproar of the mother who feels the son, and the first child. He was going to be a poet, he was going to compete with that monk from Bahia, just before revealed, and then in fashion; I, a seminarian, would say in verse my sorrows, as he had said his in the cloister. I decorated the verse well, and repeated it in a low voice, to the sheets; frankly, I thought he was handsome, and even now I do not think it's bad:</p><p>Oh! flower of the sky oh! pure candor</p><p>Who was the flower? Capitú, of course; but it could be virtue, poetry, religion, any other concept that would fit the metaphor of the flower, and of the sky. I waited for the rest, always reciting the verse, and lying now on the right side, now on the left; Atinai, I let myself be on my back with my eyes on the ceiling, but nothing came. Then I warned that the most boastful sonnets were the ones that concluded with the golden key, that is, one of those verses capitaes in the sense and the form. I thought of forging one of these keys, considering that the final verse, quoting chronologically from the previous thirteen, would in fact bring the praised perfection; I imagined that these keys were cast before the lock. So it was that I determined to compose the last verse of the sonnet, and after much sweating, this one came out:</p><p>You lose your life, you win the battle!</p><p>Without vanity, and speaking as if from another, it was a magnificent verse. Sound, no doubt. And he had a thought, victory won at the expense of his own life, noble and noble thinking. That it was not new, it is possible, but it was not vulgar either; and even now I do not explain why mysterious way entered a head so few years. At that time I found it sublime. I recited one and many times the golden key; then repeated the two verses in a row, and arranged to bind them by twelve cent. The idea now, in view of the last verse, it seemed to me better not to be Capitú; it would be justice. It was more proper to say that, in the struggle for justice, life would be lost, but the battle was won. I also happened to accept the battle, in the natural sense, and to make the squid for the homeland, for example; in this case the flower of the sky would be freedom. This acceptance, however, being the poet a seminarian, might not fit as much as the first, and I spent a few minutes choosing one or the other. I thought justice better, but at last I accepted a new idea, charity, and recited the two verses, each one a way, a languid one:</p><p>Oh! flower of the sky oh! pure candor</p><p>and the other with great delight:</p><p>You lose your life, you win the battle!</p><p>The feeling I had was that a perfect sonnet would come out. Starting well and ending well was no small matter. To give me a shower of inspiration, I conjured up some celebrated sonnets, and I noticed that most of them were easy; the verses came out of each other, with the idea itself, so naturally, that it was not possible to believe if she had done them, if they had aroused her. Then I would return to my sonnet, and again repeat the first line and wait for the second; the second came neither third nor fourth; there was none. I had some imitations of anger, and more than once I thought of getting out of bed and going to see ink and paper; It could be that, by writing, the verses came, but ...</p><p>Weary of waiting, he reminded me to change the meaning of the last verse, with the simple transposition of the two words, thus:</p><p>You win the life, you lose the battle!</p><p>The sense was just the opposite, but perhaps that would even bring inspiration. In this case, it was an irony: not exercising charity, one could earn a living, but one loses the battle of the sky. I created new forces. I waited for him. There was no window; If he did, he might ask for an idea at night. And who knows if the fireflies, shining down below, would not be to me like the rhymes of the stars, and this living metaphora would not give me the elusive verses, with their consonants and their own senses?</p><p>I worked in vain, I searched, I read, I waited, the verses did not come. For some time I wrote some pages in prose, and now I am composing this narration, finding no greater difficulty than writing, good or bad. For, sirs, nothing comforts me of that sonnet I did not do. But as I believe that sonnets are made, such as odes and dramas, and other works of art, for a metaphysical order, I give these two verses to the first unoccupied person who wants them. On Sunday, or if it is raining, or on the farm, at any leisure time, you can try to see if the sonnet leaves. All is to give you an idea and fill the missing center.</p><h2>LVI - A Seminarian</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>All I was repeating the devil of the opusculo, with his old letters and Latin quotations. I have seen many leaves of seminarians come out of the leaves, the Albuquerques brothers, for example, one of whom is a congo in Bahia, while the other followed medicine and said to have discovered a specific one against yellow fever. I saw Bastos, a magricella, who is a vicar at Meia-Ponte, if he has not already died; Luiz Borges, in spite of being a priest, became a politician, and he became a senator of the empire ... How many other faces looked at me from the cold pages of the Panegyrico! No, they were not cold; brought the heat of the nascent youth, the heat of the past, my own heat. He wanted to read them again, and he could understand some text, as fresh as on the first day, but shorter. It was lovely to go for him; sometimes, unconsciously, he folded the sheet as if he were actually reading; I believe it was when my eyes fell on the word at the bottom of the page, and the hand, accustomed to helping them, did their job ... Here is another seminarian. His name was Ezequiel de Souza Escobar. He was a slender boy, clear eyes, a little fugitive, like his hands, like his feet, like speech, like everything. Anyone who was not accustomed to him might feel ill, not knowing where to get him. He did not look at his face, he did not speak clearly or often; the hands did not squeeze the others, nor did they let themselves be squeezed, because the fingers, being thin and short, when we took care of them among theirs, had nothing. The same I say of the feet, that they were so quickly here as there. This difficulty in landing was the greatest obstacle he had to take to the seminary customs. The smile was instantaneous, but it laughed, too. One thing would not be as fugitive as the rest, the reflection; We were going to find him, too, with his eyes fixed on himself, wondering. He answered-nus whenever he meditated on some spiritual point, or that he remembered the license of the evening. When he entered my intimacy he often asked me for explanations and small repetitions, and he had memory to guard them all, even the words. Perhaps this faculty harmed some other. </p><p>He was older than I was three years old, the son of a lawyer from Corityba, who was related to a merchant from Rio de Janeiro, who served as correspondent to the father. He was a man of strong Catholic sentiment. Escobar had a sister, who was an angel, he said. </p><p>"It is not only in beauty that he is an angel, but also in kindness. Can not imagine what a good creature she is. Write me a lot, I'll show you her letters. </p><p>In fact, they were simple and affectionate, full of caresses and advice. Escobar would tell me stories of it, interesting, all that came to give in the goodness and the spirit of that creature; These were the ones that would make me able to end up marrying her, if it was not for Capitú. He died shortly thereafter. I, seduced by his words, almost immediately told him my story. At first I was shy, but he got himself into my confidence. These fugitive ways ceased when he wanted, and the middle and the time made them more rested. Escobar came and opened his whole soul from the front door to the back of the yard. The soul of the people, as you know, and a house so arranged, not infrequently with windows on all sides, much light and fresh air. It has also been closed and dark, without windows, or with few and barred, like convents the prisons. Otrosim, capellas and bazaars, simple porches or sumptuous palaces. </p><p>I do not know what mine was. I was not yet casmurro, nor dom boom; the fear was that I was being frank, but since the doors had no keys or locks, I simply pushed them, and Escobar pushed them out and entered. I found it inside, stayed here, until ... </p><h2>LVII - Preparation</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ah! but it was not only the seminarians who came out of those old leaves of the Panegyrico. They also brought me past sensations, so many that I could not tell them all, without taking away the rest. One of these, and one of the first ones, I might have contented here with Latin. It is not that matter does not find us honest in our language, which is chaste for the chaste ones, as it could be awkward for the dull. Yes, reader of the castissima, as my late Jose Dias would say, you can read the chapter to the end without fright or vexation. </p><p>I already set the story in another chapter. No matter how much I get out of it, there is always something less austere in the subject, which calls for a few lines of rest and preparation. Serve this in preparation. And this is too much, reader my friend; the heart, when it examines the possibility of what is to come. the proportions of events and the copy of them, is strong and disposed, and evil is less evil. Also, if it does not stay then, it never stays. And here you will see how clever I am; for as you read what you read, it is probable that you are less raw than you expected. </p><h2>LVIII - The Treaty</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was the case that one Monday, when I returned to the seminary, I saw a lady fall in the street. My first gesture, in such a case, must have been pity or laughter; it was neither, for (and this is what I meant to say in Latin) because you had your socks washed and did not dirty them, you wore garters of silk and did not lose them. Several people came, but they did not have time to raise it; She stood up very much in agony, shook herself, thanked him, and headed down the next street.</p><p>"This taste of imitating the French of Ouvidor Street," Jose Dias told me, walking and commenting on the fall, "is evidently a mistake. Our girls must walk as they have always walked, with me I am wandering and patience, and not this tic-tique afranzo ...</p><p>I could barely hear him. The lady's socks and garters bleached and curled up before me, and they walked, fell, rose, and left. When we arrived at the corner, I looked at the other street, and I saw, from a distance, our disgust, who went at the same pace, ticked, ticked ...</p><p>"You do not seem to have hurt yourself," I said.</p><p>"So much the better for her, but it is impossible that she did not scratch her knees; that promptness is morning</p><p>I think it was "morning" that he said; I stood on my knees scratched. Dalli in deante, until the seminary, I did not see a woman in the street, who did not want a pain; to some I guessed that he was wearing stockings and tight leashes ... That would not even wear socks ... But I saw them with them ... Or ... It's also possible ...</p><p>I am retracting this with reticence, to give an idea of ​​my ideas, which were thus diffused and confused; I certainly do not give a damn. My head was going hot, and the floor was not safe. At the seminar, the first hour was unbearable. The cassocks bore air with skirts, and they reminded me of the lady's. I was no longer one I saw fall; all the ones I had met on the street, were now glinting at the blue leagues; were blue. At night I dreamed of them. A multitude of abominable creatures came to walk around me, ticking ... They were beautiful, some thin, some thick, all of you act like the devil. I nodded, tried to scowl them up with hideousness and other methods, but I slept as quickly as they did, and with their hands clasped around me, they made a wide circle of skirts, or, in the air, they rained feet and legs over mine head. So I went until dawn. I did not sleep anymore; I prayed to our Father, Marguerites, and creeds, and this book being the pure truth, it is a force to confess that I had to interrupt more than once my prayers to follow in the dark a figure in the distance, tick-tick, tick-tick ... She would pick up the prayer quickly, always in the middle, to arrange it well, as if there had been no interruption, but certainly not the old phrase.</p><p>Coming evil in the morning, I tried to beat him, but in a way that did not lose him at all. Sages of scripture, guess what could be. That's it. Not being able to reject those pictures from me, I resorted to a treatise between my conscience and my imagination. Feminine visions would henceforth be regarded as mere incarnations of vices, and therefore even contemplable, as the best way of tempering the character and warring it for the harsh battles of life. I did not put it into words, nor was I precise; the contract was made tacitly, with some disgust, but it was done. And for a few days, it was I myself who evoked the visions to strengthen me, and I did not reject them, except when they, in their own way, went away.</p><h2>LIX - You Live With a Good Memory</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>There are those reminiscences that do not rest before the penna or the language publishes them. An old man used to say that he has a good memory. Life is full of such people, and I am one of them, although the proof of having a weak memory is exactly do not come to me now the name of such an ancient; but it was an old one, and that's enough. </p><p>No, no, my memory is not good. On the contrary, it is comparable to someone who had lived in hostels, without saving them nor faces or names, and only rare circumstances. To those who spend their lives in the same family home, with their eternal furniture and customs, people and affinities, is recorded by everything for continuity and repetition. How I envy those who did not forget the color of the first trousers they wore! I can not match the one I made. I swear they were not yellow because I do this color; but this could be forgetfulness and confusion. </p><p>And rather be forgetful than confusion; I explain myself. Nothing fits well in the confused books, but everything could be found in the books that are omitted. I, when I read some of this other caste, never regret it. What I do, in the end, is to close my eyes and evoke all the things I did not find in it. How many fine ideas do I have then! What deep thoughts! The rivers, the mountains, the meadows I have not seen on the leaves read, all appear to me now with their waters, their trees, their altars, and the generaes draw from the swords that had remained in the scabbard, and the bugles release the notes who slept in the metal, and everything went with an unforeseen soul. </p><p>It's just that everything is from a flawed book, a friendly reader. Thus I fill in the gaps of others; so you can also fill mine. </p><h2>LX - Dear Opusculo</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>So I did to the Panegyrico of Santa Monica, and did more: he told her not only what was missing from the saint, but still things that were not of her. You see the sonnet, the socks, the garters, the seminarist Escobar and several others. Go now to see the more that day I left the yellow pages of the opusculo. Dear opusculo, you were not good for anything, but what more do you lend an old pair of slippers? However, there is a lot in the couple of chinellas one like aroma and heat of two feet. Spent and broken, they can not fail to remember that a person wore them in the morning, when he got up from the bed, or barefoot them at night when he entered her. And if the comparison is not valid, because the chinellas are still a part of the person and had the contact of the feet, here are other souvenirs, such as the stone of the street, the door of the house, a private whistle, a prégão de quitanda, like that one of the cocadas that I counted in cap. XVIII. Precisely, when I counted the cup of cocadas, I was so badly missed that he reminded me to make him write for a friend, a master of music, and grudge him to the legs of the chapter. If I then jiggled the chapter, it was because another musician, to whom I showed him, he confessed to me naively not to find in the written passage anything that he would miss. Lest the same happens to other professionals who may read me, it is better to spare the publisher of the book the work and the removal of the engraving. You see that you do not put anything, nor do I put it on. Now, I believe, it is not enough that the street markets, like the seminary opuscuits, should bring cases, people, and sensations to a close; it is necessary that we have known them and suffered in time, without which everything is silent and colorless. </p><p>But, let's go to the more that I left the yellow pages. </p><h2>LXI - The Homer Vaccine</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The plus was plenty. I saw the first days of separation leave, hard and opaque, yet the words of comfort given me by priests and seminarians, and those of my mother and uncle Cosme brought by José Dias to the seminary.</p><p>"Everyone is longing," said he, "but the greatest longing is naturally in the greatest of hearts; and what is he? he asked, writing the reply in his eyes.</p><p>"Mother, I came.</p><p>Jose Dias shook my hands with excitement, and then he painted the sadness of my mother, who talked about me every day, almost every hour. As I always approached her and added a word to the gifts God had given me, my mother's fading on these occasions was indescribable; and told me all this full of a tearful admiration. Uncle Cosme was also very fond of it.</p><p>"There's even an interesting case. Having told Excellentissima that God had given him, not a son, but an angel of the sky, the doctor was so moved that he could find no other way to overcome the crying than by making me one of those compliments of gallantry that only he knows. It goes without saying that Dona Gloria furtively wiped away a tear. Or she was not a mother! What a heart, my love!</p><p>-But, Mr. José Dias, and my departure from here?</p><p>-This is my business. The trip to Europe is what it takes, but it could be done in one or two years, in 1859 or 1860 ...</p><p>-So late!</p><p>"It was better this year, but we gave time to time. Have patience, go study, do not miss anything to go knowing something here from here; and, still, not finishing priest, the life of the seminary is useful, and it is always worth entering the world anointed with the holy oils of theology ...</p><p>At this point, "he reminds me as if it were today," Jose Dias's eyes flashed so intensely that they filled me with astonishment. The eyelids fell afterwards, and so they remained for a few moments, until they rose again, and their eyes fixed on the wall of the stage, as if they were soaked in something, if not in themselves; then they broke off the wall and began to wander around the whole boot. I could compare it here to Homer's vacancy; he walked and moaned around the baby he had just given birth. I did not ask him what he had, because of shyness, because two glasses, one of theology, were coming toward us. As they passed us, the guest, who knew them, courted them with the appropriate deference, and asked them for news of me.</p><p>"For now nothing could be made," said one of them, "but it looks like he'll take care of the hand."</p><p>"That's what I told you right now," said Jose Dias. I'm counting on hearing the new Mass; but even if he does not get his order, he could not have better studies than he does here. For the journey of existence, he concluded by delaying more words, he will anoint with the holy oils of theology ...</p><p>This time the eyes were dimmed, the eyelids did not fall, nor did the pupils make the previous movements. On the contrary, all of it was attention and questioning; at most, a clear, friendly smile eroded his lips. The lens of theology liked the metaphora, and said it lh'o; he thanked her, explaining that they were ideas that escaped him in the course of the conversation; neither wrote nor prayed. I did not like it at all; and as soon as the glasses were gone, I shook my head.</p><p>"I do not want to know the holy oils of theology; I want to get out of here as soon as I can, or ...</p><p>"Oh, my angel, it could not be; but it may have happened sooner than we imagined. Who knows if this same year 58? I have a plan made, and I already think in the words with which I will expose it to D. Gloria; I'm sure she'll give in and go with us.</p><p>"I doubt that Mom will board."</p><p>-We'll see. Mother is capable of everything; but with her or without her, I'm sure our going, and there will be no effort that I do not employ, let it be. Patience is what it takes. And do not do anything here that would lead to censure or complaint; a lot of docility and all the apparent satisfaction. Did not you hear the eulogy of the lens? And that you have behaved well. Keep going.</p><p>"But, 1859 or 1860, it's too late.</p><p>"It will be this year," replied Jose Dias.</p><p>"Three months from now?"</p><p>-Or six.</p><p>-No; three months</p><p>-Yes, yes. I have now a plan, which seems better to me than any other. It is to combine the absence of ecclesiastical vocation and the need to change the air. Why do not you cough?</p><p>"Why not tusso?"</p><p>"No, I will not, but I will tell you to cough, when I need, little by little, a dry cough, and some annoyance; I will prepare the Excellentissima ... Oh! all this is for her benefit. Since the child could not serve the church, how it should be served, the best way to accomplish the will of God is to dedicate it to something else. The world is also a church for the good ...</p><p>It seemed to me once again that Homer was vaccinated, as if this "world is also a church for the good," was another calf, brother of the "holy oils of theology." But I did not spare the maternal tenderness, and I replied:</p><p>-Oh! I understand! Show me that I'm sick to board, is not it?</p><p>Jose Dias hesitated a little, then explained:</p><p>"To show the truth, because, frankly, Bentinho, I've been suspicious of you for months. You do not walk well from the chest. As a child, he had a fever and a snoring ... Everything happened, but there are days when he is more discolored. I do not say that it is already evil, but evil can come quickly. At an hour falls to the house. So if that holy lady does not want to go with us, or to go faster, I think a good cough ... If the cough is to come from the truth, it is better to hasten it ... Let it be, I warn you ...</p><p>"Well, I'm not going to get out of here soon; I leave first, then we'll take care of the shipment; the shipment could stay for the year. Do not say the best time is April or May? Well be it May. First I leave the seminary, two months from now ...</p><p>And because the word was making my throat clear in my throat, I turned around quickly, and asked him at once:</p><p>-Capitú, how's it going?</p><h2>LXII - A Tip of the Lake</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The question was reckless at the time when I was careful to transfer the shipment. He was inclined to confess that the main or only motive of my repulsion to the seminary was Capitú, and to make the trip unlikely. I understood this after I had spoken; he tried to mend me, but I did not know how, nor did he give me time.</p><p>"He's been as happy as ever; You're a fool. Aquillo, as long as he does not take some mountain range from the neighborhood, marry her ...</p><p>I am soaked; At least I felt a chill run through my body. The news that she lived happily, when I cried every night, produced that effect, accompanied by a heart-beating, so violent that I still care for it now. There is some exaggeration in this; but the human discourse is like that, a compound of excessive parts and tiny parts, which compensate, adjust. On the other hand, if we understand that the audience here is not from the ears, but from the memory, we will arrive at the exact truth. My memory still hears the thud of the heart now. Do not forget it was the emotion of first love. I almost asked José Dias to explain to me the joy of Capitú, what she was doing, whether she was laughing, singing or jumping, but I held back in time, and then another idea ...</p><p>Another idea, no, a cruel and unknown feeling, pure jealousy, reader of my insides. This was what bit me when I repeated the words of Jose Dias: "Some mountain of the neighborhood." In truth, he had never thought of such a disaster. It lived so in her, for her and for her, that the intervention of a peralta was like a notion without reality; it never occurred to me that there were cantons in the neighborhood, various age and form, great walkers of the afternoons. Now I remembered that some were looking at Capitú, "and I felt so delighted that it was as if they were looking at me, a simple duty of admiration and envy. Separated from each other by space and destiny, evil appeared to me now, not only possible, but right. And the joy of Capitú confirmed the suspicion; if she lived happily and that she was already dating another, she would accompany him with her eyes in the street, tell her the window, the maroons, exchange flowers and ...</p><p>Is that? You know what they would trade more; if you do not find it for yourself, it is unnecessary to read the rest of the chapter and the book, you will not find anything else, although I say it with all the letters of the etymology. But if you have found it, you will understand that I, after shuddering, had an urge to throw myself out the gate, to descend the rest of the slope, to run, to reach the house of Padua, to seize Capitú, and to tell him to confess to me how many, how many , how many had already given him the edge of the neighborhood. I did not do nothing. The same dreams that now tell the story did not have, in those three or four minutes, this logic of movements and thoughts. They were loose, mended and badly mended, with the truncated and crooked design, a confusion, a whirlwind, that blinded and deafened me. When I returned to him, Jose Dias concluded a phrase, whose beginning I did not hear, and the same end was vague: "The account that will give of itself." What account and who? I naturally took care that he was still talking about Capitú, and he wanted to ask him, but the will died at birth, like so many generations of them. I merely inquired of the addressee when I would go home to see my mother.</p><p>"I miss Mother." Can I go already this week?</p><p>"Come on.</p><p>-Habber? Ah! Yes! Yes! Ask Mom to send for me Saturday! Saturday! This Saturday, right? That you send for me, without fail.</p><h2>LXIII - Halves of a Dream</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I was anxious for the Sabbath. Until then dreams pursued me, still accorded, and I do not tell you here not to stretch this part of the book. One put, and in the smallest number of words, or rather two, because one was born of another, unless both are two halves of one. All this is obscure, lady reader, but it is the fault of your sex, which upset the adolescence of a poor seminarian. If it were not for him, and this book would perhaps be a simple parochial practice, if I were a priest, or a pastoral, bishop, or an encyclical, pope, as Uncle Cosme had told me: "Come on, my boy, turn me pope Ah! Why did I not fulfill this desire? After Napoleon, lieutenant and emperor, all destinies are in this century.</p><p>As for the dream, that was it. As I was peering out at the peaks of the neighborhood, I saw one of them talking to my friend at the foot of the window. I ran at the log, he ran away; I advanced to Capitú, but he was not alone, he had the pae at his feet, wiping his eyes and looking at a sad lottery ticket. Not seeming this clear to me, I would ask for the explanation, when he gave it of himself; the peralta had taken him the list of lottery prizes, and the ticket had gone white. It had the number 4004. It told me that this symmetry of figures was mysterious and beautiful, and probably the wheel is wrong; it was impossible that he should not have great luck. While he was speaking, Captain gave me with my eyes all sorts of great and small. The largest of these should be given with the bocca. And here comes the second part of the dream. Padua disappeared, as did his hopes for the ticket. Captain leaned forward, I glanced down the street, it was deserted. I took it in my hands, grunted, I do not know what words, and I came to the bedroom alone.</p><p>The interest of what you have just read is not in the matter of the dream, but in the efforts I made to see if I slept again and picked it up again. You can never know the energy and obstinacy I used to close my eyes, to open them well, to forget everything to sleep, but I did not sleep. This same work made me lose sleep until dawn. About dawn, I managed to conciliate him, but then neither cantalls, lottery tickets, nor lots big or small, - nothing of the natives came to have me. I no longer dreamed that night, and I gave the wrongs of that day.</p><h2>LXIV - An Idea and a Scruple</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rereading the last chapter, give me an idea and a scruple. The scrupulous is precisely to write the idea, not being more banal in the earth, than of that banality of the sun and the moon, which the sky gives us every day and every month. I left the manuscript, and looked at the walls. You know that this house of Engenho Novo, in dimensions, dispositions and paintings, is a reproduction of my old house in Matacavallos. Especially, as I told you in Chapter II, my end in imitating the other was to connect the two ends of life, which I have not attained. For it was the dream of the seminary, however much it tried to sleep and sleep. From which I conclude that one of the offices of the man is to close and squeeze his eyes a lot, to see if it continues in the old night the truncated dream of the young night. Such is the banal and new idea that I did not intend to put here, and only provisionally write it.</p><p>Before concluding this chapter, I went to the window to inquire into the night why the dreams must be so faint that they will be broken at the slightest opening of eyes or coming back from the body, and they will not continue. The night did not answer me soon. She was deliciously beautiful, the hills paled with moonlight, and the space died of silence. As I insisted, he told me that the dreams no longer belong to his jurisdiction. When they lived on the island Luciano gave them, where she had her palace, and where she made them leave with their faces in varying ways, she would give me possible explanations. But times have changed everything. The old dreams have been retired, and the modern ones live in the person's brain. These, though they might imitate others, could not do it; the island of dreams, like the island of love, like all the islands of all seas, are now the object of the ambition and rivalry of Europe and the United States.</p><p>It was an allusion to the Fillipinas. Because I do not love politics, and even less international politics, I closed the window and came to finish this chapter to go to sleep. I do not ask now for Luciano's dreams, nor for others, children of memory or digestion; just a quiet, muted sound. In the morning, with the fresh, I will tell the story of my story and its people.</p><h2>LXV - A Secret</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sabbath arrived, and other sabbados arrived, and I ended up liking the new life. I alternated the house and the seminary. The priests liked me, the boys too, and Escobar more than the boys and the parents. At the end of five weeks I was almost telling my pains and hopes; Capitú restrained me.</p><p>"Escobar is very my friend, Capitú!"</p><p>"But you are not my friend.</p><p>"It could be; He told me to come here to meet Mama.</p><p>-Does not matter; you have no right to tell a secret that is not only yours, but mine, and I do not give you permission to say anything to anyone.</p><p>It was fair, I kept quiet and obeyed. Another thing I obeyed in her reflections was, on the first Saturday when I went to her house, and after a few minutes of conversation she advised me to leave.</p><p>"Do not stay here any longer today; go home, I'll be there soon. It is natural that D. Gloria wants to be with you a lot of time, or everything, if she can.</p><p>In all this I showed my friend so much lucidity that I could not fail to mention a third example, but the examples were only made to be quoted, and this is so good that omission would be a crime. It was my third or fourth visit to the house. My mother after I answered the thousand questions she asked me about the treatment they gave me, studies, relationships, discipline, and if I hurt something, and if I slept well, all that the tenderness of the mothers invents to bounce the patience of a son, he concluded, turning to Jose Dias:</p><p>-Sr. Jose Dias, do you still doubt that a good priest will leave here?</p><p>-Most excellent . . . </p><p>"And you, Capitú, interrupted my mother by turning to the daughter of Padua who was in the room with her," do not you think our Bentinho will give a good priest? "</p><p>"I think so, madam," said Capitú, full of conviction.</p><p>I did not like conviction. So I told him the next morning in the backyard of the house, remembering the words of the evening, and for the first time the joy she had shown me from the moment I entered the seminary, when I lived with longing. Capitú became very serious, and asked me how he wanted us to behave, since they suspected us; she had also had disconsolate nights, and the days in her house were as sad as mine; he could inquire of the father and mother. The mother even told him, in secret words, that she should not think of me any more.</p><p>"With D. Gloria and D. Justina, I am naturally cheerful, so that it does not appear that the denunciation of Jose Dias is true. If it seemed, they would try to separate us more, and perhaps they would not receive me.... For me, our oath is sufficient that we are to marry one another.</p><p>That was it; we should dissemble to kill any suspicion, and at the same time to enjoy all the previous freedom, and build tranquil our future. But the example is complete with what I heard the next day at lunch; my mother, telling Uncle Cosme that she still wanted to see what hand she could give to blessing the people to Mass, said that days before, when she was talking about young girls getting married early, Capitú had said to her: to marry must be Father Bentinho; I hope he is commanded! "Uncle Cosimo laughed with grace, Jose Dias did not desorb, only cousin Justina frowned, and looked at me interrogatively. I, who had looked at all, could not resist the gesture of the cousin, and I tried to eat. But I ate badly; I was so pleased with that great dissembling of Capitú that I saw nothing else, and as soon as I had lunch, I ran to tell him the conversation and to praise his cunning. Capitú smiled gratefully.</p><p>"You're right, Capitú," I concluded; Let's fool all these people.</p><p>-It is not? she said ingenuously.</p><h2>LXVI - Intimacy</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Capitú was now entering my mother's soul. They lived together most of the time, talking about me, about sun and rain, or about nothing; Capitú was going to sew in the mornings; I used to stay for dinner.</p><p>Prima Justina did not accompany the kinswoman in those delicacies, but she did not treat my friend with any harm. She was very sincere to say the evil she felt of someone, and felt no good of any person. Maybe her husband, but her husband was dead; in any case, there was no man capable of competing with him in affinity, in work and in honesty, in manners and wit. This opinion, according to Uncle Cosme, was posthuma, for in life they were in quarrels, and the last six months were separated. So much the better for her justice; the praise of the dead is a way of praying for them. I would like my mother too, or if some bad thought of her was between her and the pillow. It is understood that, as a matter of fact, he should give it due consideration. I do not think she aspired to any legacy; the persons thus disposed exceed the natural services, they become more smiling, more assiduous, multiply the care, precede the famulos. All this was contrary to the nature of cousin Justina, made of bitterness and impliedness. As she lived in the house, she explained that she did not neglect the owner and shut up her resentments, or only said evil of God and the devil.</p><p>If I had my mother's resentments, there was no more reason to dislike Capitú, nor did she need further reasons. The intimacy of Capitú, however, had borne the most annoyance to my kinswoman. If at first he did not treat her badly, in time he changed his ways and eventually fled. Capitú, attenta, since he had not seen her, he inquired of her and went to her. Prima Justina tolerated this care. Life is full of obligations that we fulfill, however much it may have to infringe them bluntly. In addition, Capitú used certain magic that captiva; Cousin Justina would smile, though sour, but alone with my mother she thought of some bad word to say about the girl.</p><p>As my mother was sick of a fever, which put her at the gates of death, she wished that she might serve as a nurse. Prima Justina, though it relieved her of painful care, did not pardon my friend for intervention. One day he asked her if she did not have to do it at home; The other day, laughing, he gave her this epigram: "You do not have to run so much; he who has to be his hands must go. "</p><h2>LXVII - A Sin</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the way, I do not take the sick from the bed without mentioning what happened to me. After five days, my mother was so upset that she ordered me to go to the seminary. In vain Uncle Cosme:</p><p>-May Gloria, you're scared for no reason, the fever goes on ...</p><p>-No! no! Send him to him! I may die, and my soul is not saved, if Bentinho is not at my side.</p><p>-Let's scare him.</p><p>"Well, do not tell him anything, but go look for him, already, do not delay.</p><p>They took care to be delirious; but, costing nothing to bring me, Jose Dias was entrusted with the message. He came in so stunned that it startled me. He told the rector in particular what was there, and I was granted leave to go home. In the street, we were silent, he did not change the pace of custom, -the premise before the consequence, the consequence before the conclusion, -but with his head down and sighing, I was afraid to read in his face some hard and definitive news. He had only spoken to me in sickness, as a simple business; but the call, the silence, the sighs could say something else. My heart was beating hard, my legs were wobbling, more than once I kept falling ...</p><p>The yearning to hear the truth was complicated in me with the fear of knowing. It was the first time that death had appeared to me so close, it enveloped me, it faced me with pierced dark eyes. The more I walked that Barbonos street, the more terrified I was to get home, to enter, to hear the tears, to see a dead body ... Oh! I could never expose here everything I felt in those terrible minutes. The street, no matter how Jose Dias walked superlatively slowly, seemed to run away under my feet, houses fluttered from one side to the other, and a horn that on that occasion touched the barracks of the Permanent Municipalities resounded in my ears like the trumpet of judgment Last.</p><p>I went, arrived at Arcos, I entered the street of Matacavallos. The house was not soon there, but far beyond that of the Invalides, near the Senate. Trez or four times, I might ask my companion, without daring to open my mouth; but now he had no such desire. I was just walking, accepting the worst, as a gesture of destiny, as a necessity of the human work, and it was then that the Hope, to fight the Terror, secreted to my heart, not these words, for nothing articulated like words, but an idea that could be translated by them: "Mama defunct, the seminary ends."</p><p>Reader, it was lightning. So quickly did it lighten the night, as it faded, and the darkness became more closed, by the effect of the remorse that remained to me. It was a suggestion of lust and selfishness. Affirmative piety fainted a moment, with the prospect of certain freedom, by the disappearance of the debt and the debtor; It was for an instant, less than an instant, the hundredth of an instant, still enough to complicate my affliction with remorse.</p><p>José Dias sighed. Once he looked at me so full of pity that he seemed to have guessed me, and I wanted to ask him not to tell anyone, to punish me, and so on. But the pain brought so much love that it could not be taken from my sin; but then it was always my mother's death ... I felt a great anguish, a lump in my throat, and I could not, I cried at once.</p><p>-What is it, Bentinho?</p><p>-Mom...?</p><p>-No! no! What is this idea? The state of it is gravissimo, but it is not evil of death, and God could do everything. Wipe your eyes, it's ugly a good guy of your own to walk crying in the street. It has to be nothing, a fever ... The fevers, just as they give with force so also they leave ... With the fingers, no; Where is the handkerchief?</p><p>I wiped my eyes, though of all the words of Jose Dias one would remain in my heart; it was that very gravissimo. I saw afterwards that he only meant serious, but the use of the superlative makes the long mouth, and for the sake of the period, Jose Dias made my sadness grow. If you find in this book a case of the same family, let me know, reader, to amend it in the second edition; nothing is more ugly than giving long legs to brief ideas. I wiped my eyes, I repeat, and walked, anxious now to get home, and ask my mother for forgiveness of the bad thought I had. At last we came, we went in, I ascended the six steps of the stairs, and from there, leaning on the bed, I heard the tender words of my mother, who clasped my hands very tightly, calling me her son. It was burning, my eyes were burning in mine, all of it seemed consumed by an internal volcano. I knelt at the foot of the bed, but as it was tall, I stayed away from his caresses:</p><p>"No, my son, get up, get up!"</p><p>Capitú, who was in the alcove, liked to see my entrance, my gestures, words and tears, he told me later; but he did not naturally suspect all the causes of my affliction. Entering my room, I thought to tell my mother everything as soon as she was well, but this idea did not bite me, it was a pure velleity, an action I would never do, however much the sin would hurt me. Then, taken from remorse, I once again used my old way of spiritual promises, and asked God to forgive me and save my mother's life, and I would pray to him a thousand of our priests. Father you read me, forgive this resource; It was the last time I used it. The crisis in which I found myself, no less than custom and faith, explains everything. It was two thousand more; where were the ancients? I have not paid one or the other, but out of candida souls and true promises are like the fiduciary currency, - even if the debtor does not pay them, they are worth the money they say.</p><h2>LXVIII - Let's Put Off Virtue</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Few would have had the courage to confess that I thought of the street of Matacavallos. I will confess everything that matters to my story. Montaigne wrote of himself: ce ne sont pas mes gestes que j'ecris; c'est moi, c'est mon essence. Now, there is only one way of writing one's own essence, it is contal-all, good and evil. I do so, as I remember it, by commending myself to the construction or reconstruction of myself. For example, now that I have counted a peccadillo, I would say with great pleasure some beautiful contemporary action, if I remembered it, but it does not remind me; the best opportunity is transferred.</p><p>You will not lose hope, my friend; On the contrary, I now recall that ... Not only are beautiful actions beautiful at any time, but they are also possible and probable, because of the theory I have of sin and virtue, no less simple than clear. It is reduced to this that each person is born with a certain number of them, allied by marriage to compensate in life. When one of these marriages is stronger than the other, he alone guides the individual, without this, because he has not practiced such virtue or commited such peccadillo, can be said exempt of one or the other; but the rule is to give themselves the simultaneous practice of the two, to the advantage of the bearer of both, and sometimes with greater brilliance of the earth and the sky. It is unfortunate that I can not substantiate this with one or more strange cases; I lack time.</p><p>As far as I'm concerned, it's true that I was born with some of those houses, and of course I still have them. It has already happened to me, here in Engenho Novo, to be a night with a lot of headache, to wish that the Central train burst out of my ears and interrupt the line for many hours, even if someone died; and the next day I missed the train on the same road, because I went to give my cane to a blind man who did not carry a staff. Voilà mes gestes, voilà mon essence.</p><h2>LXIX - The Mass</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>One of the gestures that best express my essence was the devotion with which I ran on Sunday to hear Mass in St. Anthony of the Poor. The guest wanted to go with me, and he began to dress, but he was so slow in the braces and the loops that I could not wait for him. Besides, I wanted to be alone. I felt the need to avoid any conversation that would divert my thinking from the end I was going to, and it was to reconcile myself to God, after what happened in chapter LXVII. Nor was it only to ask him forgiveness of sin, he was also grateful for the restoration of my mother, and, since I say everything, make him renounce the payment of my promise. Yahweh, though divine, or even more so, is a much more humane Rothschild, and does not make moratoria, forgive the debts in full, once the debtor wants to mend life and cut off the expenses. Why, I wanted nothing else; dalli in deante would not make any more promises than he could pay, and he would pay them soon. </p><p>I heard Mass; in raising God, I thanked the life and health of my mother; then I asked for forgiveness of the sin and relief of the debt, and I received the final blessing of the officiant as a solemn act of reconciliation. In the end, he reminded me that the church established in the confessionary a secure registry, and in the most authentic confession of the instruments for the adjustment of moral accounts between man and God. But my incorrigible shyness closed that door for me; I feared I could find no words to tell the confessor my secret. How the man changes! Today I get to publish it. </p><h2>LXX - After Mass</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I prayed again, crossed myself, closed the book of Mass, and walked to the door. We hand was a lot, but the church is not big, and I could not leave soon, but slowly. There were men and women, old and young, silks and cheetahs, and probably ugly and beautiful eyes, but I did not see either one or the other. He was walking toward the door, the wave, listening to greetings and whispers. In the churchyard, where it became clear, I stopped and looked at all. Then I saw a girl and a man coming out of the church and stopped; and the girl would look at me talking to the man, and the man would look at me, listening to the girl. And these words came to me: </p><p>-What do you want? </p><p>-I wanted to know about her; Daddy ask. </p><p>It was Sancha, Sancho's companion at Capitú's college, who wanted news from my mother. The father came to me; I told her I was reinstated. Then we went out, showed me his house, and as I came in the same direction, we came together. Gurgel was a man of forty or so, with a tendency to thicken his belly; was very obsequious; arriving at the door of the house, forcing me to go and have lunch with him. </p><p>-Thank you; Mommy is waiting for me. </p><p>"Tell him to tell you that you're having lunch, and you'll come later." </p><p>-I came another day. </p><h2>LXXI - Escobar's Visit</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>At home, they had already lied telling my mother that I had come back and was changing clothes.</p><p>"The mass of eight ought to be finished ... Bentinho should be back ... Would something have happened, my dear Cosme? ... Send me a look ..." So she spoke, from minute to minute, but I went in. and with me the tranquility.</p><p>It was the day of good feelings. Escobar went to see me and know about my mother's health. He had never visited me there, nor had our relations been so close, as they came to be; but knowing the reason for my departure, three days before, took advantage of Sunday to go with me and ask if the danger was continuing or not. When I said no, he breathed.</p><p>"I was afraid," he said.</p><p>"Did the others know?"</p><p>"It seems so: some have.</p><p>Uncle Cosme and Jose Dias liked the young man; the guest told him that he had seen his father once in Rio de Janeiro. Escobar was very polished; and though he spake more than he came to speak after, yet he was not so much as the young men of our age; on that day I found it a little more expansive than usual. Uncle Cosimo wanted to have dinner with us. Escobar thought for a moment, and ended by saying that the pae's correspondent was waiting for him. I, remembering the words of Gurgel, repeated them:</p><p>"Let the black man say that you have dinner here, and then you will."</p><p>- Such trouble!</p><p>"No trouble at all," said Uncle Cosme.</p><p>Escobar accepted and dined. I noticed that the rapid movements he had and mastered in class also dominated them now, in the room as well as at the table. The time he spent with me was one of frank friendship. I showed him the few books he had. He liked the portrait of my father very much; after a few moments of contemplation, turned and said to me:</p><p>"You see, it was a pure heart!"</p><p>Escobar's eyes, clear as I said, were sweet; so José Dias defined them, after he left, and I keep this word, despite the forty years he has brought upon himself. In this there was no exaggeration of the aggregate. Her shaven face was smooth and smooth. The forehead was a little low, the scrape of hair almost above the left eyebrow; but always had the necessary height not to displease the other features, nor to diminish their grace. Really, it was interesting on the face, the thin, bumpy mouth, the curved, slender nose. The priest had the right to shake off his right shoulder from time to time, and he had lost it, since one of us noticed him one day in the seminary; The first example I saw was that a man was able to correct himself very well about minor defects.</p><p>I never ceased to feel such and such a fading that my friends would please all. At home, they loved Escobar; the same cousin Justina thought she was a very appreciable young man, despite ... Although what? asked Jose Dias, seeing that she did not finish the phrase. There was no answer, no phone call; cousin Justina probably did not see any clear or important defect in our host; though it was a sort of resave for some who would discover it one day; or it was a work of old use, which led her to restrain, where she found no restriction.</p><p>Escobar said goodbye right after dinner; I went to the door, where we waited for an omnibus. He told me that the correspondent's storeroom was on Pescadores Street, and it was open until nine o'clock: he did not want to be late. We parted with great affection: he, from within the bus, still said goodbye with his hand. I kept myself at the door, to see if in the distance I would still look back, but did not look.</p><p>"What friend is that size?" asked someone from a window by the foot.</p><p>Needless to say, it was Capitú. These are things that are divined in life, as in books, whether they are novels or true stories. It was Capitú, who had been looking at us for some time, inside the Venetian, and now he had opened the window entirely, and it had appeared. He saw our farewells so torn and affectionate, and wondered who it was I deserved so much.</p><p>"It's Escobar," I said, going to put myself under the window, looking up.</p><h2>LXXII - A Dramatic Change</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Neither I nor you nor she nor anyone else in this story could answer more, so surely, fate, like all playwrights, does not announce the adventures or the outcome. They arrive at their own time, until the cloth falls, the lights go out, and the spectators go to sleep. In this genre is there anything to reform, and I would propose, as an essay, that the pieces begin at the end. Othello would kill himself and Desdemona in the first act, the next three would be given to the slow and decreasing action of jealousy, and the latter would be left alone with the early scenes of the threat of the Turks, the explanations of Othello and Desdemona, and the good advice of In this way, the spectator, on the one hand, would find in the theater the usual charade that the newspapers give him, because the last acts would explain the outcome of the first, a kind of concept, and, on the other hand side, went to bed with a good impression of tenderness and love: </p><p>She loved what had afflicted me, </p><p>I loved her pity. </p><h2>LXXIII - The Rule</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Destiny is not only a playwright, it is also its own counter-rule, that is, it assigns the characters entry to the scene, gives them the letters and other objects, and performs within the corresponding signaes the dialog, a thunderstorm, a car , a shot. When I was young, it was represented there, in I do not know what theatro, a drama that ended in the final judgment. The main character was Ashaverus, who in the last frame concluded a monologue by this exclamation: "I hear the trumpet of the archanjo!" There was no trumpet. Ashaverus, ashamed, repeated the word, now louder, to warn the counter-rule, but still nothing. Then he walked to the bottom, disguisedly tragic, but effectively to speak to the frame, and say in a low voice: "The piston! the piston! the piston! "The audience heard this word and burst out laughing until, when the trumpet sounded devas, and Ashaverus cried for the third time that it was the archanjo's, a gaiato of the plateau corrected below:" No, sir, it is the piston of the archanjo! »</p><p>That explains my stay under the window of Capitú and the passage of a cavalleiro, a dandy, as we said then. He wore a beautiful chestnut horse, fastened on the seam, he wrapped it in his left hand, his right hand strap, his patent leather boots, his lean figure and posture: his face was not unknown to me. They had passed others, and still others would come after; everyone went to their girlfriends. It was time use to date horse. Relen Alencar: "Because a student (said one of his characters in the theater of 1858) could not be without these two things, a cavallo and a girlfriend." Relê Alvares de Azevedo. One of his poems is intended to tell (1851) that he resided in Catumby, and, to see his girlfriend on the Cattete, hired a horse for three thousand kings ... Thirteen thousand kings! all is lost in the night of time!</p><p>Now the dandy of the bay horse did not pass like the others; was the trumpet of final judgment and sounded in time; so does Destiny, which is its own counter-rule. The gentleman was not content to walk, but he turned his head to our side, the side of Capitú, and looked at Capitú, and Capitú for him; the cavallo walked, the man's head was letting go back. Such was the second tooth of jealousy that bit me. In fact, it was natural to admire the beautiful figures; but that fellow used to pay there in the afternoons; lived in the old Field of the Acclamation, and then ... and then ... Go there reason with a heart of breasts, as was mine!</p><p>He did not say anything to Capitú; I left the street in a hurry, I went down my corridor, and when I found myself, I was in the parlor.</p><h2>LXXIV - The Clasp</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the parlor, Uncle Cosme and Jose Dias were talking, one sitting, the other walking and stopping. The sight of Jose Dias reminded me of what he had said to me in the seminary: "Aquillo, as long as you do not get some mountain range that marries her ...." It was certainly allusion to the knight. This memory aggravated my impression of the street; but would not that word, unconsciously guarded, give me credit for the malice of their eyes? The desire I had was to take Jose Dias by the collar, take him to the hall and ask him if he had spoken of truth or by hypothese; but Jose Dias, who stops when he sees me enter, continued to walk and to speak. I impatiently wanted to go to the house on foot, I imagined that Capitú would leave the frightened window and soon appear and inquire and explain .... And the two spoke until Uncle Cosme rose to go and see the sick, and Jose Dias came to see me, to the window of the other window. </p><p>For a moment I had the desire to ask him what was between Capitú and the peaks of the neighborhood; now, imagining that he was coming just to tell me, I was afraid to hear him. Maybe it will cover his mouth. Jose Dias saw in my face some signal different from the usual expression, and asked me with interest: </p><p>-What is it, Bentinho? </p><p>So as not to fital it, I dropped my eyes. The eyes, falling down, saw that one of the loops of the man's trousers was unbuttoned, and as he insisted on knowing what I had, I replied with a pointed finger: </p><p>-Look at the clip, button the clip. </p><p>Jose Dias leaned over, and I ran away. </p><h2>LXXV - The Despair</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I escaped the escaped, escaped my mother not going to the room, but I did not escape myself. I ran to my room, and entered behind me. I would talk, I would chase after me, I would throw myself into bed, and roll with me, and weep, and drown the sobs with the end of the sheet. I vowed not to go to see Capitú that afternoon, and never again, and to become a priest at once. I had already seen that I would cry of repentance and ask forgiveness, but I, cold and serene, would have nothing but contempt and contempt; he turned his back on her. She called him wicked. Twice I found myself biting my teeth, as if I had it between them. </p><p>From the bed I could hear the voice of her, who had come to spend the rest of the afternoon with my mother, and of course with me, as of other times; but no matter how great the shock he gave me, he did not make me leave the room. Capitú laughed loudly, he spoke loudly, as if he were telling me; I was still deaf, alone with myself and with contempt. The desire it gave me was to nail her nails to her neck, to enter them well, until she saw her life come out with her blood .... </p><h2>LXXVI - Explanation</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>At the end of time, he was satisfied, but downcast. As I found myself stretched out on the bed with my eyes on the ceiling, he reminded me of my mother's recommendation that I should not lie down after dinner to avoid any congestion. I got up suddenly, but did not leave the room. Capitú now laughed less and spoke lower; I would be afflicted with my seclusion, but it did not shake me. </p><p>I did not sleep and slept badly. The next morning was no better, it was different. My pain was now complicated by the fear of having gone beyond what was appropriate, failing to examine the business. Since my head ached a little, I simulated more trouble, in order not to go to the seminary and speak to Capitú. She could be angry with me, she might not want me now and prefer the gentleman. To solve everything, listen to it and judge it; it could be defense and explanation. </p><p>He had both. When he learned the cause of my seclusion from the evening, he told me that it was a great injury to him; she could not believe that after our exchange of oaths, so thoughtless she thought she could believe .... And here tears broke her, and she made a gesture of separation; but I came quickly, I took her hands and kissed them with such soul and warmth that I felt them tremble. I wiped my eyes with my fingers, I kissed them again, for them and for the tears; then he sighed, then shook his head. He confessed to me that he did not know the boy, except the others who passed by in the afternoons, on horseback or on foot. If she had looked at him, it was proof that there was nothing between them; if there was one, it was natural to dissemble. </p><p>"And what could there be, if he's going to get married?" he concluded. </p><p>Is going to marry? </p><p>He was going to get married, he told me with whom, with a girl from the Barbonos street. This reason framed me more than anything, and she felt it in my gesture; nor did he fail to say that, in order to avoid a new mistake, he would no longer go to the window. </p><p>-No! no! no! I do not ask you this! </p><p>He consented to withdraw the promise, but made another, and it was at my first suspicion that everything would be dissolved between us. I accepted the threat, and swore I would never do it: it was the first suspicion and the last. </p><h2>LXXVII - Pleasure of Old Pains</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Counting that crisis of my adolescent love, I feel something that I do not know if I explain well, and is that the pains of that court, to such an extent they have been spiritualized with time, that they are even diluted in pleasure. This is not clear, but not everything is clear in life or in books. The truth is that I have a particular liking to refer to such annoyance, when it is true that he reminds me of others whom I would not remember for anything.</p><h2>LXXVIII - Secrecy for Secrets</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Besides, at the same time I felt the need to tell someone what was going on between me and Capitú. I did not mention everything, but only a part, and it was Escobar who received it. When I returned to the seminary on Wednesday, I found him uneasy; He told me that it was his intention to go and see me if I delayed another day at home. I wondered with interest what I had, and whether everything was good.</p><p>-I am.</p><p>He listened, stinging my eyes. Three days later he said that they were finding me very distracted; it was good to disguise as much as he could. Elle, on his part, had reason to be distracted too, but he sought to be attentive.</p><p>"Then it seems to you ....?"</p><p>"Yes, sometimes you do not hear anything, looking honestly; disguise, Santiago.</p><p>-I have reasons ....</p><p>-Creio; no one is distracted by anything</p><p>-Escobar ....</p><p>I hesitated; he waited.</p><p>-What is?</p><p>"Escobar, you're my friend, I'm your friend too; here in the seminary you are the person who has most entered my heart, and there I went, except the family, I do not have a friend.</p><p>"If I say the same thing," he replied, smiling, "he loses his grace; It seems like I'm repeating. But the truth is that I do not have relations with anyone here, you are the first and I think you have noticed; but I do not care about that.</p><p>Moved, I felt the voice rush through my throat.</p><p>"Shrink, can you keep a secret?"</p><p>-You ask is because you doubt, and in this case ....</p><p>Sorry, it's a way of speaking. I know he's a serious young man, and I pretend to confess to a priest.</p><p>"If you need absolution, you're acquitted."</p><p>"Shrink, I can not be a priest." I am here, my people believe, they expect it; but I can not be a priest.</p><p>-Not me, Santiago.</p><p>-Neither you?</p><p>"Keep it a secret; I also have the purpose of not finishing the course; my desire is commerce, but do not say anything, absolutely nothing; It's just between us. And it is not that I am not religious; I am religious, but commerce is my passion.</p><p>-Only that?</p><p>"What else is it?"</p><p>I made two rounds and whispered the first word of my confession, so scarce and deaf, that I did not hear it myself; I know, however, that I said "a person ..." with reticence. A person....? It did not take more for him to understand. A person must be a girl. Do not even think you're astonished to see me boyfriend; he thought it was natural and he stuck his eyes at me again. Then I told him what I could, but not long enough to have the pleasure of repeating it. Escobar listened with interest; at the end of our conversation, he declared to me that it was a secret buried in a cemetery. He advised me not to become a priest. He could not take to the church a heart that was not of heaven, but of earth; he would be a bad priest, nor a priest. Instead. God protected the sincere; since I could only serve him in the world, I had to stay there.</p><p>You do not calculate the pleasure you gave me the confidence I gave you. It was like more happiness. That young heart that listened to me and was right, brought an extraordinary aspect to this world. It was a great and beautiful world, life an excellent career, and I was no more nor less a mimoso of the sky; here is my feeling. Note that I did not tell you everything, not the best; I did not mention the chapter of the hairstyle, for example, nor others like that; but the count was too much.</p><p>That we have returned to the subject, it is not necessary to say it. We came back one and many times; I praised the moral qualities of Capitú, an adequate subject to the admiration of a seminarian, simplicity, modesty, love of work and religious customs. I did not touch his physical graces, nor did he ask me about them; I merely insinuated the convenience of knowing it by sight.</p><p>"It's not possible now," I told him the first week after returning home; Capitú is going to spend a few days with a friend from the street of the Invalids. When she comes, you will go there; but he was able to go before; Why was not dinner with me?</p><p>-You did not invite me.</p><p>"Why do you need to invite?" Everyone at home was very fond of you.</p><p>"I like everyone, too, but if it's possible to make a distinction, I confess that your mother is a lovely lady.</p><p>-Is not true? retorqui full of uproar.</p><h2>LXXIX - Let's Go to the Chapter</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>As a matter of fact, I enjoyed hearing you speak like that. You know my opinion of my mother. Even now, after interrupting this line to look at the portrait that hangs on the wall, I think it had on the printed face that quality. Nor is it otherwise to explain Escobar's opinion that he had only exchanged four words with her. One alone was enough to penetrate her inner essence; Yes, yes, my mother was lovely. As much as she was forcing me into a career that I did not want, I could not help but feel that she was lovely, like a saint. </p><p>And was it certain that he obligated me to an ecclesiastical career? Here I reach a point, which I hoped would come later, so much that I already wondered at what height it would give him a chapter. Actually, it was not possible to say now what only later I presumed to discover; but once I touched the spot, it's best to end it. It is serious and complex, delicate and subtle, one of those in which the author must attest to the son, and the son must listen to the author, so that both tell the truth, only the truth, but the whole truth. It should also be noted that this point is what makes the saint most adorable, without prejudice (on the contrary!) Of the human and terrestrial part that was in her. Enough of preface to the chapter; Let's go to the chapter. </p><h2>LXXX - On to the Story</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Let's go to the chapter. My mother was God-fearing; you know this, and their religious practices, and the pure faith that animated them. Nor do you not know that my ecclesiastical career was the object of promise made when I was conceived. Everything is told opportunely. Otherwise, you know that for the purpose of tightening the moral bond of obligation, he entrusted his plans and motives to relatives and relatives. The promise, made with fervor, received with mercy, was kept by her, with joy, in the inmost heart. I think I felt the taste of happiness in the milk that gave me to suckle. My father, if he lived, it is possible that he would change his plans, and as he had the vocation of politics, it is probable that he would refer me only to politics, even though the two offices were neither irreconcilable, and more than one priest parties and in the government of men. But my father died without knowing anything, and she stayed behind the contract, as sole debtor.</p><p>One of Franklin's aphorisms is that for those who have to pay in Paschoa, Lent is short. Our Lent was not longer than the others, and my mother, after sending me to teach Latin and doctrine, began to postpone my entrance into the seminary. This is what is called, commercially speaking, to reform a letter. The creditor was archimonary, he did not depend on that amount to eat, and he consented to the payment transfers, without even aggravating the interest rate. One day, however, one of the relatives who served as endorsers of the letter, spoke of the need to deliver the adjusted price; is in one of the first chapters. My mother agreed and I went to St. Joseph's.</p><p>Now, in this same chapter, she poured some tears, which she wiped without explaining, and that none of those present, neither Uncle Cosme, Bad cousin Justina, nor the whole José Dias understood absolutely; I, who was behind the door, understood no more than they. Well examined, in spite of the distance, one sees that they were previous homesicknesses, the sorrow of separation, -and might be also (it is the beginning of the point), it could be that repentance of the promise. Catholica and devout, she felt very well that the promises are fulfilled; the question is whether it is timely and appropriate to do them all, and naturally inclined to refuse. Why would God punish her by denying her a second child? The divine will could be my life, without the need to dedicate it to him. It was a late reason; it should have been done on the day I was raised. In any case, it was a first conclusion; but, not enough to complete to destroy, everything remained, and I went to the seminary.</p><p>A nap of faith would have solved the matter in my favor, but faith was watching with its large naive eyes. My mother would, if she could, exchange a promise, giving part of her years to keep me, from the clergy, married and father; is what I assume, just as I suppose that he rejected that idea, because it seems disloyal to him. So I always felt it in the current of ordinary life.</p><p>It happened that my absence was soon tempered by the assiduity of Capitú. This began to be necessary for her. Little by little he was persuaded that the little girl would make me happy. Then (it is the end of the annunciated point), the hope that our love, making me absolutely incompatible with the seminary, would lead me not to stay there neither by God nor by the devil, this intimate and secret hope came to invade the heart of my mother. In this case, I would break the contract without her being at fault. Ella would stay with me without her own act. It was as if, having entrusted to someone the importance of a debt to take it to the creditor, the bearer kept the money with him and took nothing. In common life, the act of third party does not relieve the contractante; but the advantage of contracting with the sky is that intention is worth money.</p><p>You must have had conflicts similar to this, and if you are religious you will have sought to reconcile heaven and earth in an identical or similar way. The sky and the earth end up being reconciled; They are quasi twin brothers, with the heaven being made on the second day and the earth on the third. Like Abraham, my mother took her son to the Mount of Sight, and the wood for the burnt offering, the fire, and the cutello. And he bound Isaac on the beam of wood, and took hold of the cutello, and lifted him up. When he causes him to fall, he hears the voice of the angel who commands him from the Lord: "Do not harm your son; I knew that you fear God. "Such would be my mother's secret hope.</p><p>Capitú was naturally the angel of the Scripture. The truth is that my mother could not tel her now far from her. The growing affinity was manifest by extraordinary acts. Capitú became the flower of the house, the morning sun, the coolness of the afternoons, the moon of the nights; He lived there for hours and hours, listening, speaking and singing. My mother touched his heart, rolled his eyes, and my name was between them as the password of the future life.</p><h2>LXXXI - A Word</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>So told what I discovered later, I can translate here a word from my mother. Now it will be understood that she told me, on the first sabbath, when I got home, and I knew that Capitú was in the street of the Invalides, with Little Miss Gurgel.</p><p>"Why do not you go?" Did not you tell me that Sancha's mother offered you the house?</p><p>-Offered.</p><p>-So? But it's if you want. Capitú should have returned today to finish a job with me; her friend was certainly asked to sleep there.</p><p>"Maybe they were dating," cousin Justina hinted.</p><p>I did not kill her because I did not have my hand iron or rope, pistol or dagger; but the eyes I laid on him, if they could kill, would have suppressed everything. One of Providence's mistakes was to leave to man only his arms and teeth as weapons of attack, and his legs as weapons of escape or defense. The eyes were enough for the first effect. A movement of them would make an enemy or a rival fall or fall, they would carry out revenge, with this accoutrement, that in order to bewilder justice, the same murderous eyes would be pious eyes, and would run to weep the victim. Prima Justina escaped mine; I did not escape the point of insinuation, and on Sunday, at eleven o'clock, I ran to the street of the Invalides.</p><p>Sancha's father received me in disarray and sad. The daughter was ill; he had fallen in the evening with a fever that was aggravating. As he loved his daughter very much, he thought he was already dead, and he announced that he would kill himself too. Here is a funeral chapter like a cemetery, deaths, suicides and murders. I craved a light beam of light and blue sky. It was Capitú who brought them to the door of the room, coming to tell his mother that his daughter had sent for him.</p><p>"Is it worse?" asked Gurgel, startled.</p><p>"No, sir, but you want to talk to him."</p><p>"Stay here a little," he told her; and turning to me: She is Sancha's nurse, who wants no other; I'll be right back.</p><p>Capitú carried signs of fatigue and commotion, but he saw me so quickly, every other girl remained, the young girl of always, fresh and lepida, no less than astonished. It cost him to believe it was me. He spoke to me, perhaps speaking, and we spoke for a few minutes, but so low and so muffled that even the walls did not hear, they who have ears. Besides, if they heard anything, they understood nothing, neither they nor the furniture, which were as sad as the owner.</p><h2>LXXXII - The Couch</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Delles, only the couch seemed to have understood our moral situation, since he offered us the services of his straw, with such insistence that we acceded and sat down. Date is the private opinion I have of the couch. Elle makes intimacy and decorum, and shows the whole house without leaving the room. Two men sitting on it could debate the fate of an empire, and two women the grace of a dress; but a man and a woman only by aberration of the natural laws will say another thing that is not of themselves. That's what we did, Capitú and me. Vaguely reminds me that I asked him if the delay there would be great ... </p><p>-Do not know; the fever seems to give way ... but ... </p><p>It also reminds me, vaguely, that I explained my visit to the street of the Invalides, in the truth, that is, on my mother's advice. </p><p>-Advise her? muttered Capitú. </p><p>And he raised his eyes, which shone exceedingly: </p><p>-We will be happy! </p><p>I repeated these words with the simple fingers, pressing the words. The couch, whether he saw it or not, continued to render his services to our imprisoned hands and to our heads together or almost together. </p><h2>LXXXIII - The Portrait</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Gurgel returned to the room and told Capitú that his daughter was calling for her. I got up quickly and found no composure; He squinted through the chairs. On the contrary, Capitú arose naturally and asked him if the fever had increased. </p><p>"No," he said. </p><p>Neither startled nor anything, no air of mystery on the part of Capitú; He turned to me, and told me to take my mother and cousin Justina with her, and see you soon; He reached out and ran down the hall. All my jealousy was with her. How could it be that Capitú governed so easily and I did not? "There's a girl," Gurgel said, looking at her. </p><p>I murmured that yes. In fact, Capitú was growing in his careers, the forms rounded and invigorated with great intensity; morally, the same thing. She was a woman inside and out, woman on the right and left, woman on all sides, and from the feet to the head. It was more rushed, now that I saw it from day to day; every time she came home she found her taller and fuller; the eyes seemed to have another reflection, and the mouth another empire. Gurgel, turning to the wall of the room where a portrait of a girl hung, asked me if Capitú was similar to the portrait. </p><p>One of the customs of my life was always to agree with the probable opinion of my interlocutor, since matter did not aggravate, annoy or impose me. Before examining whether Capitú was indeed similar to the portrait, I replied that I did. Then he said it was the portrait of the woman, and that the people who knew her said the same thing. He also thought that his features were similar, his forehead was mainly his eyes. As for genius, it was one; they looked like sisters. "Finally, even her friendship with Sanchinha; her mother was no longer her friend ... In life there are such exquisite similarities. </p><h2>LXXXIV - Called</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the hall and in the street, I examined myself, if indeed he would have suspected something, but I thought he would not, and made me walk. I was satisfied with the visit, with the joy of Capitú, with the praises of Gurgel, to the point that I did not immediately come to a voice that called me:</p><p>-Sr. Bentinho! Mr. Bentinho!</p><p>Only after the voice had grown and the owner of it arrived at the door did I stop and see what it was and where it was. It was already in the street of Matacavallos. The house was a crockery, scarce and poor; the doors were half-closed, and the person who called me was a poor gray-haired, poorly dressed man.</p><p>-Sr. Bentinho, she said to me crying; Do you know that my son Manduca died?</p><p>-Died?</p><p>"He's been dead for half an hour, buried tomorrow." I sent word to your mother right now, and she did me the charity of sending some flowers to put in the coffin. My poor son! He had to die, and it was good for him to die, poor thing, but in spite of everything, it always hurts. What a life he had! One day he still remembered you, and asked if he was in the seminary ... Do you want it? Come in, come on-o ...</p><p>It costs me to say this, but rather small by excessive than by diminutive. To answer that no, I did not want to see Manduca, and even made a gesture to escape. It was not fear; On another occasion it could be until I entered with ease and curiosity, but now I was so happy! See a deceased when he returns from a girlfriend ... There are things that do not fit or match. The simple news was already a big haze. My golden ideas lost all color and metal to change into dark gray and ugly, and I can not distinguish anything else. I think I said I was in a hurry, but I probably did not speak in clear words, not even human, because he, leaning against the door, made room for me with the gesture, and I, with no soul to enter or to flee, what he could, and the body entered.</p><p>I do not blame the man; for him, the most important thing at the time was his son. But do not blame me either; for me, the most important thing was Capitú. The bad thing was that the two cases came together the same afternoon, and that the death of one came to nose into the life of the other. This is all evil. If I passed before or after, or if Manduca waited a few hours to die, no annoying note would interrupt the melodies of my soul. Why die exactly half an hour ago? Every hour is appropriate to the object; dies very well at six or seven in the afternoon.</p><h2>LXXXV - The Deceased</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Such was the confused feeling I entered into the china shop. The store was dark, and the interior of the house had less light, now that the windows of the area were closed. At one corner of the dining room I saw her mother crying; At the door of the alcove two children stared in amazement, their finger in the mouth. The corpse was lying on the bed; the bed...</p><p>Let us suspend the penna and go to janella to lighten the memory. Actually, the painting was ugly, already by death, already by the deceased, which was horrible ... This here, yes, is another thing. Everything I see there breathes life, the goat that ruminates at the foot of a wagon, the chicken that feeds on the floor of the street, the train of the Central Road that snorts, whistles, smokes and passes, the palm that invests for the sky, and finally that church tower, although it has no muscles or foliage. A young man, who stands there in a bag, throws a paper kite, does not die or die, even if he calls himself Manduca.</p><p>True, the other Manduca was older than this, little older. It would have been eighteen or nineteen years, but you would give it fifteen to twenty-two years, your face would not allow you to bring the truth into view, but would hide it in the folds of ... Go, tell yourself everything; is dead, his kinsmen are dead, if any is not in such evidence that is vexe or dôa. Tell yourself everything; Manduca suffered from a cruel illness, no less than leprosy. Alive was ugly; dead man looked horrible to me. When I saw him lying on the bed, the sad body of my neighbor, I was terrified and I looked away. I do not know what occult hand compelled me to look again, even if I ran away; I gave in, looked, looked again, until I pulled back from everything and left the room.</p><p>"You've done much!" sighed the pae.</p><p> -Queuca of Manduca! her mother sobbed. <!--/ p--> </p><p>I took care of going out, said I was expected at home, and said goodbye. The father asked me if he would go to the funeral; I answered the truth, I did not know, I would do what my mother wanted. And quickly I left, went through the store, and jumped into the street.</p><h2>LXXXVI - Amai Boys!</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was so close that before three minutes I found myself at home. I stopped in the corridor, taking breath; he tried to forget the dead, pallid and deformed, and the more he did not say not to give these pages a disgusting look, but he imagined it. Everything cleared in a few seconds; it was enough for me to think about the other house, and more about Capitú's life and fresh, bearded face ... Love, boys! and, above all, love beautiful girls; they give remedy to evil, smell the infect, exchange death for life ... Love, boys! </p><h2>LXXXVII - The Sege</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I had reached the last step, and an idea entered my brain, as if waiting for me, between the bars of the cancella. I heard the words of Manduca's father asking me to go to the funeral the next day. I stopped on the step. I reflected for a moment; yes, I could go to the funeral, I would ask my mother to hire me a car ... Do not take it for granted that it was the desire to drive, no matter how keen to drive. As a child, he reminded me that I went to my mother with friends and for ceremonies, and it was raining at Mass. It was an old seige of my father, which she saved as much as she could. The coachman, who was our slave, as old as he was when he saw me, dressed, waiting for my mother, said to me with a laugh: -John is going to take nhonhô! And it was rare that I did not recommend him: -João, it takes the beasts very long; it goes slow "Gloria does not like it tomorrow." -But delay! It is understood that it was to savor the sege, not the vanity, because she did not allow to see the people that went inside. It was an old obsolete, two-wheeled, narrow and short section with two leather curtains in the front, which ran to the sides when it was necessary to enter or leave. Each curtain had a glass eye, which I liked to spy on. - Sit down, Bentinho! - Let me peek, Mom! And when he was younger, he would thrust his face into the glass, and saw the charioteer with his great boots, scattered on the mule on the left, and holding the net of the other; in his hand he carried the thick, long whip. All incommodo, the boots, the whip and the mules, but he liked it and so did I. On the other side of the street were the houses, shops or not, open or closed, with or without people, and on the street the people who came and went, or crossed before the seige, with big strides or small steps. When there was an impediment of people or animals, the sege stopped, and then the spectacle was particularly interesting; the people standing on the sidewalk or at the door of the houses, looking at the sege and talking to each other, naturally about who would go inside. When I grew up in age, I imagined they would guess and say: "It's that lady from the street of Matacavallos, who has a son, Bentinho ..." The sege went so much with the recondita life of my mother that when there was no other, we continued to walk in it, and was known in the street and in the neighborhood by the "old sege." After all, my mother consented to leave her, without selling it soon; only gave it up because the stagecoach forced her to do so. The reason for keeping it useless was exclusively sentimental; it was the memory of her husband. Everything that came from my father was preserved as a piece of him, a remnant of the person, the same integral and pure soul. But the use, this one was also carrancismo son that she confessed to the friendly. My mother expressed well the fidelity to old habits, old ways, old ideas, old fashions. She had her museum of relics, unused combs, a patch of headdress, copper coins dating from 1824 and 1825, and to make things old, she herself wanted to grow old; but I have already said that at this point I did not reach everything I wanted.</p><h2>LXXXVIII - An Honest Pretext</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>No, the idea of ​​going to the funeral did not come from the memory of the car and its sweetness. The origin was different: it was because, following the funeral the next day, he would not go to the seminary, and could make another visit to Capitú, a little more delayed. That's where it was. The memory of the car could come later, but the main and immediate one was that. He would return to the street of the Invalids, under the pretext of knowing of Szechy Gurgel. I counted on everything to leave me like that day, Gurgel afflicto, Capitú with me on the couch, my hands clasped, my hairstyle ... "I'm going to ask Mom." </p><p>I opened the cancella. Before I had transposed it, just as I had heard from the memory of the dead man's word, I now heard the mother's voice, and I repeated in a low voice, -Queuca of Manduca! </p><h2>LXXXIX - The Refusal</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>My mother was puzzled when I asked her to go to the funeral. </p><p>- Missing a day of seminary ... </p><p>I pointed out to him the friendship Manduca had for me, and then he was poor people ... All he reminded me to say, he said. Prima Justina opined in the negative. </p><p>"Do not you think you should go?" asked my mother. </p><p>-I think not. What friendship is this that I have never seen? </p><p>Prima Justina won. When I referred the case to the addressee, he smiled, and told me that his cousin's hidden motive was probably not to give burial "the chandelier of my person." Whatever it was, I was sulky; The next day, thinking about the reason, I did not dislike it; I found a particular flavor later on. </p><h2>XC - The Controversy</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The next day, I passed by the deceased's house, without going in or stopping, "or, if I stopped, it was only a moment, even shorter than the one in which I tell you. If I'm not mistaken, I walked faster, afraid that they would call me as I did in the evening. Since he was not going to the funeral, sooner rather than later. I walked and thought of the poor devil.</p><p>We were not friends, nor did we know each other very much. Intimacy, what intimacy could there be between delle disease and my health? We had brief and distant relationships. I thought of them, remembering some. They were all reduced to a controversy between us two years earlier, by the way ... You can hardly believe what it was for. It was the Crimson War.</p><p>Manduca lived in the interior of the house, lying in bed, reading in disgust. On Sunday, in the afternoon, the father would tuck a dark nightgown into him, and bring him to the back of the shop, where he watched a handful of the street and people passing by. It was all his recreation. It was there that I saw him once, and I was not astonished; his illness was eating some of the meat, his fingers wanted to squeeze; the look did not work, of course. I was from thirteen to fourteen years old. The second time I saw him there, as we talked about the Crimean war, which then burned and was in the papers, Manduca said that the allies would win, and I said no.</p><p>"Well, we'll see," he said. Only if justice does not win in this world, which is impossible, and justice is with allies.</p><p>"No, sir, the reason is the Russians.</p><p>Of course, we would go with what the city papers told us, transcribing what happened, but it might also be that each of us had the opinion of his temperament. I've always been a bit of a Muscovite in my ideas. I defended the law of Russia, Manduca did the same to the Allies, and the third Sunday I entered the store we touched on the subject again. Manduca proposed that we should change the argument by writing, and on Tuesday or Wednesday I received two sheets of paper containing the exposition and defense of the right of allies, and of the integrity of Turkey, concluding by this prophetical phrase:</p><p>"The Russians will not enter Constantinople!"</p><p>I read it and met the refutation. It does not remind me of one of the arguments I have used, nor perhaps an interest in knowing them, now that the century is about to expire; but the idea that remained of them was that they were irresponsible. I went to take my paper myself. They led me into the alcove, where he lay stretched out on the bed, barely covered by a patchwork quilt. Either I like the controversy or some other cause I do not reach, it did not let me feel all the disgust that came out of the bed and the sick, and the pleasure with which I gave the paper was sincere. Manduca, for her part, no matter how naughtily she had her face, the smile that brought her to conceal the physical evil. The conviction with which he received me the paper and said he would read and respond is that he has no words of ours or others that say it at all and with truth; she was not exalted, she was not noisy, she had no gestures, and no discomfort would allow them, she was simple, great, deep, an infinite pleasure of victory, before I knew my arguments. He already had paper, pen and ink at the foot of the bed. Days later I received the reply; I do not remember if I brought new things or not; the heat was growing, and the end was the same:</p><p>"The Russians will not enter Constantinople!"</p><p>I trembled, and for some time there continued a fiery polemic, in which none of us gave up, each defending his customers with strength and fury. Manduca was longer than I was. Naturally I had a thousand things that distracted me, study, recreation, family, and health, which called me to other exercises. Manduca, save the span of the street on Sunday afternoon, had only this war, an aspect of the city and the world, but that nobody would deal with him. Chance had given him an adversary; he, who had a liking for writing, sat down to the debate, as to a new and radical remedy. The sad, long hours were now brief and cheerful; his eyes fell from crying, if they wept before. I felt this change in him in the mother's own ways.</p><p>"You can not imagine how he is now, after you've written those papers to him," said the shop owner once at the front door. Talk and laugh a lot. As soon as I tell the clerk to take the papers from him, he goes in to inquire about the answer, and he will be very late, and ask the boy when he passes. While waiting, relays journals and takes notes. But he also just gets his papers, throws himself at them, and starts writing the answer. There are times when you do not eat or eat badly; so much that I wanted to ask you something, do not send them at lunch or dinner time ...</p><p>I canceled it first. I began to delay the answers, until I did not give any more; he still had two or three times after my silence, but he did not receive any objection, either because of fatigue or because he did not bother, he ended everything with his apologies. The last, like the first, like all, affirmed the same eternal prediction:</p><p>"The Russians will not enter Constantinople!"</p><p>They did not enter, effectively, then, or after, or until now. But will the prediction be eternal? Will not they ever come in? Difficult problem. The Manduca himself, to enter the grave, has spent three years of dissolution, so surely nature, like history, is not making fun of. His life resisted like Turkey; if at last he yielded, it was because he lacked an alliance like the Anglo-French, and such a simple agreement of medicine and pharmacy could not be considered. He died at last, how the States die; in our particular case, the question is whether Turkey will die, because death spares no one, but whether the Russians will ever enter Constantinople; this was the question for my leper's neighbor, under the sad, broken and infected patchwork quilt ...</p><h2>XCI - Find That Console</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Of course, the reflections that I leave behind were not made then, on the way to the seminary, but now in the Engenho Novo office. So I did not do any of it except this one: that I served as a relief to my little Manduca. Today, thinking better, I think I was not only helpful, but I even gave him happiness. And the find comforts me; now I shall not forget that I gave two or three months of happiness to a poor devil, making him forget the evil and the rest. It is some thing in the liquidation of my life. If there is in the other world such or such a prize for unintentional virtues, it will pay one or two of my many sins. As for the Manduca, I do not think it was a matter of opinion against Russia, but if he was, he would be purging forty years of happiness that he reached in two or three months, -which will conclude (already late) that it was even better to moan only, without saying anything. </p><h2>XCII - The Devil Is Not As Ugly As It Looks</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Manduca buried himself without me. To many others the same thing happened, without my feeling anything, but this case afflicted me particularly for the reason already said. I also felt I do not know how melancholy I remembered the first controversy of life, the taste with which he received my papers and intended to refute them, not counting the taste of the car ... But time quickly erased all these homesickness and resurrections . Nor was he alone; two people came to help him, Capitú, whose image he slept with me the same night, and another that I will say in the next chapter. The rest of this chapter is only to ask that if anyone has to read my book with any more attention than to demand the price of the copy, be sure to conclude that the devil is not as ugly as it is painted. I mean... I mean that my neighbor of Matacavallos, tempering the evil with the anti-Russian opinion, gave the rot of his flesh a spiritual reflection that comforted them. There are greater consolations, of course, and one of the most excellent is not to suffer this or any other evil, but nature is so divine that it amuses itself with such contrasts, and the most disgusting or more afflicts beckons with a flower. And perhaps it would leave the most beautiful flower; my gardener affirms that the violets, in order to have a superior odor, have no need of pig manure. I did not examine it, but it must be true. </p><h2>XCIII - For a Deceased Friend</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>As for the other person who had the obliterative force, it was my colleague Escobar who on Sunday, before noon, came to have Matacavallos. A friend had thus given me a dead man, and such a friend that for about five minutes he had my hand in his, as if he had not seen me since long months.</p><p>"Do you have dinner with me, Escobar?"</p><p>-I came to this.</p><p>My mother thanked him for the friendship he had with me, and he replied politely, though somewhat tied, as if he had no promising word. You saw that it was not so, the word obeyed him, but man is not always the same at all times. What he said, in short, was that I valued myself for my good qualities and improved education; in the seminary everyone loved me, nor could it stop being that way, he added. He insisted on education, on good examples, "the sweet and rare mother" that the sky gave me ... All this in a choked, trembling voice.</p><p>Everyone liked him. I was as happy as if Escobar were my invention. Jose Dias gave him two superlatives, Uncle Cosme with two cloaks, and Cousin Justina did not find fault with him; then, yes, on the second or third Sunday, she came and confessed to me that my friend Escobar was a bit thick and had police eyes that escaped nothing.</p><p>"It's his eyes," I explained.</p><p>I do not say they belong to another.</p><p>"They are reflected eyes, Uncle Cosimo said.</p><p>"Probably," said Jose Dias, "but it may be that Mrs. D. Justina has a point." The truth is that one thing does not prevent another, and reflection fits very well with natural curiosity. It seems curious, it seems, but ...</p><p>"He seems to be a very good boy," said my mother.</p><p>"Right! confirmed José Dias not to disagree with it.</p><p>When I mentioned to Escobar that opinion of my mother (without telling her the others of course) I saw that his pleasure was extraordinary. She thanked me, saying that they were kindnesses, and she also praised my mother, a grave, distinguished lady and a very young lady.</p><p>"I was forty already," I said, vaguely, out of vanity.</p><p>-It's not possible! exclaimed Escobar. Forty years! It does not look like thirty; She is very young and beautiful. Also, someone has to go out with those eyes that God gave him; are exactly the della. Has it been for many years?</p><p>I told her what I knew of her and my father's life. Escobar listened attentively, asking more, asking for an explanation of missing or dark passages. When I told him that I remembered nothing of the land, so little had come, he told me two or three reminiscences of his three years of age, still fresh now. And did not we expect to return to the countryside?</p><p>"No, we will not be back now. Look, that black man who's passing by is from there. Thomaz!</p><p>-No!</p><p>We were in the garden of my house, and the Negro was on duty; He came to us and waited.</p><p>"He's married," I said to Escobar. Maria, where are you?</p><p>"You're sticking corn, yes, sir.</p><p>"Do you still remember the garden, Thomaz?"</p><p>"Remember, yes, sir."</p><p>-Well, go away.</p><p>I showed another, another, and still another, this Pedro, that Jose, that other Damião ...</p><p>"All the letters of the alphabet," interrupted Escobar.</p><p>As a matter of fact, they were different letters, and only then did I notice this; I also pointed out other slaves, some with the same names, distinguished by an appellido, or person, such as João Fulo, Maria Gorda, or nation like Pedro Benguella, Antonio Moçambique ...</p><p>"And they're all here at home?" he asked.</p><p>-No, some are out on the street, others are rented. It was not possible to have everyone at home. Nor are they all in the field; most of it stayed there.</p><p>"What amazes me is that Dona Gloria was soon accustomed to living in the city, where everything is tight; the one there is of course great.</p><p>"I do not know, but it does. Mama has other houses bigger than this one; but he says he must die here. The others are rented. Some of them are very big, like the street in Quitanda ...</p><p>"I know that; It's beautiful.</p><p>-It's also in Rio Comprido, in Cidade-Nova, one on Cattete ...</p><p>"You will not lack ceilings," he concluded, smiling sympathetically.</p><p>We walked to the bottom. We passed the wash-house; he paused there for a moment, looking at the stone of clattering and making thoughts about the cleanliness; then we continued. What the reflections did not remind me of now; just remind me that I found them ingenious, and laughed, and he laughed too. My joy was with him, and the sky was so blue, and the air so clear, that nature seemed to laugh with us as well. So are the good hours of this world. Escobar confessed this accordo of the intern with the external, by words so fine and high that they moved to me; then, for the purpose of the moral beauty that fits physically, he spoke again of my mother, "an angel doubled," he said.</p><h2>XCIV - Arithmetical Ideas</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Do not say the most, that was a lot. Not even he knew how to praise and think, he also knew how to calculate quickly and well. It was of Holmes's arithmetical heads (2 + 2 = 4). You can not imagine the ease with which it increased or multiplied. The division, which was always one of the operations that was difficult for me, was for him as nothing: he closed his eyes a little, turned upwards, and whispered the denominations of figures: he was prompting. This is seven, thirteen, twenty figures. The vocation was such that it made him love the very signs of the sommas, and he was of the opinion that the numerals, being few, were much more conceptuous than the twenty-five letters of the alphabet.</p><p>"There are inert letters and dispensable letters," he said. What diverse service provides you? It has almost the same sound. The same is true of b and p, the same as s, c and z, the same as k and g, etc. They are calligraphic trapalhices. Look at the figures: there are not two of them doing the same officio; 4 is 4, and 7 is 7. And admire the beauty with which a 4 and a 7 form this thing that is expressed by 11. Now double 11 and will have 22; multiply by eg number, give 484, and so on. But where perfection is greatest is in the employment of zero. The value of zero is in itself nothing; but the officio of this negative signal is precisely to increase. A 5 single is a 5; put it to 00, it's 500. So, what's worthless makes a lot of money, something that does not make the letters doubled, because I both approvo with a p as with two pp.</p><p>Created in the orthography of my parents, it was hard for me to hear such blasphemies, but I did not dare to refute it. Yet one day I uttered a few words of defense, which he replied to be a prejudice, and added that arithmetic ideas could go to infinity, with the advantage that they were easier to wiggle. So I was not able to resolve a philosophical or linguistic problem at the moment, whereas he could sum up, in three minutes, any sums.</p><p>-For example ... give me a case, give me a lot of numbers that I do not know or even know before ... look, give me the number of your mother's houses and the rents of each one, and if I do not say the total sum in two, in a minute, hang me!</p><p>I accepted the bet, and the following week I took the paper and the figures of the houses and the rents to the paper. Escobar took the paper, passed it over his eyes to decorate it, and while I was staring at the watch, he raised the pupils, closed his eyes, and whispered ... Oh! the wind is not faster! It was said and done; in half a minute he was shouting at me:</p><p>-Gives everything 1: 070 $ 000 messages.</p><p>I was stunned. He considered that there were no less than nine houses, and that the rents varied from one to another, ranging from $ 70,000 to $ 180,000. For all this in which I would spend three or four minutes, -and it was to be on paper, "said Escobar de Cór, jokingly. He looked at me triumphantly, and asked if it was not accurate. I, just to show him that yes, I took the paper that carried with the total amount, and I showed it to him; was not even the same, nor an error: 1: 070 $ 000.</p><p>"This proves that arithmetical ideas are simpler, and therefore more natural. Nature is simple. Art is messy.</p><p>I was so enthusiastic about my friend's mental ease that I could not stop myself from hugging him. It was not kicking; other seminarians have noticed our effusion; a priest who was with them did not like it.</p><p>"Modesty," he told us, "does not consent to such excessive gestures; could be estimated in moderation.</p><p>Escobar observed that the others and the priest spoke of envy and proposed to me to live apart. I interrupted him saying no; if it was envy, so much worse for them.</p><p>"Let's break the nut in his mouth!"</p><p>-But...</p><p>"Let's make even more friends than here.</p><p>Escobar squeezed my hand in secret, with such force that my fingers still hurt. It is an illusion, of course, if it is not the effect of the long hours I have been writing without stopping. Let's suspend the penna for a moment ...</p><h2>XCV - The Pope</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Escobar's friendship became great and fruitful; Jose Dias did not want to be behind him. The first week he told me this at home:</p><p>"Now you're going to leave the seminary."</p><p>-As?</p><p>"Wait until tomorrow." I will play with them who called me; tomorrow, in the bedroom, in the yard, or on the street, going to mass, I tell you what you have. The idea is so holy that it is not bad in the sanctuary. Tomorrow, Bentinho.</p><p>"But is it right?"</p><p>-Right!</p><p>The next day he revealed the mysterium to me. To the first aspect, I confess that I was dazzled. It carried a note of greatness and spirituality that spoke in my eyes as a seminarian. It was no less than this. My mother, in her opinion, was sorry for what she had done, and wished to see me here, but she understood that the moral bond of promise bound her indissolubly. He fulfilled Rompel-o, and for that was worth the Scripture, with the power to disconnect given to the apostolos. So that he and I would go to Rome to ask the absolution of the Pope ... What did I think?</p><p>"Sounds good to me," I said after a few seconds of reflection. Could be a good remedy.</p><p>"He's the only one, Bentinho, he's the only one!" I'm going to talk to Don Gloria today, I'll tell you everything, and we can leave here in two months, or before ...</p><p>"It's best to talk next Sunday; let me think first ...</p><p>-Oh! Bentinho! interrupted the aggregate. Think about what? You what you want ... I mean? do not you mate with your old man? You just want to consult a person.</p><p>Strictly, there were two people, Capitú and Escobar, but I denied my feet together that I would consult anyone. And what person, the dean? It was not natural for him to trust her with such a thing. No, no rector, no teacher, no one; it was only the time to reflect, a week, on Sunday I would give the answer, and from now on I said that the idea did not seem bad to me.</p><p>-No?</p><p>-No.</p><p>-Let's decide today.</p><p>"You're not going to Rome joking."</p><p>-Who has bocca goes to Rome, and bocca in our case is the currency. Well, you could very well spend with yourself ... Commigo, no; a pair of trousers, three shirts and the daily bread, I do not need more. I will be like St. Paul, who lived officio while he was preaching the divine word. For I go, do not preach it, but seek it. We will take letters from the internuncio and the bishop, letters to our minister, letters from the Capuchins ... I know the objection that one could oppose this idea; they will say that it is permissible to ask for dispensation from afar; but, besides what I do not say, it is enough to reflect that it is much more solemn and beautiful to see entering the Vatican, and prostrate at the feet of the pope the very object of the favor, the promissed Levite, who is going to ask his mother very tender and sweet the dispensation of God. Consider the picture, you kissing the foot of the prince of the apostles; His Holiness, with the evangelical smile, bows, interrogates, listens, absolves and blesses. The angels contemplate him, the Virgin commends the holy son that all his desires, Bentinho, be satisfied, and that what you love on earth be loved in heaven ...</p><p>I do not say anymore, because we have to finish the chapter, and he did not finish the speech. He spoke to all my feelings as a Catholic and a boyfriend. I saw the soul of my mother, I saw the happy soul of Capitú, both at home, and I with them, and he with us, all through a short trip to Rome, which I only geographically knew where it was; spiritually, too, but the distance from Capitú's will is not. This is the essential point. If Capitú found it far, he would not; but it was necessary to hear it, and so also to Escobar, who would give me good advice.</p><h2>XCVI - A Substitute</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>It expounds to Capitú the idea of ​​Jose Dias. He listened intently, and turned sad.</p><p>"You go," she said, "forget me entirely.</p><p>-Never!</p><p>-Forgets. Europe is said to be so beautiful, and to Italy mainly. Is not that where the singers come from? You forget me, Bentinho. And there will be no other way? D. Gloria is dead for you to leave the seminary.</p><p>"Yes, but you think you're stuck with the promise."</p><p>Capitú did not think of another idea, nor did he adopt it. On the way, he asked me that if he went to Rome, he would swear that at the end of six months he would be back.</p><p>-Swear.</p><p>-For God?</p><p>"For God, for everything. I swear that at the end of six months I will be back.</p><p>"But if the pope has not yet released you?"</p><p>-I mean to say that.</p><p>"What if you lie?"</p><p>This word hurt me a lot, and I did not think I would reply. Capitú got into business loudly, laughing and calling me in disguise. Then he declared that I should take the oath, but he did not consent; I was going to see if there was no other thing, and that I should see it by my side.</p><p>When I returned to the seminary, I told my friend Escobar, who listened to me with equal attention and ended the same sadness of the other. The eyes, usually fleeting, almost ate me with contemplation. Suddenly I saw a flash of light in his face, a reflection of an idea. And I heard him say with volubility:</p><p>"No, Bentinho, you do not need that. There is better, I do not say better, because the Holy Father is always worth more than everything, but there is something that produces the same effect.</p><p>-What is?</p><p>"Your mother made God's promise to give her a priest, would not she?" Well, give him a priest, who is not you. She could well take some good orphan, make him order at his expense, a priest is given to the altar, without you ...</p><p>"I see, I understand, that's right.</p><p>-Do not you think? he continued. Ask about the prothonotary; he will tell you if it is not the same thing, or I even consult you, if you will; and if he hesitates, the bishop is told.</p><p>I, reflecting:</p><p>"Yes, it seems that it is; indeed, the promise is fulfilled, not losing the priest.</p><p>Escobar observed that, on the economic side, the question was easy; my mother would spend the same as me, and an orphan would not need great comforts. He quoted the sum of the rents of the houses, 1: 070 $ 000, besides the slaves ...</p><p>"There is no other thing," I said.</p><p>"And we went out together."</p><p>-You too?</p><p>-Me too. I will improve my Latin and I will leave; nor do I give theology. Latin is not precise; for what in the trade?</p><p>"In hoc signo vinces," I said, laughing.</p><p>I felt pilherous. Oh! as hope rejoices all. Escobar smiled, seeming to like the answer. Then we were taking care of ourselves, each with their lost eyes, probably. The delle were thus, when I came from afar, and I thanked again the plan remembered; could not havel-the better. Escobar listened to me very contentiously.</p><p>"Yet once," he said gravely, "religion and liberty make good company.</p><h2>XCVII - The Exit</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Everything has been done in this way. My mother hesitated a little, but she gave in, after Father Cabral, having consulted the bishop, again said to him, "Yes, it could be. I left the seminary at the end of the year. It was just over seventeen ... Here must be the middle of the book, but the inexperience made me go beyond the penna, and I reach almost to the end of the paper, with the best of the narration to say. Now she no longer has to take her to big strides, chapter on chapter, little amendment, little reflection, all in summary. Already this page is worth for months, others will be worth for years, and thus we will arrive at the end. One of the sacrifices I make to this harsh necessity is to analyze my emotions of the seventeen years. I do not know if you've ever been seventeen years. If so, you must know that it is the age in which half of the man and half of the boy form a curious one. I was a curiosissimo, would say my added Jose Dias, and would not say bad. What this superlative quality gave me could never say it here, without falling into the error I have just condemned; the analysis of my emotions of that time was that it was in my plan. As a son of the seminary and of my mother, I already felt, under the chaste recollection, a certain amount of petulance and daring; were of the blood, but they were also of the girls who in the street or of the window did not let me live socegado. They thought me beautiful, and they said to me; some wanted to take a closer look at my beauty, and vanity is a principle of corruption. </p><h2>XCVIII - Five Years</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>He overcame reason; I went to school. I spent the eighteen years, the nineteen, the twenty, the twenty-one; At twenty-two he was a bachelor's degree in law. Everything had changed around me. My mother had grown old; yet the white hairs came grudgingly, little by little, and scattered; the cap, the dresses, the shallow, deaf shoes were the same as in the past. I would not walk so much around. Uncle Cosme was suffering from his heart and going to sleep. Cousin Justina was just older. Jose Dias also, not so much that he did not do me the courtesy of attending my graduation, and descending with me the saw, lepido and luscious, as if the bachelor was him. The mother of Capitú had died, the father had retired in the same position in which it wanted to give resignation of the life. Escobar began to negotiate in coffee after having worked four years in one of the first houses of Rio de Janeiro. It was the opinion of cousin Justina that he had affiliated the idea of ​​inviting my mother to her second nuptials; but if such an idea were to occur, the great difference of age must not be forgotten. Perhaps he did not think of anything more than to associate her with his first commercial attempts, and in fact, at my request, my mother gave him some money, which he gave back to her as soon as she could, not without this removal: "D. Gloria is fearful and has no ambition. " </p><p>The separation did not cool us. Elle was the third in the exchange of letters between me and Capitú. Ever since seeing her, she has encouraged me so much in our love. The relations he had with Sancha's father narrowed those he already had with Capitú, and he was happy to serve both of us as a friend. At first, it cost her acceital-o, preferred Jose Dias, but Jose Dias disliked me for a remnant of respect of growth. He defeated Escobar; Capitu gave her the first letter, which was the mother and grandmother of the others. Not even after he married did he suspend the gift ... That he married, -better with whom, -he married the good Sancha, the friend of Capitú, quasi sister della, so much that sometimes, writing me, called this one the " his affair. "Thus affinities and kinships, adventures, and books are formed. </p><h2>XCIX - The Son Has the Father's Face</h2><p> </p><p> My mother, when I returned bachelor, almost burst with happiness. I still hear the voice of Jose Dias, remembering the Gospel of St. John, and saying as we embrace each other. "Woman, there is your son!" Son, here is your mother! My mother, in tears: -Mano Cosme, it's the face of the pae, is not it? "Yes, there is something, the eyes, the disposition of the face. It is the pae, a little more modern, he concluded by punishment. And tell me now, sister Gloria, was not it better that he did not stubbornly be a priest? See if this cantor would give a capable priest. - How's my replacement coming? "Go on, get ready for the year," replied Uncle Cosme. You must go and see the ordination; I also, if my lord heart consent. It is good that you feel in the soul of the other, as if you received the consecration in yourself. "Right! exclaimed my mother. But look, my dear Cosimo, see if you are not the figure of my dead. Look, Bentinho, look at me. I always thought you were like him, now it's much more. The mustache is that undoes a little ... -Yes, mana Gloria, the mustache really ... but it's very similar. And my mother kissed me with a tenderness I do not know how to write. Uncle Cosimo, to cheer her up, called me doctor, Jose Dias, and everyone at home, the cousin, the slaves, the visitors, Padova, her daughter, and she herself repeated the title to me. </p><h2>C - "You will be happy, Bentinho!"</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the room, undoing her bag and taking the bachelor's letter out of the can, she was thinking of happiness and glory. He saw marriage and his illustrious career, while Jose Dias was helping me in silence and zeal. An invisible fairy descended there, and said to me in a soft and quiet voice: "You will be happy, Bentinho; you are going to be happy </p><p>"And why would not you be happy?" asked José Dias, straightening his trunk and staring at me. </p><p>-You heard? I asked, looking up at me astonished. </p><p>-I heard what? </p><p>"Did you hear a voice that said I'll be happy?" </p><p>-It's good! You're the one who's saying ... </p><p>Even now I can swear that the voice was of the fairy; naturally the fairies, expelled from the tales and verses, got into the heart of people and talk from inside to outside. This, for example, I have often heard clearly and distinctly. She is to be the cousin of the Sorceresses of Scotland: "You will be king, Macbeth!" - "You will be happy, Bentinho!" In the end, it is the same prediction, by the same universal and eternal touch. When I returned from my astonishment, I heard the rest of José Dias' speech: </p><p>-... He must be happy, as he deserves, just as he deserved that diploma that is there, which is no one's favor. The distinction he made in all matters is proof of this; I have already told you that I heard from the mouth of the glasses, in particular, the highest compliments. Moreover, happiness is not only the glory, it is also something else ... Ah! You did not entrust everything to old Jose Dias! Poor José Dias is there in a corner, it's cashew sucks, it's not worth anything; now they are the new ones, the Escobares ... I do not deny that he is a very distinguished young man, a hardworking man, and a truism husband; but, anyway, old man knows how to love ... </p><p>"But what is it?" </p><p>-What should it be? Who does not know everything? ... That intimacy of neighbors had to end in this, which is truly a blessing of the sky, because she is an angel, is an angel ... Forgive the zinc, Bentinho, was a way to accentuate the perfection of that girl. I took care of the contrary, otherwise; I confused the modes of growth with expressions of character, and I did not see that this girl, cross and already with pensive eyes, was the whimsical flower of a healthy and sweet fructo ... Why did not you tell me also what others know, and here Is house more than guessed and approved? </p><p>"Mother approva devéras?" </p><p>-So? We have talked about it, and she did me the favor of asking my opinion. Ask him what I said to him in clear and positive terms; ask him. I told her that I could not wish for a better daughter-in-law for herself, good, discreet, devoted, friend of ours ... and a housewife, who did not tell her anything. After her mother's death, she took care of everything. Padova, now that he has retired, does no more than receive the salary and give it to his daughter. The daughter is the one who distributes the money, pays the bills, plays the role of expenses, takes care of everything, groceries, clothes, light; you already saw her last year. And as for beauty, you know better than anyone else ... </p><p>"But, devas, Mother asked you about our marriage?" </p><p>"Not really; did me the favor of asking if Capitú would not make a good wife; I'm the one who, in reply, spoke in daughter-in-law. Dona Gloria did not deny it, and even laughed. </p><p>"Every time you write to me, I always talk about Capitú. </p><p>"You know they get along so much, and that's why her cousin is getting pissier. Maybe I'll marry sooner, </p><p>"Just Justina?" </p><p>-Do not know? They are tales, of course; but in the end, Dr. João da Costa has been widowed for a few months, and they say (I do not know, the protonotario he told me) say that the two are half inclined to end widowhood among themselves, marrying each other. You must see that there is nothing, but it is not out of purpose, although she always thought the doctor was a bundle of bones ... Only if she is a cemetery, "he commented laughing; and soon seriously: I say this out of joking ... </p><p>I did not hear the rest. I could hear only the voice of my inner fairy, which repeated to me, but already without words: "You will be happy, Bentinho! "And the voice of Capitú told me the same thing, in different terms, and so did Escobar's, who both confirmed the news of Jose Dias by his own impression. Finally, my mother, a few weeks later, when I asked her to marry me, in addition to her consent, she gave me the same prophecy, saved her mother's own wording: "You will be happy, my son!" </p><h2>CI - In the Sky</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>For let us be happy at one time, before the reader is caught up in it, dead of waiting, and go and let the other party go; let us marry. It was in 1865, one afternoon in March, by a rainy signal. When we reached the top of Tijuca, where our bride and groom nestled, the sky collected the rain and added the stars, not only those already known, but still those that will only be discovered in many centuries. It was great finesse and was not unique. St. Peter, who holds the keys of heaven, opened the gates to him, brought us in, and after touching us with the baculo, recited some verses from his first epistle: "Let women be subject to their husbands. ... Let not the adornment of them be the ornament of curly hair or the lace of gold, but the man who is hidden in the heart .... Likewise, ye husbands, cohabit with them, treating them with honor, like heavier vessels, and heirs with you of the grace of life... "Then he made a signal to the angels, and they sang an excerpt from the Canticle, so in concert, that they would deny the hypothese of the Italian tenor, if execution were in the Earth; but it was in the sky. The music went with the text, as if they had been born together, in the manner of a Wagner opera. Then we visited a part of that infinite place. It descends that I will not make any description, nor does the human language have suitable forms for it. </p><p>After all, it might have been a dream; nothing more natural to an ex-seminarian than to hear throughout Latin and Escriptura. It is true that Capitú, who did not know Escriptura or Latin, decorated some words, such as these, for example: "I sat in the shadow of the one I had longed for." As for Saint Peter, he told me the next day that he was for all that I was the only income and the only ornament I would ever put into it. To which I replied that my wife would always have the finer incomes of this world. </p><h2>CII - Married</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Imagine a watch that only hung, without a dial, so that you could not see the hours written. The pendulum would go from side to side, but no external signal would show the march of time. This was Tijuca's week. </p><p>From time to time we would return to the past and amuse ourselves in remembering our sorrows and calamities, but this was a way of not leaving us. Thus we live again our long waiting for boyfriends, the years of adolescence, the denunciation that is in the first chapters, and we laugh of Jose Dias, who conspired our disunion, and ended up celebrating our consortium. Again and again, we talked about going down, but the mornings were always wet or sunny, and we waited for an overcast day, which was stubborn not to come. </p><p>Nevertheless, I thought that Capitú was somewhat impatient to get off. I agreed to stay, but I kept talking about my mother and my mother, about our lack of news, about this and that, so much so that we got a little confused. I asked her if she was upset with me. </p><p>-I? </p><p>-Looks. </p><p>"You must always be a child," she said, closing my face between my hands and her eyes meeting mine. </p><p>So I waited so many years to bother me in seven days? No, Bentinho; I say this because it is really so, I believe that they could be willing to see us and imagine some disease, and, I confess, for my part, that I wanted to see papae. </p><p>"Well, let's go tomorrow." </p><p>-No; It must be in time, he laughed, laughing. </p><p>I caught him in laughter and in word, but impatience continued, and we came down with sun. </p><p>The joy with which she wore her married hat, and the married air with which she gave me her hand to get in and out of the car, and her arm to walk in the street, all showed me that the cause of Capitú's impatience was the signs of the new state. It was not enough for her to be married between four walls and some trees; I needed the rest of the world too. And when I saw myself downstairs, stepping on the streets with her, stopping, looking, talking, I felt the same thing. I invented walks so that they could see me, confirm me and envy me. In the street, many turned their heads curious, others stopped, some asked: "Who are they?" And a man explained: "This is Dr. Santiago, who married for a few days with that girl, D. Capitolina, after a long children; live in Gloria, the families reside in Matacavallos. "And both of them:" She's a geek! " </p><h2>CIII - Happiness Has a Good Soul</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Moketone is vulgar; Jose Dias thought it was better. It was the only person below who visited us in Tijuca, taking hugs from us and his words, but words that were true songs; I do not put them here to save paper, but they were delicious. One day he compared us to birds raised in two contiguous roof spans. Imagine the rest, the birds feathering their wings and plying the sky, and the sky now wider to contain them as well. None of us laughed; we were both listened to, moved and convinced, forgetting everything, since the afternoon of 1858 .... Happiness has a good soul.</p><h2>CIV - The Pyramids</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>José Dias was now divided between me and my mother, alternating the dinners of Gloria with the lunches of Matacavallos. Everything was going well. After two years of marriage, except for the great displeasure of not having a child, everything was going well. He had lost my father-in-law, it is true, and </p><p>Uncle Cosme was close, but my mother's health was good; our excellente. </p><p>I was a lawyer for some rich houses, and lawsuits were coming. Escobar had made a great contribution to my endeavors. He intervened with a famous lawyer to admit me to his bank, and he arranged for me some proxies, all spontaneously. </p><p>Moreover, our family relations were previously made; Sancha and Capitú were still married to the friendship of the school, Escobar and I of the seminary. Elles lived in Andarahy, wherever they wanted us to go many times, and there could not be as many as we wished, we went there for dinner some Sundays, or they came and made it with us. Dinner is little. We always went very early, after lunch, to enjoy the day long, and we only split at nine, ten, and eleven o'clock, when it could not be more. Now that I think of those days of Andarahy and Glory, I feel that life and the rest are not as hard as the Pyramids. </p><p>Escobar and the woman lived happily; they had a little girl. In time I heard of an adventure of the husband, theater business, I do not know what actress or dancer, but if it was right, did not give scandal. Sancha was modest, the working husband. As one day I told Escobar that I was sorry I did not have a child, he replied: </p><p>- Man, leave it there. God will give them when he wants, and if he does not give them any, he wants them for himself, and they better stay in heaven. </p><p>"A child, a child is the natural complement of life. </p><p>"You'll see, it's only necessary." </p><p>He was not coming. Capitú asked him in his prayers, I more than once gave it to me to pray and pedilate him. It was no longer like growing up; now paid in advance, like the rents of the house. </p><h2>CV - The Arms</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, everything was going well. Capitú liked to laugh and have fun, and in the early days, when we went to the rides or spectacles, it was like a bird that came out of the cage. It was arranged with grace and modesty. Although she liked jewels, like the other girls, she did not want me to buy her many expensive ones, and one day she was so distressed that I promised not to buy any more; but it was only for a short time. </p><p>Our life was more or less placid. When we were not with family or friends, or if we did not go to any show or be private (and these were rare) we spent the nights at our window of Glory, looking at the sea and the sky, the shadow of mountains and ships, or people passing by on the beach. Sometimes I told Capitú the history of the city, others gave him news of astronomy; news of amateur that she listened attentive and curious, not always so much that did not cochilla itself a little. Not knowing the piano, she later learned to be married, and soon, and soon she would play in the houses of friendship. In Gloria it was one of our recreations; also sang, but little and rare, for having no voice; one day came to understand that it was better not to sing anything and fulfilled the directive. He liked to dance and adorned himself with love when he went to a ball; the arms is that ... The arms deserve a period. </p><p>They were beautiful, and on the first night she took them to a ball, I do not think there were any towns in the city, nor her readers, who were then little girls, if they were born, but probably still in the marmore, whence they came, or in the hands of the divine sculptor. They were the most beautiful of the night, to the point that they filled me with fading. He talked badly to other people, just to see them, no matter how much they intertwined with those of other people's coats. It was not like that at the second ball; in that, when I saw that men were not tired of looking at them, of looking for them, almost to ask them, and that they brushed the black sleeves over them, I was vexed and annoyed. To the third I did not go, and here </p><p>I had the support of Escobar, to whom I entrusted my boredom candidly; agreed soon with me. </p><p>"She does not go too, or she'll have long sleeves; the opposite seems to me indecent. </p><p>-It is not? But do not tell me why; they must call us seminarians. Capitú already called me that. </p><p>I did not fail to tell Capitú about Escobar's approbation. Ella smiled and replied that Sanchinha's arms were badly made, but she gave in quickly, and did not go to the ball; to others it was, but it took them half dressed in sackcloth or I do not know what, that neither covered nor discovered altogether, like the shed of Camões. </p><h2>CVI - Ten Pounds Stirling</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I have already said that I am spared, or it is said now, and not only of money but also of things used, of those that are kept by tradition, by remembrance or by nostalgia. Some shoes, for example, shallow black ribbons that crossed each other on the instep and top of the leg, the last ones he wore before wearing boots, brought them home, and took them from far away from the drawer of the commode, with other junk, telling me that they were pieces of growth. My mother, who had the same genius, liked to hear and do so.</p><p>As for the pure savings of money, I will tell a case, and that is enough. It was precisely on the occasion of an astronomical license, at Gloria Beach. You know I made her doze off sometime. One night he lost himself in staring at the sea with such force and concentration that he made me jealous.</p><p>"You do not listen to me, Captain.</p><p>-I? I hear perfectly.</p><p>"What did I say?"</p><p>"You ... you were talking about Sirius."</p><p>"What, Sirius, Capitú. I've told you about twenty minutes of Sirius.</p><p>"He was talking about ... he was talking about Mars," she amended hurriedly.</p><p>Actually, it was from Mars, but of course it just picked up the sound of the word, not the sense. I was serious, and the impetus he gave me was to leave the room; Capitú, realizing it, became the most cuddly of creatures, took me by the hand, confessed to me that he had been counting, that is, summoning some money to discover a certain parcella that he did not think. It was a conversion from paper to gold. At first he supposes that it was a resource for me to unburden myself, but a little while ago I was calculating also, already with paper and pencil, on the knee, and gave the difference that they seek.</p><p>"But what are these pounds?" I asked him in the end.</p><p>Captain looked at me with a laugh, and replied that the fault of breaking the secret was mine. He got up, went into the bedroom, and returned with ten pounds sterling in his hand; were the leftovers of the money I gave him monthly for the expenses.</p><p>-All this?</p><p>"It's not much, ten pounds alone; is what the miser of his wife could arrange, in some months, he concluded by making the gold jingle in his hand.</p><p>-Who was the broker?</p><p>-Your friend Escobar.</p><p>"How did he not tell me anything?"</p><p>-It was today.</p><p>"Elle was here?"</p><p>"Shortly before you arrive; I did not tell you not to be suspicious.</p><p>I wanted to spend twice the gold on some commemorative gift, but Capitú stopped me. On the contrary, he asked me what we should do about those pounds.</p><p>"They are yours," I said.</p><p>"They are ours," he amended.</p><p>"You keep them."</p><p>The next day I went to Escobar to the warehouse, and I laughed at their secret. Escobar smiled and told me that I was to go to my office to tell me everything. The little sister (she still called Capitú) had told him about it on the occasion of our last visit to Andarahy, and told him the reason for the secret.</p><p>"When I told Sanchinha this," she concluded, she was astonished: "How could Capitú save, now that everything is so expensive?" "I do not know, daughter; I know you got ten pounds. "</p><p>"See if she understands too."</p><p>-I do not believe; Sanchinha is not spender, but she is not spared either; I'll give it to you, but that's enough.</p><p>I, after a few moments of reflection:</p><p>-Capitú is an angel!</p><p>Escobar nodded, but without enthusiasm, as if he could not say the same for the woman. So you would think, too, so sure that the virtues of the near people give us such or such vanity, pride or consolation.</p><h2>CVII - Jealous of the Sea</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>If it were not for astronomy, I would not have discovered the ten pounds of Capitul so soon; but that is not why I return to it, so that you do not think that the vanity of a teacher is what made me suffer with the disregard of Capitú and be jealous of the sea. No my friend. I came to explain to you that I had such jealousy for what might have been on my wife's head, not above or above it. It is well known that the distractions of a person can be guilty, half guilty, a third, a fifth, a tenth of guilty, because in matters of guilt the graduation is infinite. The memory of simple eyes is enough to fix others who remember them and delight in their imaginations. It is not an effective and mortal sin, nor a changed paper, a simple word, a nod, a sigh, or an even lighter and milder signal. Anonymo or anonyma that passes the corner of the street causes us to put Sirius inside Mars, and you know, reader, the difference they have from one to another in distance and size, but astronomy has these confusions. This is what made me pallid, silent, and want to run away from the room to return. God knows when; probably ten minutes later. Ten minutes later, I would either be in the room again, at the piano or at the window, continuing the interruption: </p><p>-Marte is at a distance from ... </p><p>So little time? Yes, so little time, ten minutes. My jealousy was intense, but short; with little he would overthrow everything, but with the same little or less he would rebuild the sky, the earth and the stars. The truth is that I was more friends with Capitú, if it was possible, she was even gentler, the air more subdued, the nights lighter, and God, God. And it was not really the ten pounds that did this, nor the sense of economy they revealed and that I knew, but the cautions that Capitú employed to discover my day-to-day care. Escobar also got closer to my heart. Our visits have become closer, and our conversations more intimate. </p><h2>CVIII - A Son</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>For all this did not kill me the son of a son, a sad boy who was yellow and thin, but a son, a son of my own. When we went to Andarahy and saw the daughter of Escobar and Sancha, familiarly called the Capitulina, in spite of my wife's dissimilarity, since they gave the same name to the sink, we were filled with envy. The little one was graceful and plump, talkative and curious. The parents, like the other parents, told of the girl's mischief and wit, and when we came back to Gloria in the evening, we came sighing our envy, and begging the sky to kill them.</p><p>... The envy died, the hopes were born, and soon the fruit of the world came. It was not scanty or ugly, as I asked, but a sturdy, handsome fellow.</p><p>My joy when he was born, I do not know how to say it; I have never had it, nor do I believe that there may be an identical one, or that it may be closely or closely related to it. It was vertigo and madness. He did not sing on the street because of natural shame, or at home, in order not to afflict convalescent Capitú. It also did not fall, because there is a god for the new paes. He lived with the spirit in the boy; at home, with his eyes, watching him, looking at him, asking him where he came from, and why I was so entirely in him, and several other nonsense without words, but thought or delirious at every moment. Maybe I lost some causes in the car by careless.</p><p>Capitú was no less tender to him and to me. We clasped each other, and when we did not look at our son, we talked about ourselves, our past and our future. The hours of greatest charm and mystery were those of breastfeeding. When I saw my son sucking his mother's milk, and all that union of nature to the nourishment and life of a being that was nothing, but that our destiny affirmed that it would be, and our constancy and our love made it I could not say or say; positively does not remember me, and I fear that what I said would make me dark.</p><p>Escusai minucias. So it is not necessary to tell the dedication of my mother and Sancha, who also went to spend with Capitú the first days and nights. Quiz reject Sandia's gift; he replied that I had nothing to do with it; also Capitú, as an unmarried woman, had gone to the street of the Invalids.</p><p>"Do not you remember that you went there?"</p><p>"Remind me; more Escobar ...</p><p>"I will come to dinner with you, and at night I will go to Andarahy; eight days, and it's all past. Well you can see that you're a first-time dad.</p><p>-You too; where is the second</p><p>We used these graces as a family. Today, when I have returned to my misery, I do not know if there is such a language yet, but there must be. Escobar did what he said; he dined with us, and went away at night. About afternoon we went down to the beach or went to the Promenade, doing his calculations, I did my dreams. I saw my son doctor, lawyer, dealer, met him in several universities and banks, and even accepted the hypothese of being a poet. The possibility of a politician was consulted, and I believed that I was a speaker, and a great speaker.</p><p>"It could be, Escobar's redoubt; nobody would say what came to be Desmosthenes.</p><p>Escobar accompanied my creations many times; also questioned the future. He even talked about the hypothese of marrying the child to his daughter. Friendship exists; was all in the hands with which I pressed Escobar's, upon hearing this, and in the utter absence of words with which I assigned the covenant; these came afterwards, run over, tuned by the heart, which struck with great force. Accepted the memory, and proposes that we send them to this end, for the same and common education, for the united and correct childhood.</p><p>It was my idea that Escobar was the boy's godfather; the godmother should be and would be my mother. But the first part was changed by the intervention of Uncle Cosme, who, upon seeing his birth, told him among other affections</p><p>"Go on, bless your godfather, you rascal."</p><p>And, turning to me:</p><p>"I do not give up the favor; and the baptized must soon be, before my sickness takes me from time to time.</p><p>I discreetly told the anecdote to Escobar, so that he would understand and excuse me; she laughed and did not hurt herself. He did more, hoping that the baptiste's luncheon was in the chacara delle, and he went. I still tried to space the ceremony to see if Uncle Cosimo succumbed first to the disease, but it seems that this was more to annoy than to kill. There was no remedy other than to take the child to the sink, where he was given the name of Ezekiel; it was Escobar's, and I wanted to fill the lack of compadrio in this way.</p><h2>CIX - A Unique Child</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ezekiel, when the previous chapter began, was not yet begotten; when it was over, it was Christian and Catholic. This other is destined to bring my Ezekiel at the age of five, a handsome young man, with his clear eyes, already restless, as if they wanted to date all the girls of the neighborhood, or almost all. Now, if you consider that he was unique, that no one else came, certain or uncertain, dead or alive, one and only, you will imagine the care he gave us, the somnions he took from us, and what scares us the crises of teeth and others, the smallest febricula, all the common existence of the creations. We went to everything, according to what was necessary and urgent, something that was not necessary to say, but there are readers who are so obtuse, who do not understand anything, if they do not report everything and the rest. Let's go to the rest.</p><h2>CX - Childhood Traits</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The rest still eat me many chapters; there are lives that have less of them, and still become complete and finished.</p><p>At five and six years, Ezekiel did not seem to contradict my dreams of Glory's beach; on the contrary, all possible vocations could be divined in him, from idle to apostle. Vadio is here put in the good sense, in the sense of a man who thinks and says; He would sometimes meditate with himself, and in this he reminded his mother from an early age. So, too, everything stirred and urged me to go and persuade the women that the sweets I brought to her were sweet devas; they did not do it before they were tired of them, but the apostles did not carry good doctrine until after they had it all in their hearts. Escobar, a good merchant, thought that the main cause of this other inclination might be to implicitly invite the ministers to the same apostolate when the paes brought him candy; and he laughed at his own grace, and told me that he would make him his partner.</p><p>I liked music, not less than sweet, and I told Capitú to take the piano from the black one of Matacavallos' cocadas ...</p><p>"You do not remember me."</p><p>-Do not say that; you do not remember that black that sold sweet, in the evenings ...</p><p>"I remember a black man who sold candy, but I do not know about it.</p><p>"Not the words?"</p><p>-No of the words.</p><p>The reader, who will still remember the words, given that she has read me with attention, will be astonished at such forgetfulness, all the more so as to remind her of the voices of her childhood and adolescence; there will be some forgotten, but not everything is in the head. So said Capitú to me, and I found none. I did, however, what she did not expect; I ran to my old papers. In Sao Paulo, when I was a student, I asked a music teacher to transcribe me to the press of the press; he did it with pleasure (it was enough for me to repeat it by heart), and I kept the little paper; I went to procural. D'ahi soon interrupted a romance she played, with the little piece of paper in her hand. I explained it to him; she keyed in the sixteen notes.</p><p>Capitú found a particular flavor, almost delicious; told his son the history of the prey, and so he sang and keyed it. Ezekiel took advantage of the music to ask me to disentangle the text by giving him some money.</p><p>He was a doctor, a military man, an actor and a dancer. I never gave him oratories; but the horses of the sword and the sword were with him. I no longer speak of the battalions that passed in the street, and that he ran to see: all the creancas do. What they do not all do is have the eyes they had. In no way did he see the pleasure of the troop, and he heard the march of the drums.</p><p>-Look, papae! Look!</p><p>"I see, my son!</p><p>Look at the commander! Look at the commander's cavallo! Look at the soldiers!</p><p>One day he was playing trumpet with his hand; I gave him a little metal cornet. I bought him lead soldiers, battle pictures that he had been looking at for a long time, wanting him to explain a piece of artillery, a fallen soldier, one with a raised sword, and all his loves went to the sword with a raised sword. One day (naive!) He asked me impatiently:</p><p>"But, Papa, why does not he let his sword fall at once?"</p><p>"My son, it's because it's painted.</p><p>"But then why did he paint himself?"</p><p>I laughed at the deception and explained that it was not the soldier who had painted himself on the paper, but the tape recorder, and I had to explain also what was a tape recorder and what was an engraving: the curiosities of Captain Summa.</p><p>These are the main features of childhood: one more and I finish the chapter. One day, in Escobar's chacara, he found a cat that had a rat in its mouth. The cat did not leave its prey, nor did it see where it had fled. Ezekiel said nothing, stopped, crouched, and stared. When we saw him thus, we asked him from afar what he was; made us signal that we should be calmed. Escobar concluded:</p><p>"You'll see it's the cat that caught some time." The rats continue to infest me the house, which is the devil. We will see.</p><p>Capitú also wanted to see his son; I accompanied them. Effectively, it was a cat and a mouse, banal bid, without interest or grace. The only particular circumstance was that the rat was alive, kicking, and my little son of a bitch. Besides, the instant was short. The cat, as soon as it felt more people, it disposed to run; the boy, without taking his eyes off him, made another signal of silence; and the silence could not be greater. I was going to say religious, I stumbled over the word, but here I put it again, not only because it signified the totality of the silence, but also because there was something in the cat and the mouse something that held ritual. The only rumor was the last hoot of the mouse, and we laughed; his legs were barely moving and disorderly. Somewhat annoyed, I clapped my hands so the cat would run away, and the cat ran away. The others did not even have time to cut me short, Ezekiel was depressed.</p><p>-Ora, papae!</p><p>-What is it? At this time the mouse is eaten.</p><p>"Yes, but I wanted to see.</p><p>The two of them laughed; I myself found it amusing.</p><h2>CXI - Count Up Quickly</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I found it amusing, and I do not deny it to you now, despite the past tense, of the successes that have taken place, and of this or that sympathy to the mouse that I find in me; had grace. I do not mind telling him; those who love nature as she wants to be loved, without partial repudiation or unjust exclusions, do not find anything inferior to her. I love the mouse, I do not dislike the cat. I've thought about making them live together, but I've seen that they're incompatible. In truth, one gnaws me the books, another the cheese; but it is not much that I forgive you if I have already forgiven a dog who has taken my rest in worse circumstances. I'll tell the case quickly. </p><p>That's when Ezekiel was born; his mother had a fever, Sancha lived by her, and three dogs on the street barked all night. I looked for the prosecutor, and it was as if I were looking for the reader, who only now knows this. So I decided to kill them; I bought poison, I had three balls of meat, and I put the drugs myself. At night, I left; it was an hour; neither the patient nor the nurse could sleep with the sound of dogs. When they saw me, they moved away, two of them descended to the side of the Flamengo beach, one stood a short distance, as if waiting. I went to him, whistling and tapping his fingers. The devil still barked, but relied on the signs of friendship, he kept quiet until he was silent. As I continued, he came to me, slowly, wagging his tail, which is his way of laughing at them; I had poisoned balls already in my hand, and I was going to throw one of them in, when that special laughter, affection, confidence or whatever, bound me at will; I stayed like this, I do not know how, touched with feather and I kept the balls in my pocket. It seemed to the reader that it was the scent of the flesh that sent the dog into silence. I do not say no; I take care that he did not want to attribute me a perfidy to the gesture, and he surrendered to me. The bottom line is he got rid of it.</p><h2>CXII - The Imitations of Ezekiel</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Such would not Ezekiel. I would not make poisoned balls, I suppose, but I would not turn them down either. What he would do for sure was to go after the dogs, the stone, as far as his legs would go. And if I had a stick, I'd go stick. Capitú died for that future battler.</p><p>"It does not leave us, that we like peace," she told me one day, "but Papa was still young like that; Mommy counted.</p><p>"Yes, you will not," I replied; I only find you a defect, like to imitate others.</p><p>-Imitar how?</p><p>-Immit the gestures, the manners, the altitudes; mimes cousin Justina, imitates Jose Dias; I've even found you a little bit of Escobar's feet and eyes ...</p><p>Capitú let himself be thinking and looking at me, and said at last that it was necessary to mend him. Now he saw that it was really his son's turn, but it seemed to him that it was only imitation to imitate, as it happens to many great people, who take the ways of others; and so that it would not go further ...</p><p>"We will not mortify him, either. There's always time to correct it.</p><p>-Ha, I'll see. You were not like that either, when you were angry with someone ...</p><p>"When I was angry, I agree; boy revenge.</p><p>"Yes, but I do not like imitations at home.</p><p>"And you liked me at that time?" I said, striking him in the face.</p><p>The Capitú's answer was a sweet laughter, one of those laughter that is not described, and will only be painted; then he stretched out his arms and threw them on his shoulders, so full of grace that they looked like a picture of flowers. I did the same to mine, and I felt that there was not a sculptor there that would transfer us the altitude to a piece of marble. Only the artist would shine, that's right. When a person or group does well, no one wants to know about the model, but about the work, and the work remains. Does not matter; we would know it was us.</p><h2>CXIII - Third Party Liens</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the way, it is only natural that you ask me if I had been so jealous of it, I did not continue to seal it despite my son and my years. Yes, sir, I continued. I continued, to the extent that the slightest gesture afflicted me, the most intimate word, any insistence: only the indifference was enough. I became jealous of everything and everyone. A neighbor, a pair of waltz, any man, young or old, filled me with terror or suspicion. It is certain that Capitú liked to be seen, and the means most appropriate for that purpose (one lady told me one day) is to see also, and not to see without showing that it is seen.</p><p>The lady who told me this, I think she liked me, and it was of course that I did not find correspondence to her affections that her stubborn eyes explained to me in that way. Other eyes looked for me, not many, and I say nothing about them, having in the first instance confessed my adventures to come, but they were yet to come. At that time, as many beautiful women as she could find, none would receive the least of the love she had for Capitú. My own mother did not want more than half. Capitú was everything and more than anything; he did not live or work unless he thought about her. To theatro we went together; just reminds me that it was twice without her, an actor's benefit, and an operatic debut, which she did not get because I got sick, but I wanted to be. It was late to send the cabin to Escobar; I left, but I came back at the end of the first act. I found Escobar at the door of the hall.</p><p>"He came to tell you," he told me.</p><p>I explained to him that he had left for the theater, where he had returned from the fear of Captain, who had been ill.</p><p>-Sick from what? asked Escobar.</p><p>He whirled his head and stomach.</p><p>-So, I'm leaving. He was coming to that business of foreclosures ...</p><p>They were third-party embargos; There had been an important incident, and when he had dined in the city, he did not want to go home without telling me what it was, but he would speak later.</p><p>"No, let's talk now, umbe; she could be better. If it is worse, you go down.</p><p>Capitú was better and even good. He confessed that he had only had a headache of nothing, but he had aggravated the suffering so that I would amuse myself. He did not speak cheerful, which made me suspect that he was lying, so as not to frighten me, but he swore that it was pure truth. Escobar smiled and said,</p><p>"The little sister is as sick as you or me." Let's go to the foreclosures.</p><h2>CXIV - The Explanation</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Before going to the embargoes, let us explain a point that has already been explained, but not well explained. You see, I asked a professor of music from São Paulo to write me the song of that sweet pastry from Matacavallos. In itself, matter is chocha, and not worth of a chapter, the more two; but there are subjects that bring interesting, if not agreeable, teachings. Let's explain the explanation.</p><p>Capitú and I had vowed not to forget that prisoner; it was in a moment of great tenderness, and the divine tabellion knows the things that are swear at such times, he who registers them in the eternal books.</p><p>-You swear?</p><p>"I swear," she said, tragically extending her arm.</p><p>I took the gesture to kiss his hand; I was still at the seminary. When I went to Sao Paulo, wanting one day to remember the toada, I saw that I was losing it entirely; I managed to remember it and ran to the teacher, who gave me the gift of writing it on the piece of paper. It was not to be without oath that I did this. But do you think that when I ran to the old papers on that night of Glory, I also did not remember the toada or the text? I made my oath punctual, and this was my sin; Forget, any forget.</p><p>To be sure, no one knows whether or not to keep an oath. Future things! Therefore, our political constitution, transferring the oath to simple affirmation, is deeply moral. It ended with a terrible sin. Failure to compromise is always unfaithful, but to someone who has more fear of God than men would not mind lying, one time or another, as long as he does not put his soul into purgatory. Do not confuse purgatory with hell, which is the eternal shipwreck. Purgatorio is a pawnshop, which lends on all virtues, high interest and short term. But the deadlines renew themselves, until one day one or two medium virtues pay for all the big and small sins.</p><h2>CXV - View Forum Posts</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>We are going to the embargoes now ... And why do we go to the foreclosures? God knows what it costs to write them, the more you tell them. From the new circumstance that Escobar brought me, I only say what I told him then, that is, that it was not worth anything.</p><p>-Anything?</p><p>"Nothing.</p><p>"Then it's worth something."</p><p>"To reinforce the reasons we already have is worth less than the tea you are going to take with me."</p><p>"It's late for tea."</p><p>- We'll have it soon.</p><p>We took it quickly. During him, Escobar was looking at me suspiciously, as if he were careful that I refused the new circumstance for covering me to write it; but such suspicion did not go with our friendship.</p><p>When he left, I mentioned my doubts to Capitú; she dislodged them with the fine art she possessed, a shade, a grace all her own, capable of dispelling the same sorrows of Olympio.</p><p>"It would be the business of two embargoes," he concluded; and he who has come so far, at this hour, is impressed by the demand.</p><p>-You're right.</p><p>Word pulls the word, I spoke of other doubts. I was then a well of them; they crouched inside me, like real rans, to the point that they took the somno sometimes. I told him that I was beginning to find my mother a little cold, and I was in no hurry with her. For here it was worth the fine art of Capitú!</p><p>Ja told you what it is; mother-in-law. Mamãeinha is jealous of you; As soon as they pass by and miss them augmentem, she becomes what she was again. In missing his grandson ...</p><p>"But I have noticed that it is already cold with Ezekiel. When he goes with me, Mother does not thank him.</p><p>"Who knows if he's not sick?"</p><p>"Are we going to have dinner with her tomorrow?"</p><p>Let's go ... No ... Let's go.</p><p>We went to dinner with my old lady. He could already call it that, since his white hair was neither all nor wholly, and his face comparatively cool; it was a kind of quinquagenarian youth or of the lush old age, the choice ... But no melancholy; he does not want to talk about wet eyes, in and out. Little entered the conversation. She was not unlike the usual. Jose Dias spoke of marriage and its beauties, of politics, of Europe and of homeopathia, Uncle Cosimo of his discomfort, cousin Justina of the neighborhood, or of Jose Dias, as he left the room.</p><p>When we came back at night, we came by on foot, talking about my doubts. Capitú again advised me to wait. Sogras were all like this; there came a day and they changed. As she spoke to me, she grew more tender. Dalli in deante was more and more sweet to me; I was not going to wait for the window, so as not to be jealous, but when I went upstairs I could see the delightful face of my friend and wife, laughing like all of our childhood, at the top of the stairs, between the bars of the cancella. Ezequiel was sometimes with her; we had accustomed him to the sight of the arrival and the exit, and he would fill my face with kisses.</p><h2>CXVI - Son of the Man</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I appraised Jose Dias about my mother's new ways; He was astonished. There was nothing, nor could there be anything, so many were the incessant praises that he heard "the beautiful and virtuous Capitú."</p><p>"Now, when I hear them, I enter the chamber, but at the beginning I was ashamed. To those who came, as I did, to deny this marriage, it was hard to confess that it was a true blessing of heaven. What a worthy lady we left the mischievous growth of Matacavallos! The father is who separated us a little, in that we did not know each other, but everything turned out well. Well, yes, sir, when D. Gloria praises her daughter-in-law and mother-in-law ...</p><p>"So, Mom?"</p><p>-Perfectly!</p><p>"But why do not you visit us for so long?"</p><p>"I think you've been stumbling over your rheumatisms." This year has been very cold ... Imagine the affliction of her, who walked all day; now she is obliged to be quiet, at the foot of her brother, who has her evil ...</p><p>To observe that this reason explained the interruption of the visits, not the coldness when we went to Matacavallos; but I did not extend the intimacy of the addict so far. Joseph Dias asked to see our "little prophet" (so he called Ezekiel) and made him the usual feasts. This time he spoke to the Bible mode (he had been browsing the book of Ezekiel, as he learned later), and asked him, "How is it, son of man?" "Tell me, son of man, where are your Do you want to eat sweet, son of man? "</p><p>"What son of man is that," Capitú asked in frustration.</p><p>"These are the ways of saying the Bible.</p><p>"I do not like them," she replied harshly.</p><p>"You're right, Capitú," agreed the addressee. You can not imagine how the Bible is full of crude and crude expressions. I used to say that for a change ... How are you, my angel? My angel, how do I walk on the street? </p><p>"No," said Capitú; I have taken away this custom from imitating others. </p><p>"But it's very funny; to me, when he copies my gestures, it seems to me that I am myself, little one. </p><p>Another day he made a gesture of D. Gloria, so good that she kissed him in return. Come on, how do I walk? </p><p>"No, Ezekiel, I said, Mother does not want to. </p><p>I myself thought it was ugly. Some of the gestures were already becoming more repeated, like Escobar's hands and feet; lately, he had even learned how to get back from his head when he spoke, and let him fall when he laughed. Capitú scolded. But the boy was mischievous, like the devil; we just started talking about something else, jumped in the middle of the room, saying to José Dias: </p><p>"You're like this. </p><p>We can not stop laughing, I more than anyone. The first person who closed the face, who reproached him and called him was Capitú. </p><p>"I do not want that, do you?" </p><h2>CXVII - Close Friends</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Even then, Escobar had left Andarahy and bought a house in Flamengo, a house I had still seen there for days, when I had the desire to try whether the old sensations were dead or only slept; I can not say it well, because somnios, when they are heavy, confuse living and deceased, except breathing. I was breathing a little, but it might have been from the sea, a little agitated. At last I passed, I lit a cigar, and found myself on the Cattete; had climbed the street of the Princeza, an old street ... O ancient streets! O old houses! O old legs! We were all old, and needless to say that in the wrong sense, in the sense of old and finished.</p><p>Old is the house, but it did not change anything. I do not know if it still has the same number. I do not say what number they are so they will not go and dig up the story. It is not that Escobar lives there or even lives; died shortly after, by a way that I will tell. While he lived, since we were so close, we had a single house, I lived in it, and in it, and the piece of beach between Gloria and Flamengo was like a path of private and private use. It made me think of the two houses of Matacavallos, with their wall of permeation.</p><p>A historian of our language, I believe that Joao de Barros, puts in the mouth of a barbarian king some soft words, when the Portuguese proposed to establish there at the foot a fortress; said the king that good friends should stay away from each other, not near, so as not to be angry like the waters of the sea that beat raging in the rock that they saw dalli. Let the shadow of the writer forgive me, if I doubt that the king would say such a word, or that it be true. It was probably the same writer who invented it to adorn the text, and did no harm, because it is beautiful; really, it's beautiful. I believe that the sea then struck the stone, as it has been her custom, since Ullysses and before. Now that the comparison is true, it is not. Surely there are contiguous enemies, but there are also close friends and the chest. And the writer forgot (except if it was not his time) he forgot the adage: far from the eyes, far from the heart. We could not have our hearts now closer. Our women lived in each other's house, we spent the night here or there talking, playing or watching the sea. The two little ones spent days, now in Flamengo, now in Gloria.</p><p>As I observed that what could happen to them had happened between me and Capitú, they found all that they did, and Sancha added that they were already appearing. I explained:</p><p>-No; it is because Ezekiel imitates the gestures of others.</p><p>Escobar agreed with me, and insinuated that some of the grown-ups are very often end up looking like one another. I nodded, as it succeded in matters I did not know good or bad. Everything could be. The truth is that they loved each other very much, and could get married, but they did not get married.</p><h2>CXVIII - The Hand of Sancha</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Everything is over, reader; is an old truism, which could be added that not everything that lasts lasts a long time. This second part does not find believers easy; On the contrary, the idea that a wind chateau lasts longer than the same wind from which it is made will be difficult to take off from the head, and it is good that it be so that the custom of those quasi-eternal constructions may not be lost.</p><p>Our castello was solid, but a Sunday ... We had spent the night in Flamengo, not only the two inseparable houses, but also the one added and cousin Justina. It was then that Escobar, telling me the window, told me to go and have dinner the next day; we needed to talk about a family project, a project for all four.</p><p>"For all four?" A contradiction.</p><p>-No. You can not guess what it is, nor do I say it. Come tomorrow.</p><p>Sancha did not take his eyes from us during the conversation, at the corner of the window. When her husband left, she came to see me. He asked me what we should do; I told him of a project that I did not know what it was; she asked me a secret, and she told me what it was: a trip to Europe for two years. He said this with his back to the inside, almost sighing. The sea hit the shore with great force; there was hangover.</p><p>"Shall we all?" I asked at last.</p><p>-Let's go.</p><p>Sancha raised his head and looked at me with such pleasure that I, thanks to her relations and Capitú, would not give me a kiss on her forehead. However, Sancha's eyes did not invite fraternal expansions, they seemed warm and intimate, they said another thing, and soon they moved away from the window, where I stared thoughtfully at the sea. The night was clear.</p><p>I even looked for Sancha's eyes at the piano; I found them on the way. They stopped the four and stood before each other, some waiting for the others to pass, but none passed. Such is the case in the street between two stubborn ones. Caution turned us off; I turned back to myself. And so I went in to dig in the memory if I had ever looked at her with the same expression, and I was uncertain. I had only one certainty, that one day I thought of her, as one thinks of the beautiful stranger that passes; but then she would have guessed it... Perhaps the simple thought had translated me here, and she had fled to me angrily or a little, and now by an invincible movement ... Invincible; this word was like a blessing from priest to mass, which we receive and repeat in itself.</p><p>"The sea is about to challenge us tomorrow," Escobar's voice told me.</p><p>"Do you enter the sea tomorrow?"</p><p>I've come in with bigger, bigger seas. "" You can not imagine what a good sea is in rough weather. It is necessary to swim well, as I do, and to have these lungs, "he said, striking his chest, and these arms; feel</p><p>I felt his arms, as if they were Sancha's. It costs me this confession, but I can not supprimil it; was to hock the truth. I did not even touch them with this idea, but I still felt something else: I found them thicker and stronger than mine, and I envied them; accresce that they knew how to swim.</p><p>When we left, I spoke again to the mistress of the house. Her hand tightened on mine, and it lingered longer than usual.</p><p>Modesty then demanded, as now, that I should see in Sancha's gesture a sanction for her husband's plan and a thank-you. It must have been so, but a particular fluid that ran all over my body took away the conclusion I am writing. I felt Sancha's fingers still between mine, squeezing each other. It was an instant of vertigo and sin. He passed quickly in the clock of time; when I got the watch in my ear, only the minutes of virtue and reason worked.</p><p>"... A most delightful lady," concluded Jose Dias, a speech he had been making.</p><p>-Deliciosissima! I repeated with some ardor, which I soon tempered, mended me: Really, a beautiful night!</p><p>"What must be all of that house," continued the guest. Not now; here the sea is angry; Listen.</p><p>The strong sea was heard, as was already heard from home, the hangover was great, and from a distance the waves were growing. Capitú and Cousin Justina, who were on their way, stopped at one of the laps of the beach, and we all talked; but I was talking badly. There was no way to completely forget Sancha's hand or the eyes we exchanged. Now I found this to you, now I have it. The instants of the devil intercalated in the minutes of God, and the clock was thus marking alternatively my perdition and my salvation. Jose Dias said goodbye to us at the door. Prima Justina slept in our house; he would leave the next day after lunch and Mass. I went back to my office, where I lingered longer than usual.</p><p>The portrait of Escobar, which I had there, at the foot of my mother, spoke to me as if it were the person himself. I sincerely fought the impulses I brought from Flamengo; I rejected the figure of my friend's wife, and I called myself disloyal. Besides, who said that there was any intention of that species in the gesture of farewell and in previous ones? Everything could be connected to the interest of our trip. Sancha and Capitú were so friendly that it would be a pleasure for them to go together. When there was any sexual intention, who would prove to me that it was a glowing sensation, destined to die with night and somnio? There are remorse that they are not born of another sin, nor have a longer duration. I clung to this hypothese that reconciled with Sancha's hand, which I felt by heart in my hand, warm and long, tight and squeezing ...</p><p>Honestly, I felt bad between a friend and the attraction. Timidity might have been another cause of that crisis; it is not only the sky that gives our virtues, the shyness also, not counting chance, but chance is an accident; the best origin of them is the sky. However, since shyness comes from the sky, which gives us the complexion, virtue, daughter of it is, genealogically, the same celestial blood. That way he would think, if he could; but at first I wandered. Passion was neither inclination. Caprice would or what? After twenty minutes it was nothing, nothing at all. The picture of Escobar seemed to speak to me; I saw the straightforward altitude, I shook my head and went to lie down.</p><h2>CXIX - Do Not Do It, My Dear</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The reader, who is my friend and opened this book in order to rest from the cavatina de hontem to the waltz of today, wants to shut it hastily, when we see that we border an abysm. Do not do it, my dear; I change course.</p><h2>CXX - The Cars</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The next morning I came out free from the abominations of the evening; I called them allucinations, I had coffee, I went through the newspapers and went to study some cars. Capitú and Cousin Justina left for Mass at nine in Lapa. The figure of Sancha disappeared entirely in the middle of the allegations of the adverse party, which I read in the records, false allegations, inadmissible, without support in the law or praxes. I saw that it was easy to win the suit; I consulted Dalloz, Pereira and Souza ... </p><p>Once I looked at Escobar's portrait. It was a beautiful photograph taken a year earlier. He was standing, a button-up frock coat, his left hand on the back of a chair, his right at his chest, his gaze far away to the viewer's left. He had grace and naturalness. The frame I sent him did not cover the dedication, written underneath, not on the back of the card: "To my dear Bentinho, your dear Escobar 20-4-70." These words strengthened my thoughts that morning, and they beat everything the memories of the evening. At that time my sight was good; I could read them from the log where I was. I turned to cars. </p><h2>CXXI - The Catastrophe</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>At the best of them, I heard footsteps on the stairs, the bell rang, clapping, blows in the cancella, voices, all came, I went myself. I was a slave of Sancha's house who called me: </p><p>"To go there ... a little swimming, a little dying." </p><p>He did not say anything else, or I did not hear the rest. I dressed, left word for Capitú, and ran to Flamengo. </p><p>On the way, I was guessing the truth. Escobar went swimming, as he used to do, ventured a little harder than usual, despite the rough sea, was curled up and died. The canoes who came in poorly were able to bring him the corpse. </p><h2>CXXII - The Burial</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The widow ... I spare you the tears of the widow, mine, those of other people. He leaves about eleven o'clock; Capitú and cousin Justina were waiting for me, one with the look of a low, stupid opinion, the other only annoyed.</p><p>"They'll keep poor Sanchinha company; I'm going to take care of the funeral.</p><p>This is how we did it. Perhaps the burial was pompous, and the affluence of the friends was numerous. Beach, streets, Plaza da Gloria, everything was cars, many of them private. The house, not being large, could not fit all there; many were on the beach talking about the disaster, pointing to the place where Escobar died, when he heard the arrival of the dead man. José Dias also heard about the deceased's business, diverting some in the valuation of assets, but there was an agreement that the liabilities should be small. They praised the qualities of Escobar. One or the other discussed the recent Rio Branco cabinet; it was March 1871. I never forgot the month or the year.</p><p>As I had decided to speak at the cemetery, I wrote a few lines and showed them at home to Jose Dias, who found them really worthy of the dead and me. He asked me for the paper, slowly recited the speech, weighing the words, and confirmed the first opinion; in Flamengo spread the news. Some acquaintances came to question me:</p><p>"Let's hear it, then?"</p><p>"Four words.</p><p>Few more would be. I had them written for fear that the emotion would stop me from improvising. In the Tilbury where I had been for an hour or two, I had merely recalled the time of the seminary, Escobar's relations, our sympathies, our friendship, begun, continued and never interrupted, until a toss of fortune separated forever two creatures that promise to stay together for a long time. From time to time he wiped his eyes. The coachman ventured two or three questions about my moral situation; not pulling me anything, continued his officio. Arriving home, I threw those emotions into the paper; such would be the discourse.</p><h2>CXXIII - Hangover Eyes</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>At last, it was time for the ordering and the departure. Sancha wanted to say good-bye to her husband, and the despair of that move shocked them all. Many men were crying too, all women. Only Capitú, embracing the widow, seemed to be defeating herself. He was consoling the other, he wanted to get her out of it. The confusion was general. In the middle of it, Captain looked for a few moments at the corpse so fixed, so passionately fixed, that no wonder some short, silent tears leapt out ... </p><p>Mine ceased soon. I went to see della; Capitú wiped them quickly, looking at the swipe at the people in the room. He corrected her friend with caresses, and he took her away; but the corpse looks like it's too. There was a moment when Capitú's eyes stared at the dead man, those of the widow, without the mourning or words of this, but large and open, as the wave of the sea was there, as if it were to swallow the swimmer in the morning. </p><h2>CXXIV - The Speech</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>- Come on, it's time ... </p><p>It was José Dias who invited me to close the coffin. Fechámol-o, and I took one of the rings; broke the final whine. When I arrived at the door, I saw the clear sun, all the people and the cars, the heads uncovered, I had one of my impulses that never got to the execution: it was to shoot the street box, dead and everything. In the car he told José Dias to shut up. In the cemetery I had to repeat the ceremony of the house, untie the straps, and help carry the feretro to the grave. What this cost me imagines. They lowered the corpse to the grave, brought the lime and the shovel; You know that, you will have gone to more than one funeral, but what you do not know nor could know of any of your friends, reader, or any other stranger, is the crisis that made me when I saw all eyes on me, feet still, and after a few moments of complete silence, a vague whisper, some interrogative voices, signs, and someone, Jose Dias, who said to me in my ear: </p><p>-So talk. </p><p>It was the speech. They wanted the speech. They were entitled to the discourse that was announced. Machinally, I put my hand in my pocket, took out the paper, and read it to the clutches, not all, neither followed nor clear; the voice seemed to come in instead of coming out, my hands trembled. It was not just the new emotion that made me like this, it was the text itself, the memories of the friend, the longing confessed, the praises to the person and his merits; all this I was obliged to say and say evil. At the same time, fearing that they would guess the truth to me, I strove to hide it well. I think few people have listened to me, but the general gesture was one of understanding and approbation. The hands that they gave me to tighten were of solidarity; some said, "Very handsome! very well! Jose Dias thought that eloquence had been in the height of piety. One man, who seemed to me to be a journalist, asked me to take the manuscript and print it. Only my great turbidity would refuse such a simple gift. </p><h2>CXXV - A Comparison</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Priamo judges himself the most unfortunate of men, for kissing the hand of the one who killed his son. Homer reports this, and is a good author, nevertheless he contales it in verse, but there are exact narrations in verse, and even bad verse. Compare you to Priamo's situation with mine; I had just praised the virtues of the man who had received those eyes.... It is impossible that some Homer should not take away from my situation much better, or at least, as such. Do not say that we lack Homeros, for the cause pointed out in Camões; no, sir, they're missing, that's right, but it's because the Prias seek shadow and silence. The tears, if they are, are wiped off the door, so that the faces appear clean and serene; the speeches are rather joy than melancholy, and everything passes as if Achilles did not kill Hector. </p><h2>CXXVI - Scismando</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shortly after leaving the cemetery, I tore the speech and tossed the pieces through the hatch, despite José Dias' efforts to prevent it.</p><p>"It's no use," I said, "and how I might be tempted to print it, it's already destroyed." It's no good, it's not worth anything.</p><p>José Dias demonstrated the opposite at length, then praised the burial, and finally made the panegyros of the dead, a great soul, an active spirit, a right heart, a friend, a good friend, worthy of the most wonderful wife God had given him ...</p><p>At this point of the speech, I let him speak on his own and I began to think with myself. What I scanned was so dark and confusing that it would not let me take my foot. At Cattete I had the car stopped, told Jose Dias to go get the ladies to Flamengo and take them home; I would walk.</p><p>-But...</p><p>I'm going to pay a visit.</p><p>The reason for this was to finish scsmar, and to choose a resolution that suited the moment. The car would move faster than the legs; they would pause or not, they could slow down the pace, stop, shiver, and let their heads feel free. I walked and watched. He had already compared Sancha's gesture to the evening and the despair of that day; were irreconcilable. The widow was really sweet. So the illusion of my vanity faded at all. Would not that be the case with Capitú? I took care of recomposing her eyes, the position in which I saw her, the gathering of people who should of course impose on her the concealment if there was anything to disguise. What here goes by a logical and deductive order, had before been a bundle of ideas and sensations, thanks to the bumps of the car and the interruptions of Jose Dias. Now, however, he reasoned and evoked clearly and well. It concludes from me that it was the old passion that still shook me and made me go wild as always.</p><p>When I reached this final conclusion, I would arrive at the door of the house, but I went back, and went up Cattete Street again. Was it the doubts that afflicted me or the need to afflict Capitú with my great delay? Let us say that they were the two causes; I walked wide, until I felt sorry, and straightened it home. They beat for eight hours in a bakery.</p><h2>CXXVII - The Barber</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Close to home was a barber, who knew me by sight, loved the fiddle, and did not play badly. On the occasion when I was passing, I executed what I did not know. I stopped on the sidewalk and listened to him (everything is pretexts to an agonized heart), he saw me, he continued to play. He did not attend to one of his friends, and soon to another, that there they went, despite the hour and of being Sunday, to entrust the faces to him with the razor. He lost them without losing a note; was playing for me. This consideration made me frankly reach the store door, facing him. In the background, pulling up the calico curtain that closed the interior of the house, I saw a young woman with a dark hair, a light dress, with her hair. She was his wife; I believe you found me from within, and you came to thank me with the presence of the favor I made to your husband. If I'm not mistaken, he came to say it with his eyes. As for her husband, she was now hotter; without seeing the woman, without seeing freguezes, glued the face to the instrument, passed the soul to the bow, and touched, touched ... </p><p>Divine art! A group was forming, I left the store door and walked home; I went down the corridor and up the stairs without a sound. I have never forgotten the case of this barber, or because I am connected to a serious moment of my life, or by this maximum, that the compilers, can get out of here and insert in the school digests. The maximum is that you slowly forget the good deeds you practice, and truly never forget them. Poor barber! lost two beards that night, which were the bread of the next day, all to be heard from a passerby. Suppose now that, instead of leaving, as I was, I stood at the door to hear him and to date his wife; then he, every bow, every fiddle, would play desperately. Divine art! </p><h2>CXXVIII - Handful of Successes</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>As I was saying, I went upstairs without a sound, pushed the cancella, which was just pressed against it, I gave it with cousin Justina and Jose Dias playing cards in the next room. Capitú got up from the settee and came to me. Her face was now serene and pure. The others stopped the game, and we all talked about the disaster and the widow. Capitú censured Escobar's imprudence, and did not hide the sadness that brought his friend's pain. I asked him why he had not been with Sancha that night.</p><p>"There are a lot of people there; I still offered, but I did not. I also told him that it was better to come here, and spend a few days with us here.</p><p>"Did not you?"</p><p>-Neither.</p><p>"But the view of the sea must be painful to you every morning," said Jose Dias, "and I do not know how you can ..."</p><p>-But pass; What's not happening? said Cousin Justina.</p><p>And as around this idea, we began an exchange of words, Capitú left to go and see if the son slept. As she passed the mirror, she arranged her hair so long that it would seem affectionate, if we did not know she was very friendly to herself. When he turned, his eyes were red; he told us that when he looked at his sleeping son he had thought of Sancha's daughter and the affliction of the widow. And without giving her visits, or even seeing if there was a servant, she hugged me and told me that if I wanted to think about her, I had to think about my life first. Jose Dias found the phrase "beautiful," and asked Capitú why he did not make verses. I tried to get the case over, and that was the end of the night.</p><p>The next day I regretted having torn the speech, not that I wanted to print it, but it was the memory of the deceased. I thought about recomposing it, but I only found loose phrases, which once together had no meaning. I also thought about making another, but it was already difficult, and could be caught in false by those who had heard me in the cemetery. As for collecting the little pieces of paper lying in the street, it was late; were already swept away.</p><p>I will invent the souvenirs of Escobar, books, a bronze inkwell, an ivory cane, a bird, the Capitú album, two parishes from Paraná and others. He also possessed them with my hand. We live in this way exchanging memories and gifts, sometimes in years, now for no particular reason. All of this filled my eyes ... The day's news came: they reported on Escobar's disaster and death, his studies and business, personal qualities, business sympathy, and also about the goods left behind, the woman's and daughter. This was all Monday. On Tuesday the testament was opened, which appointed me second executor; the first place was for the woman. He left me nothing, but the words he had written to me in a separate letter were sublime in friendship and esteem. Capitú this time cried a lot; but make up quickly.</p><p>Testament, inventory, everything went almost as fast as it says here. After a short time, Sancha retired to the house of relatives in Paraná.</p><h2>CXXIX - To D. Sancha</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>D. Sancha, I ask you not to read this book; or, if you have read this far, abandon the rest. Just shut it; it will be better to burn him, to give him no temptation, and to april again. If, despite the warning, you want to go to the end, it's your fault; I do not answer for the evil I receive. What he has already done to her, counting the gestures of that sabbath, this is over, since the events, and I with them, deny my illusion; but what is now to be achieved, this is indelible. No, my friend, do not read any more. Go old, without husband or daughter, that I do the same thing, and it is still the best that could be done after the youth. One day, we will go from here to the gate of the sky, where we will find ourselves renewed, like the new plants, Rinovalatte di novelle fronde. The rest in Dante. </p><h2>CXXX - One Day</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Because one day Capitú wanted to know what made me go quiet and bored. And Europe, Mines, Petropolis, a series of dances, a thousand of these remedies advised to the melancholy. I did not know that I would answer; I refused the amusements. As I insisted, I told him that my business was bad. Capitú smiled to cheer me up. And what had to go wrong? They would walk again, and until then the jewels, the objects of some value would be sold, and we would reside in some becco. We would live soggy and forgotten; then we would return to the surface of the water. The tenderness with which he told me this was to move the stones. Well, not like that. I answered curtly that it was not necessary to sell anything. I let myself be silent and bored. Ella proposed me to play cards or checkers, a walking tour, a visit to Matacavallos; and as I did not see anything, he went into the living room, opened the piano, and began to play; I took advantage of the absence, took the hat and left. </p><p>... Excuse me, but this chapter was to be preceded by another, in which I told an incident a few weeks earlier, two months after Sancha's departure. I'll write it down; he could put it before him, before sending the book to the prelate, but it is very difficult to change the number of pages; goes anyway, then the narration will continue right to the end. Moreover, it is short. </p><h2>CXXXI - Before the Previous</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was the case that my life in another time sweet and placid, the bank of the lawyer yielded me enough, Capitú was more beautiful, Ezekiel was growing. The year of 1872 began. </p><p>"Have you noticed that Ezekiel has exquisite expression in his eyes?" Captain asked me. I only saw two people like that, a friend of papae and the deceased Escobar. Look, Ezekiel; he looks steady, so he turns to papa's side, does not have to roll his eyes, like this ... </p><p>It was after dinner; we were still at the table, Capitú played with his son, or he with her, or with one another, because, in truth, they loved each other, but it is also true that he loved me even more. I approached Ezekiel, I thought that Capitú was right; They were Escobar's eyes, but they did not look exquisite to me. After all, there would be only half a dozen expressions in the world, and many similarities would naturally occur. Ezekiel understood nothing, looked at her and me in amazement, and at last jumped into my lap: </p><p>"Let's go for a walk, Papa?" </p><p>-Logo, my son. </p><p>Capitú, oblivious to both, was now staring at the other edge of the table; but I told him that, in the beauty, Ezekiel's eyes were on his mother's side, he smiled shaking his head with an air that I never found in any woman, probably because I did not like the others so much. The people are worth what is worth the affinity of people, and that is where Master Povo took that adage that the ugly loves beautiful hands. Capitú had half a dozen unique gestures on earth. That one entered through my soul within. Thus it is explained that I ran to my wife and friend and filled her face with kisses; but this other incident is not radically necessary to the understanding of the past and future chapter; let us remain in the eyes of Ezekiel. </p><h2>CXXXII - The Beginning and the Details</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Not only the eyes, but the other features, the face, the body, the whole person, were clearing with time. They were like a primitive devil that the artist is filling and coloring gradually, and the figure enters to see, to smile, to palpitate, to speak almost, until the family hangs the picture on the wall, in memory of what was and can not be. Here it could be and it was. The custom was worth much against the effect of the change: but the change was made, not in the manner of theatro, it was made like the morning that points slowly, first that one can read a letter, then read the letter in the street, at home, in the study, without opening the windows; the light from the blinds is enough to distinguish the letters. I read the letter, badly at first and not at all, and then I read better. He would flee, indeed, he would put the paper in his pocket, run the house, shut me, open the windows, close his eyes. When she opened her eyes and the letter again, the letter was clear and the news was very clear.</p><p>Escobar was thus coming from the grave, the seminary, and the Flemish, to sit with me at the table, to receive me on the steps, to kiss me in the study in the morning, or to ask me for the blessing of custom at night. All these actions were repulsive; I tolerated them and practiced them, so that I could not discover myself and the world. But what could conceal the world, could not do it to me, who lived closer to me than anyone. When neither mother nor son were with me, my despair was great, and I swore to kill them both, now suddenly, now slowly, to divide by the time of death all the minutes of the life that is blurred and agonized. But when I returned to the house and saw at the top of the stairs the little creature that wanted and hoped for me, it would have been unarmed and would have differed from day to day.</p><p>What happened between me and Capitú in those dark days, will not be noticed here, for being so small and repeated, and already so late that it can not be said without failure or canceled. But the main will. And the main thing is that our times were now continuous and terrible. Before that evil land of truth was discovered, we had others of little hard; it was not long before the sky turned blue, the sun clear, and the sea on the ground, where again we opened the sails that carried us to the islands and the most beautiful coasts of the universe, until another foot of wind ruined everything, and we, , we waited for another bonanza, which was neither late nor dubia, but total, close and firm.</p><p>Remind me of these metaphors; they smell of the sea and the tide that killed my friend and I burn Escobar. They also smell like Capitú's hangover. So, since I was always a man of the land, I count that part of my life, as a sailor would tell of his shipwreck.</p><p>We had only to say the last word among ourselves; but we read it in the eyes of each other, vibrant and decisive, and whenever Ezekiel came to us he would only separate us. Capitú propoz met him in a collegio, whence he would only come on Saturdays; it cost a lot the boy to accept this situation.</p><p>-I want to go with papae! Papae has to go with me! he cried.</p><p>It was I who took him one morning, a Monday. It was in the old part of Lapa, near our house. I carried him by the hand, as he had taken the coffin of the other. The little boy was crying and asking questions at every step, if he would go home, and when, and if I would go and watch him ...</p><p>-I will.</p><p>-Papae does not go!</p><p>-Yes I will.</p><p>-Jura, papae!</p><p>-Yes, yes.</p><p>"Daddy does not say he swears."</p><p>"I swear."</p><p>And there I took it and left it. The temporary absence did not stop the evil, and all the fine art of Capitú to make him attenuate, at least, it was as if it were not; I felt worse and worse. The same new situation has aggravated my passion. Ezekiel was now living in my sight; but his return, at the end of the weeks, or because of the sloppiness in which I stayed, or because the time was going and completing the resemblance, was the return of Escobar more alive and noisy. Even the voice; before long, it seemed to me the same. On Saturdays he tried not to dine at home and only enter when he was sleeping; but I did not escape Sunday in the study when I found myself between newspapers and cars. Ezekiel came in turbulent, expansive, full of laughter and love, because the demo of the little one every time more died for me. I, to tell you the truth, now felt an aversion that could barely disguise her and others. Not being able to completely cover up this moral disposition, he took care not to make contact with him, or as little as he could; now I had work that forced me to close the office, or else I would go out on Sunday to go for a walk around the city, to get my secret.</p><h2>CXXXIII - An Idea</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>One day, it was a Friday, I could not. One idea, which he denied in me, opened the doors and ran the boats from side to side, as do the ideas that want to leave. To be Friday, I believe, was chance, but it could also have been purposeful; I was brought up in the terror of that day; I listened to ballads at home, coming from the countryside and from the old metropole, on which Friday was the day of omen. However, since there are no almanaks in the brain, it is probable that the idea did not strike the heart except by the need it felt to come to the air and to life. Life is so beautiful that the very idea of ​​death needs to come first to it before it is fulfilled. You understand me already; read another chapter now. </p><h2>CXXXIV - Saturday</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>The idea finally came out of the brain. It was night, and I could not sleep, no matter how hard it shook me. Also no night passed me so short. It dawned, when he took care not to be more than an hour or two. Sai, supposing to leave the idea at home; she came with me Here it was the same dark color, the same trembling azes, and as it flew with them, it was as if it were fixed; I carried it in the retina, not that I covered the external things, but I saw them through it, with the color more pale than usual, and without delay. </p><p>Does not remind me well the rest of the day. I know that I have written some letters, I have bought a substance, which I do not say, so as not to have the desire to procreate it. The pharmacy failed, it's true; the owner became a banker, and the bank prospered. When I found death in my pocket, I felt as much joy as if I had just gotten the big lot, or even greater, because the prize of the lottery is spent, and death is not wasted. I went to my mother's house, in order to say goodbye, as a visit. Either by truth or by illusion, everything there seemed to me better on that day, my mother less sad, Uncle Cosme forgotten of the heart, cousin Justina of the tongue. I spent an hour in peace. I even gave up the project. What was needed to live? Never leave that house again, or hold that hour to myself ... </p><h2>CXXXV - Othello</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I had dinner. At night I went to the theater. It was Othello, whom I had neither seen nor ever read; I only knew the subject, and I esteemed the coincidence. I saw the great rages of the Moor, because of a handkerchief, -a simple handkerchief! -and here I give substance to the psychologists of this and other continents, for I could not steal from the observation that a handkerchief sufficed to inflame the jealousies of Othello and compose the most sublime tragedy of this world. The handkerchiefs were lost, today their own sheets are needed; There are not even any ha, and they're only worth the shirts. These were the ideas that passed through my head, vague and murky, as the Moor rolled convulsively, and Iago distilled his slander. I did not get up from the chair in the intervallos; I did not want to expose myself to finding someone I knew. The ladies stayed almost all in the cabins, while the men went smoking. Then I wondered if any of them would not have loved someone who was now in the cemetery, and there were other inconsistencies, until the cloth went up and continued the play. The last act showed me that not I, but Capitú should die. I heard Desdemona's supplications, her pure and amorous words, and the fury of the Moor, and the death he gave her in the midst of the public applause. </p><p>And she was innocent, I was coming down the street, what would the public do, if she were guilty, as guilty as Capitú? And what death would the Moor give him? A pillow would not suffice; it took blood and fire, an intense and vast fire, that consumed everything, and reduced it to dust, and the dust would be thrown into the wind, like an eternal extinction ... </p><p> I wandered the streets the rest of the night. Geez, that's right, a quasi nothing, but enough to go until morning. I saw the last hours of the night and the first of the day, I saw the last walkers and the first sweepers, the first carts, the first noises, the first dawns, one day after another and I would see myself never to return. The streets that I walked like that ran away on their own. He would never again contemplate the Sea of ​​Glory, nor the mountain of the Organs, nor the fortress of Santa Cruz and the others. The people who passed were not so much, as in the ordinary days of the week, but she was already numerous and went to some work, which she would repeat later; I would not repeat anything else. </p><p>I got home, opened the door slowly, climbed to my feet, and went into the study; It was going to take six hours. I took the venom out of my pocket, got into my shirt sleeves, and wrote a letter, the last, addressed to Capitú. None of the others was for her; I felt the need to tell him a word in which I should feel the remorse of my death. I wrote two texts. The first one I burned it for being long and diffuse. The second contained only the necessary, clear and brief. It reminded him of our past, neither of the struggles, nor of any joy; he told him only of Escobar and the need to die. </p><h2>CXXXVI - The Coffee Bean</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>My plan was to wait for the coffee, to dissolve it in the drug and ingeril-a. Until then, having not forgotten all my Roman history, he reminded me that Cato, before he killed himself, read and reread a book by Plato. Plato did not have me; but a truncated tome of Plutarch, in which the life of the celebrated Roman was narrated, it was enough for me to occupy that little time, and, in order to imitate him, I stretched out on the couch. Nor was it only imitating him in this; he had need of instilling in me the courage of him, just as he needed the sentiments of the philosopher, intrepidly to die. One of the evils of ignorance is not having this remedy at the last minute. There are many people who kill without it, and it nobly expires; but I am sure that many more people would put an end to their days if they could find this kind of moral cocaine from good books. Meanwhile, wanting to escape any suspicion of imitation, it reminds me well that, in order not to be found the book of Plutarch at my feet, nor to be given the news in the gazettes with the color of the trousers that I then wore, -O again in your log, before drinking the poison. </p><p>The waiter brought the coffee. I got up, put away the book, and went to the table where the chicara had been. The house was already rumored; It was time to break up with me. My hand shook as I opened the wrapping paper. Still I had the courage to pour the substance into the chicha, and I began to stir the coffee, the vague eyes, the memory in innocent Desdemona; the spectacle of the evening had come to interfere with the reality of the morning. But the photograph of Escobar gave me the courage I lacked; there he was, with his hand on the back of the chair, looking away ... </p><p>"Let's get on with it, I thought. </p><p>When I went to drink, I wondered if it would not be better to wait for Capitú and his son to go to mass; he would drink later; it was better. So arranged, I went for a walk in the study. I heard the voice of Ezekiel in the hall, and I saw him come in and run to me, crying out, </p><p>-Papae! papae </p><p>Reader, here was a gesture that I do not describe as havel-o entirely forgotten, but believe it was beautiful and tragic. Effectively, the figure of the little one made me back down until I turned my back on the shelf. Ezequiel put his arms around my knees, stretched out on tiptoe, as if to climb up and give me the usual kiss; and he repeated, pulling me: </p><p>-Papae! papae </p><h2>CXXXVII - The Second Impulse</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>If I did not look at Ezekiel, it is probable that I was not here writing this book, because my first impulse was to run to coffee and drink it. I picked up the chicha, but the little one kissed my hand as usual, and the sight of him, like the gesture, gave me another impulse that I can hardly say here; but go there, tell yourself everything. Call me a murderer; it will not be me that disdains or contradicts them; my second impulse was criminal. I leaned over and asked Ezekiel if he had already had coffee. </p><p>"Already, papae; I'm going to Mass with Mom. </p><p>"Have another chicha, half chicha only. </p><p>"And Papa?" </p><p>"I'll send more; Come on, baby! </p><p>Ezekiel opened his mouth. I came to the chicara, so shaken that I almost tucked it in, but willing to make her fall down the wrist, if the taste disgusted her, or the temperature, because the coffee was cold ... But I do not know that I felt that made me back off. Puz had hit her on the table, and I found myself kissing the boy's head doubtfully. </p><p>-Papae papae! exclaimed Ezekiel. </p><p>"No, no, I'm not your father!" </p><h2>CXXXVIII - Capitu Enters</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>When I raised my head, I found the figure of Capitú before me. Here is another story, which will appear as theatrical, and is as natural as the first, since the mother and the son went to mass, and Capitú did not leave without speaking to me. It was already a brief and short speech; most of the time, I did not even look at her. Ella was always looking, waiting.</p><p>This time, when I met her, I do not know if it was from my eyes, but Capitú seemed livid. There followed one of those silences, which, without lying, could be called a century, such is the extension of time in great crises. Capitú recomposed himself; told his son to go away, and asked me to explain ...</p><p>"No need to explain," I said.</p><p>"There is everything; I do not understand your tears nor those of Ezekiel. What happened between you?</p><p>"Did not you hear what I said?"</p><p>Capitú replied that he had heard crying and rumor of words. I believe that I had heard everything clearly, but confessing it would be to lose hope of silence and reconciliation; so he denied the hearing and only confirmed the hearing. Without telling him the episode of coffee, I repeated the words at the end of the chapter.</p><p>-What? she asked as if she'd heard it badly.</p><p>"That he is not my son."</p><p>Great was the amazement of Captain, and not less the indignation that succeeded him, so natural both that would doubt the first witnesses of our view. I have heard that ha ha for several cases, a price issue; I do not believe it, especially since the person who told me this had just lost a suit. But whether or not there were rented witnesses, mine was true; nature itself swore by itself, and I did not want to doubt it. So that, without paying any attention to the language of Capitú, to his gestures, to the fact that the twisting, nothing, I repeated the words spoken twice with such resolution that made it slack. After a few moments she said to me:</p><p>"Only such insult could be explained by sincere conviction; however, you who were so jealous of the smallest gestures, never revealed the slightest shadow of mistrust. What gave you such an idea? Say, "he continued, seeing that I did not answer anything," tell me everything; after what I've heard, I can hear the rest, it can not be much. What gave you such conviction now? Come on, Bentinho, speak! speak! Leave me here, but say it all first.</p><p>"There are things that are not said.</p><p>"That they do not say only half; but since I said half, say it all.</p><p>He had sat in a chair at the foot of the table. She could be a little confused, the postage was not accused. I asked him once again not to be stubborn.</p><p>"No, Bentinho, or tell the rest, so that I defend myself, if you think I have a defense, or I ask you for our separation from now on: I can not!</p><p>"The separation is a decided thing, I'll pick you up on the proposal." We had better do it in half words or in silence; each one would go with his wound. Once, however, you insist, here is what I can tell you, and that is all.</p><p>I did not say it all; I could scarcely allude to Escobar's affections without uttering his name. Capitú could not stop laughing, a laugh that I feel I can not transcribe here; then, in an ironic and melancholic tone:</p><p>"Even the dead!" Even the dead do not escape their jealousy!</p><p>He fixed his hood and stood up. She sighed, I think she sighed, while I, who asked for nothing more than the full justification of it, told her I do not know what words fit for this purpose. Capitú looked at me with disdain, and murmured:</p><p>"I know the reason for this; it is the coincidence of resemblance ... The will of God will explain everything ... Laugh? It's natural; despite the seminary, does not believe in God; I believe ... But let's not talk about it; It's not good for us to say anything else.</p><h2>CXXXIX - A Photograph</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was a word that I had been quick to believe that I was the victim of a great illusion, a phantasmagoria of allucinado; but the sudden entrance of Ezekiel, shouting, "Mama! mom! it's time for mass! "he restored me to the consciousness of reality. Capitú and I, involuntarily, looked at the photograph of Escobar, and then at each other. This time the confusion of it became pure confession. This was that one; there was by force some small Escobar photograph that would be our little Ezekiel. But he did not confess anything; repeated the last words, pulled his son and left for Mass. </p><h2>CXL - Back from the Church</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Being alone, it was natural to get coffee and drink it. Well, no, sir; he had lost his taste for death. Death was a solution; I had just found another, so much better that it was not definitive, and left the door open for repair, if I should havel it. I did not say forgiveness, but reparation, that is, justice. Whatever the reason for the act, I rejected death, and awaited the return of Capitú. This was more time consuming than usual; I came to fear that she had gone to my mother's house, but she did not go.</p><p>"I entrusted all my bitterness to God," said Capitú, as he returned from the church. I heard within me that our separation is indispensable, and I am at your command.</p><p>The eyes with which he told me this were stunned, as if watching for a gesture of refusal or waiting. I counted on my weakness or the uncertainty in which I might be of the other's paternity, but it failed. Was there a new man in me, a man who appeared now, since new and strong impressions have discovered him? In that case he was a man just covered up. I told him I was going to think, and we would do as I thought. Verily I say unto you, All things were thought and done.</p><p>In the interval, he had evoked the words of the late Gurgel, when he showed me in his house the portrait of the woman, similar to Capitú. You must remember them; if not, re-read the chapter, whose number I do not put here, because I do not remember what it is, but it is not far. They reduced themselves to saying that there were such inexplicable similarities... On the day before, and on other days, Ezekiel would go with me to the study, and the features of the little one gave a clear idea of ​​the other, or I would give more attention to them. Involved, they reminded me of vague and remote episodes, words, meetings and incidents, all of which my blindness was not malicious, and which my old jealousy lacked. Once I found them alone and silent, a secret that made me laugh, a word like dreaming, all those reminiscences came now, in such an outrage that they stunned me ... And because I did not discount them one day, when I street eyes where two swallows were on the telegraph wire? Inside, my other swallows were up in the air, eyes stuck in their eyes, but so cautious that they were out of control at once, telling me a friendly and cheerful word. I told them the story of the swallows, and found it amusing; Escobar declared that for him it would be better if the swallows, instead of climbing on the wire, were sewed at the dinner table. "I have never eaten their nests," he went on, "but they must be good if the Chinese invented them." And we were dealing with the Chinese and the classics who spoke of them, while Capitú, confessing that we annoyed her, went to other care. Now it reminded me of everything that seemed nothing to me then.</p><h2>CXLI - The Solution</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Here's what we did. We took ourselves and went to Europe, not to walk, to see anything, new or old; We stopped in Switzerland. A teacher from Rio Grande, who was with us, stayed with Capitú, teaching the mother tongue to Ezekiel, who would apprentice the rest in the country's schools. Thus regulated life, I returned to Brazil. </p><p>After a few months, Capitú had begun to write me letters, to which I responded briefly and dryly. The della were submissive, without hatred, perhaps affectionate, and to the end homesick; he asked me to see her. I embarked a year later, but I did not look for it, and repeated the trip with the same result. On the way back, those who remembered it, wanted news, and I gave it to them, as if I had just lived with it; of course the trips were made with the intention of simulating this very thing, and to deceive the opinion. One day, finally ... </p><h2>CXLII - A Saint</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>It should be understood that if in the journeys I made to Europe, Jose Dias was not with me, it was not that he lacked his will; Uncle Cosme was almost unfit, and my mother, who got old quickly. He was also old, though he was stiff. He was going to take his leave of me on board, and the words he said to me, the gestures of the handkerchief, the very eyes he wiped were so touching me. The last time was not the board.</p><p>- Come on ...</p><p>-I can not.</p><p>-Is afraid?</p><p>-No; I can not. Now, farewell, Bentinho, I do not know if he will see me any more; I believe that I am going to the other Europe, the eternal ...</p><p>It was not soon; My mother boarded first. Search in the cemetery of St. John the Baptist an unnamed grave, with this unique indication: A saint. It's there. I made this inscription with some difficulty. The sculptor found it exquisite; the administrator of the cemetery consulted the vicar of parochia; this one pondered to me that the saints are in the altar and in the sky.</p><p>"But, pardon, I said, I do not want to say that there is a canon in that grave. My idea is to give with such a word an earthly definition of all the virtues that the deceased possessed in life. So much so, that modesty being one of them, I wish to preserve it postuma, not by writing the name.</p><p>-Yet, the name, affiliation, dates ...</p><p>"Who cares about dates, filiation, or names, after I'm done?"</p><p>"You mean she was a holy lady, did not you?"</p><p>"Right. The protonotario Cabral, if he were alive, would confirm what I say here.</p><p>I do not answer the truth, I hesitate only in the formula. Did you know the protonotary?</p><p>-I met. He was a model priest.</p><p>"Good canonist, good Latinist, pious and charitable," continued the vicar.</p><p>"And I had some society gifts," I said; there at home I always heard that he was an insigne partner to backgammon ...</p><p>-He had very good data! sighed the vicar slowly. A master die!</p><p>"So, you think ...?"</p><p>"Since there is no other sense, nor could you do it, yes, sir, admit it-"</p><p>José Dias attended these proceedings, with great melancholy. In the end, when we left, he said ill of the priest, he called him meticulous. I only felt sorry for not having met my mother, neither he nor the other men in the cemetery.</p><p>"They did not know her; if they knew her, they would have the most holy carved.</p><h2>CXLIII - The Last Superlative</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was not the last superlative of Jose Dias. Others had it not worth writing here, until he saw the last one, the best of them, the sweetest, which made him a death piece of life. I used to live with him; although my mother left him a small memory, he came to tell me that, with or without a legacy, he would not leave me. Maybe his hope was to bury me. He corresponded with Capitú, to whom he asked to send him the portrait of Ezekiel; but Capitú was postponing the mail-to-mail despatch until he asked for nothing but the young student's heart; he also asked him not to cease to speak to Ezekiel in the old friend of the father and grandfather, "destined for heaven to love the same blood." This was how he prepared the care of the third generation; but death came before Ezekiel. The disease was rapid. I sent for a homeopathic doctor. </p><p>"No, Bentinho," he said. an allopatha is enough; in every school one dies. Again, it was the ideas of youth, which time took; I become the faith of my parents. Allopathia is the Catholicism of medicine ... He died peacefully after a short agony. Shortly before he heard that the sky was beautiful, he asked us to open the window. </p><p>"No, the air could do you harm." </p><p>"How bad?" Air is life. </p><p>We open the window. Actually, there was a clear blue sky. Jose Dias stood up and looked at him; after a few moments, he dropped his head, murmuring: Lindissimo! It was the last word he uttered in this world. Poor José Dias! Why should I deny that I cried for him? </p><h2>CXLIV - A Late Question</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>So weep for me all the eyes of friends and friends that I leave in this world, but it is not probable. I've made myself forget. Far away and I leave little. It is not that he has effectively connected the two ends of life. This house of the Engenho Novo, while reproducing that of Matacavallos, only reminds me of that one, and more by comparison and reflection than of feeling. I already said that. </p><p>They will ask me why, having their own old house on the same old street, I did not stop them from demolishing it and I came to reproduce it in this one. The question should have been asked at first, but here is the answer. The reason is that as soon as my mother died, wanting to go there, I first made a long inspection visit for a few days, and the whole house did not know me. In the yard, the mason and the pitangueira, the well, the old bucket and the washing machine, knew nothing about me. The casuarina was the same one I had left in the background, but the trunk, instead of straight, as an old one, now had a question mark air; naturally he was amazed by the intruder. I ran my eyes through the air, searching for some thought left there, and found none. On the contrary, the branch began to whisper something that I did not understand soon, and it seems that it was the song of the new mornings. At the foot of this sonorous and jovial music, I also heard the grunting of pigs, a sort of concentrated mockery and philosophical. </p><p>Everything was strange and adverse to me. I let them demolish the house, and later, when I came to the New Mill, he reminded me to make this reproduction for explanations that I gave to the architecto as I counted in time. </p><h2>CXLV - The Return</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Now it was already in this house that one day, when I was getting dressed for lunch, I received a card with this name:</p><p>EZEQUIEL A. OF SANTIAGO class = "center"</p><p>- Is the person there? I asked the servant.</p><p>-Yes sir; waited.</p><p>I did not go soon; I fil-o wait a ten or fifteen minutes in the room. It was only later that he reminded me that I was going to have a little fuss and run, hug him, talk to his mother. The mother, I believe she has not yet said that she was dead and buried. Was; there lies in old Switzerland. I just got dressed in a hurry. When I left the room, I took ares de pae, a pae between meek and curly, half Dom Casmurro. As I entered the room, I found a young man with his back to the wall of Massinissa's bust. I came cautious, and I made no sound. Nevertheless, he heard my footsteps, and turned quickly. He knew me by the pictures and ran to me. I did not move; was no more and no less my old and young companion of the Seminary of St Joseph, a little lower, less full of body, and save the colors that were alive, the same face of my friend. It was modern, of course, and the manners were different, but the general aspect reproduced the dead person. It was his own, the exact one, the real Escobar. It was my battle; was his father's son. He dressed in mourning for his mother; I was in black too. We sat down.</p><p>"Papa does not differ from the last pictures," he told me.</p><p>The voice was the same as that of Escobar, the accent was ardent. I explained that I really did not really differ from what it was, and I began an interrogation to have less to speak and thus dominate my emotion. But this even excited the face of him, and my colleague of the seminary was resurfacing more and more of the cemetery. Here I stand, before me, with equal laughter and greater respect; total, the same gift and the same grace. He longed to see me. The mother spoke highly of me, praising me extraordinarily, as the purest man in the world, the most worthy of being loved.</p><p>"She was beautiful," he concluded.</p><p>-Let's have lunch.</p><p>If you think the lunch was bitter, you fool yourself. Had his minutes of annoyance, it's true; at first it hurt me that Ezekiel was not really my son, that I did not complete and continue. If the boy had gone to his mother, I would have come to believe it all, much more easily than he seemed to have left me on the eve of the evening, evoking childhood, scenes and words, going to college ...</p><p>"Papa still remembers when you took me to college?" he asked, laughing.</p><p>"Shall I not remember?"</p><p>"It was in Lapa; I was desperate, and Papa would not stop, he would give me every tug, and I with my little legs .... Yes, sir, I accept.</p><p>He held out the glass to the wine I offered him, drank a sip, and continued to eat. Escobar ate like that too, his face on his plate. He told me about life in Europe, his studies, particularly those of archeology, which was his passion. He spoke of antiquity with love, counted Egypto and his thousands of centuries, without losing himself in the figures; He had the father's arithmetical head. I, since the idea of ​​the fatherhood of the other was already familiar to me, did not like the resurrection. Sometimes he would shut his eyes to see no gestures or anything, but the goblin spoke and laughed, and the dead man spoke and laughed at him.</p><p>If there was no remedy other than to stay with him, I made myself truly pae. The idea that he might have seen some photograph of Escobar, which Captain Carelessly took with him, did not come to me, nor, if he did, would he persist. Ezekiel believes in me as in the mother. If Jose Dias were alive, I would find him in my own person. Justina wanted to see him, but being ill, she asked me to take him there. I knew that kinswoman. I believe that the desire to see Ezekiel was for the purpose of verifying in the young man the bond that he might have found in the boy. It would be a last gift; I caught him in time.</p><p>"It is very bad," I said to Ezekiel that he wanted to go there, any emotion could bring him to death. We'll go there when it gets better.</p><p>We were not; death took her within a few days. She falls in the Lord or whatever it is. Ezekiel saw his face in the coffin and did not know it, nor could he, so did the years and death. On the way to the cemetery, they remembered a lot of things, some street, some tower, a stretch of beach, and it was all joy. This was the way he always went home at the end of the day; he told me the memories he was receiving from the streets and houses. Many of them were astonished to be the same as he had left, as if the houses were killing girls.</p><p>At the end of six months, Ezekiel spoke to me on a trip to Greece, to Egypt, and to Palestine, a scientific journey, a promise made to some friends. </p><p>"What sex?" I asked laughing. </p><p>He smiled in annoyance and told me that women were such fashionable and day-old creatures who would never understand a ruin of thirty centuries. They were two college colleges. I gave him resources, and I gave him the exact first money. Commigo said that one of the consequences of the father's stealthy love was to pay for his son's archeology; I was so cruel and perverse that I took the boy and tried to open it to his heart, but I drew back; I looked at him afterwards, as one does to a real son; The eyes he laid on me were tender and grateful. </p><h2>CXLVI - There Was No Leprosy</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>There was no leprosy, but there were fevers for all these human lands, whether old or new. Eleven months later, Ezekiel died of a typhoid fever, and was buried in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem, where the two friends of the university raised a tomb to him with this inscription, taken from the prophet Ezekiel, in Greek: "You were perfect in your ways." They sent me both the Greek and Latin texts, the drawing of the grave, the expense account and the rest of the money he was carrying; he would pay three times as much to keep it off. </p><p>As I wanted to check the text, I consulted my Vulgate, and I thought it was accurate, but it still had a complement: "You were perfect in your ways from the day of your creation." I stopped and asked quietly, "When would it be the creation of Ezekiel? "No one answered me. Here is another mysterio to gather the many of this world. After all, I drank well and went to the theater. </p><h2>CXLVII - Retrospective</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>You know that my soul, however lacerated it may have been, did not stand there in a corner like a lonely, livid flower. I did not give it that color or it did not. I lived the best I could, without lacking friends to console me at first. Caprices of little hard, it's true. They left me as people who attend a retrospective exhibition, and either get enough of it, or the light of the room fades. One of these visits had a car at the door and a charioteer of livery. The others went modestly, and asked me if it was raining, and it was raining, I was going to get a car from the square, and put them inside, with great farewells, and great recommendations: </p><p>-Do you read the catalog? </p><p>-It; see you tomorrow. </p><p>-See you tomorrow. </p><p>They were not coming back. I stood at the door, waiting, went to the corner, peeped, consulted the clock, and saw nothing or anyone. Then, if there was another visitor, he would give her his arm, we would go in, show him the paizagens, the historical or genre paintings, an aquarella, a pastel, a gouache, and also it would fall, and leave with the catalog in hand .... </p><h2>CXLVIII - Well, What About the Rest?</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Now, why did none of these capricious things make me forget the first love of my heart? Maybe because none of the eyes had a hangover, or those of a gypsy obliqued and disguised. But this is not the rest of the book itself. The rest is whether the Capitú of Gloria beach was already inside the one of Matacavallos, or if this one was changed in that by the effect of some incident case. Jesus, son of Sirach, if he knew of my first jealousy, he would tell me, as in his chap. IX, vers. 1: "Do not be jealous of your wife so that she does not try to deceive you with the malice she feels about you." But I do not think so, and you will agree with me; if you remember Capitúch well, you must recognize that one was inside the other, like the fruit inside the shell. </p><p>And, whatever the solution, one thing remains, and it's the summa of the summa, or the rest of the remains, namely that my first friend and my best friend, so extreme both of them and so dear also, destiny that they would come together and deceive me .... The earth is light to them! Let's go to History of the suburbs. </p><p>THE END. </p>

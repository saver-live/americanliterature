<p>(To YÃ¼an)<br> Remember how Tung built us a place to drink in<br> At Lo-yang south of the T'ien-ching bridge?<br> White jade and gold bought songs and laughter.<br> We drank forgetting Court and princes.<br> Those amongst us, wisest and bravest<br> On all this side of rivers and oceans,<br> Hearts high as clouds, and you and I together,<br> Cared nothing at crossing lakes and mountains<br> Only to share our thoughts and feelings.<br> <br> Then I went out south-east to cut the laurel, <br> You north of Lo River still lost in dreams.<br> No joy in being parted. Soon back again in mountains,<br> Tracking the thirty-six twists and turns of valley,<br> By the streams bright with a thousand flowers,<br> By endless waters,<br> Hearing pine-trees sighing,<br> Till we met the Hang-tung Governor<br> On a gold and silver saddle,<br> And Hu the True-Taoist drew us with his pipe playing,<br> Making unearthly music out of the high tower,<br> Strange sounds of the mating phoenix.<br> The Governor's sleeves kept time to the music,<br> So that he rose, drunk, and danced a little,<br> Brought his brocade coat, covered my body.<br> I fell asleep, head resting in his lap.<br> By day our hearts rose to the nine heavens.<br> At evening we scattered like blown stars or rain,<br> I to my far mountain over hills and waters,<br> You to your own house by the bridge of Wei.<br> <br> That winter I made your father's North City,<br> Loved you for the way you did me honour,<br> Sharing your wealth, thinking nothing of it.<br> Wine there - in cups of amber,<br> Food there - on plates of jade.<br> I ate and drank, no thoughts of returning.<br> We went out to the west. The river parts there,<br> Round the ancient shrine of a Prince of Chou.<br> Boats on the waters to drums and piping.<br> Waves made of dragon scales. Jade-green rushes.<br> We drank and drank, lived the passing moments,<br> Forgetting how they go like blossoms or snowfall. <br> Flushed with wine, warm in glow of sunset,<br> The hundred-foot deep pool mirroring bright faces,<br> Dancing-girls delicate as willows in the moonlight,<br> Notes lost in the silken sleeves' fluttering.<br> A white breeze blew their song to the sky,<br> Winding through the air, twisting in the cloud-lanes.<br> Never again. Never again such joy.<br> <br> I went west but got no promotion.<br> White-headed back to eastern hills.<br> Met once more south of Wei's bridge.<br> Parted again north of Tso's terrace.<br> And if you ask my feelings at parting,<br> They were inside me like Spring flowers falling.<br> No way to say what's in the heart. Never.<br> I call in the boy. Have him kneel here, tie this,<br> To send my feelings through a thousand miles. <br></p>

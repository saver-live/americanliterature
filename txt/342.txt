<p>OFT, in the silence of the night,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lonely moon rides high,<br> When wintry winds are whistling,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we hear the owl's shrill cry,<br> In the quiet, dusky chamber,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the flickering firelight,<br> Rising up between two sleepers,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes a spirit all in white.<br> <br> A winsome little ghost it is,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosy-cheeked, and bright of eye;<br> With yellow curls all breaking loose<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the small cap pushed awry.<br> Up it climbs among the pillows,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "big dark" brings no dread,<br> And a baby's boundless fancy<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes a kingdom of a bed.<br> <br> A fearless little ghost it is;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe the night seems as the day;<br> The moon is but a gentle face,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sighing winds are gay.<br> The solitude is full of friends,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hour brings no regrets;<br> For, in this happy little soul,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines a sun that never sets.<br> <br> A merry little ghost it is,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dancing gayly by itself,<br> On the flowery counterpane,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a tricksy household elf;<br> Nodding to the fitful shadows,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they flicker on the wall;<br> Talking to familiar pictures,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mimicking the owl's shrill call.<br> <br> A thoughtful little ghost if is;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when lonely gambols tire,<br> With chubby hands on chubby knees,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sits winking at the fire.<br> Fancies innocent and lovely<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shine before those baby-eyes, --<br> Endless fields of dandelions,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooks, and birds, and butterflies.<br> <br> A loving little ghost it is:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When crept into its nest,<br> Its hand on father's shoulder laid,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its head on mother's breast,<br> It watches each familiar face,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a tranquil, trusting eye;<br> And, like a sleepy little bird,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sings its own soft lullaby.<br> <br> Then those who feigned to sleep before,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest baby play till dawn,<br> Wake and watch their folded flower --<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little rose without a thorn.<br> And, in the silence of the night,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearts that love it most<br> Pray tenderly above its sleep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God bless our little ghost!"</p>

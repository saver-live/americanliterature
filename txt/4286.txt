<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Isabel, poor simple Isabel!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo, a young palmer in Loves eye!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could not in the self-same mansion dwell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without some stir of heart, some malady;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could not sit at meals but feel how well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It soothed each to be the other by;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could not, sure, beneath the same roof sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to each other dream, and nightly weep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With every morn their love grew tenderer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With every eve deeper and tenderer still;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might not in house, field, or garden stir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her full shape would all his seeing fill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his continual voice was pleasanter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her, than noise of trees or hidden rill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lute-string gave an echo of his name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew whose gentle hand was at the latch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the door had given her to his eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from her chamber-window he would catch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her beauty farther than the falcon spies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And constant as her vespers would he watch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because her face was turnd to the same skies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with sick longing all the night outwear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear her morning-step upon the stair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole long month of May in this sad plight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made their cheeks paler by the break of June:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To morrow will I bow to my delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow will I ask my ladys boon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O may I never see another night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo, if thy lips breathe not loves tune.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake they to their pillows; but, alas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honeyless days and days did he let pass;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until sweet Isabellas untouchd cheek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell sick within the roses just domain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell thin as a young mothers, who doth seek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By every lull to cool her infants pain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How ill she is, said he, I may not speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I will, and tell my love all plain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If looks speak love-laws, I will drink her tears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the least twill startle off her cares.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said he one fair morning, and all day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart beat awfully against his side;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to his heart he inwardly did pray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For power to speak; but still the ruddy tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stifled his voice, and pulsd resolve away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feverd his high conceit of such a bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet brought him to the meekness of a child:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! when passion is both meek and wild!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So once more he had wakd and anguished
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dreary night of love and misery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Isabels quick eye had not been wed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To every symbol on his forehead high;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw it waxing very pale and dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight all flushd; so, lisped tenderly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo! here she ceasd her timid quest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in her tone and look he read the rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Isabella, I can half perceive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may speak my grief into thine ear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou didst ever any thing believe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe how I love thee, believe how near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul is to its doom: I would not grieve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy hand by unwelcome pressing, would not fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine eyes by gazing; but I cannot live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another night, and not my passion shrive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love! thou art leading me from wintry cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady! thou leadest me to summer clime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I must taste the blossoms that unfold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its ripe warmth this gracious morning time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said, his erewhile timid lips grew bold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poesied with hers in dewy rhyme:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great bliss was with them, and great happiness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew, like a lusty flower in Junes caress.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parting they seemd to tread upon the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twin roses by the zephyr blown apart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to meet again more close, and share
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inward fragrance of each others heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, to her chamber gone, a ditty fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang, of delicious love and honeyd dart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He with light steps went up a western hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade the sun farewell, and joyd his fill.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All close they met again, before the dusk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All close they met, all eves, before the dusk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close in a bower of hyacinth and musk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown of any, free from whispering tale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! better had it been for ever so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than idle ears should pleasure in their woe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were they unhappy then? It cannot be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too many tears for lovers have been shed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too many sighs give we to them in fee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much of pity after they are dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too many doleful stories do we see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose matter in bright gold were best be read;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in such a page where Theseus spouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the pathless waves towards him bows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, for the general award of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little sweet doth kill much bitterness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Dido silent is in under-grove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Isabellas was a great distress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though young Lorenzo in warm Indian clove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not embalmd, this truth is not the less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even bees, the little almsmen of spring-bowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know there is richest juice in poison-flowers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her two brothers this fair lady dwelt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enriched from ancestral merchandize,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for them many a weary hand did swelt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In torched mines and noisy factories,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many once proud-quiverd loins did melt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In blood from stinging whip; with hollow eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many all day in dazzling river stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the rich-ored driftings of the flood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them the Ceylon diver held his breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went all naked to the hungry shark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them his ears gushd blood; for them in death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal on the cold ice with piteous bark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay full of darts; for them alone did seethe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand men in troubles wide and dark:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-ignorant, they turnd an easy wheel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That set sharp racks at work, to pinch and peel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were they proud? Because their marble founts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gushd with more pride than do a wretchs tears?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were they proud? Because fair orange-mounts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were of more soft ascent than lazar stairs?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were they proud? Because red-lind accounts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were richer than the songs of Grecian years?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were they proud? again we ask aloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why in the name of Glory were they proud?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet were these Florentines as self-retired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hungry pride and gainful cowardice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As two close Hebrews in that land inspired,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paled in and vineyarded from beggar-spies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawks of ship-mast forests the untired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pannierd mules for ducats and old lies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick cats-paws on the generous stray-away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great wits in Spanish, Tuscan, and Malay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was it these same ledger-men could spy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Isabella in her downy nest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could they find out in Lorenzos eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A straying from his toil? Hot Egypts pest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into their vision covetous and sly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could these money-bags see east and west?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet so they did and every dealer fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must see behind, as doth the hunted hare.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O eloquent and famed Boccaccio!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thee we now should ask forgiving boon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of thy spicy myrtles as they blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of thy roses amorous of the moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of thy lilies, that do paler grow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they can no more hear thy ghitterns tune,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For venturing syllables that ill beseem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet glooms of such a piteous theme.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant thou a pardon here, and then the tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall move on soberly, as it is meet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other crime, no mad assail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make old prose in modern rhyme more sweet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is done succeed the verse or fail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To honour thee, and thy gone spirit greet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stead thee as a verse in English tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An echo of thee in the north-wind sung.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These brethren having found by many signs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What love Lorenzo for their sister had,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how she lovd him too, each unconfines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bitter thoughts to other, well nigh mad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he, the servant of their trade designs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should in their sisters love be blithe and glad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When twas their plan to coax her by degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some high noble and his olive-trees.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a jealous conference had they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many times they bit their lips alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they fixd upon a surest way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the youngster for his crime atone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the last, these men of cruel clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut Mercy with a sharp knife to the bone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they resolved in some forest dim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kill Lorenzo, and there bury him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on a pleasant morning, as he leant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the sun-rise, oer the balustrade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the garden-terrace, towards him they bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their footing through the dews; and to him said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem there in the quiet of content,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo, and we are most loth to invade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm speculation; but if you are wise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bestride your steed while cold is in the skies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day we purpose, ay, this hour we mount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spur three leagues towards the Apennine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come down, we pray thee, ere the hot sun count
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dewy rosary on the eglantine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo, courteously as he was wont,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowd a fair greeting to these serpents whine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went in haste, to get in readiness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With belt, and spur, and bracing huntsmans dress.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he to the court-yard passd along,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each third step did he pause, and listend oft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he could hear his ladys matin-song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the light whisper of her footstep soft;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he thus over his passion hung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard a laugh full musical aloft;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, looking up, he saw her features bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile through an in-door lattice, all delight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, Isabel! said he, I was in pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest I should miss to bid thee a good morrow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! what if I should lose thee, when so fain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am to stifle all the heavy sorrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a poor three hours absence? but well gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the amorous dark what day doth borrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good bye! Ill soon be back. Good bye! said she:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he went she chanted merrily.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the two brothers and their murderd man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode past fair Florence, to where Arnos stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurgles through straitend banks, and still doth fan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itself with dancing bulrush, and the bream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps head against the freshets. Sick and wan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brothers faces in the ford did seem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzos flush with love. They passd the water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a forest quiet for the slaughter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was Lorenzo slain and buried in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in that forest did his great love cease;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! when a soul doth thus its freedom win,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It aches in loneliness is ill at peace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the break-covert blood-hounds of such sin:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dippd their swords in the water, and did tease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their horses homeward, with convulsed spur,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each richer by his being a murderer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told their sister how, with sudden speed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo had taen ship for foreign lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of some great urgency and need
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their affairs, requiring trusty hands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Girl! put on thy stifling widows weed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scape at once from Hopes accursed bands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day thou wilt not see him, nor to-morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the next day will be a day of sorrow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She weeps alone for pleasures not to be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorely she wept until the night came on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, instead of love, O misery!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She brooded oer the luxury alone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His image in the dusk she seemd to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the silence made a gentle moan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading her perfect arms upon the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her couch low murmuring, Where? O where?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Selfishness, Loves cousin, held not long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its fiery vigil in her single breast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fretted for the golden hour, and hung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the time with feverish unrest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long for soon into her heart a throng
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of higher occupants, a richer zest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came tragic; passion not to be subdued,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sorrow for her love in travels rude.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid days of autumn, on their eves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath of Winter comes from far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sick west continually bereaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some gold tinge, and plays a roundelay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of death among the bushes and the leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make all bare before he dares to stray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his north cavern. So sweet Isabel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By gradual decay from beauty fell,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lorenzo came not. Oftentimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She askd her brothers, with an eye all pale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Striving to be itself, what dungeon climes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could keep him off so long? They spake a tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time after time, to quiet her. Their crimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came on them, like a smoke from Hinnoms vale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every night in dreams they groand aloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see their sister in her snowy shroud.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she had died in drowsy ignorance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for a thing more deadly dark than all;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which saves a sick man from the featherd pall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some few gasping moments; like a lance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waking an Indian from his cloudy hall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With cruel pierce, and bringing him again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a vision. In the drowsy gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull of midnight, at her couchs foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo stood, and wept: the forest tomb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had marrd his glossy hair which once could shoot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lustre into the sun, and put cold doom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his lips, and taken the soft lute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his lorn voice, and past his loamed ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had made a miry channel for his tears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange sound it was, when the pale shadow spake;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there was striving, in its piteous tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak as when on earth it was awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Isabella on its music hung:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Languor there was in it, and tremulous shake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in a palsied Druids harp unstrung;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through it moand a ghostly under-song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its eyes, though wild, were still all dewy bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With love, and kept all phantom fear aloof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the poor girl by magic of their light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while it did unthread the horrid woof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the late darkend time, the murderous spite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pride and avarice, the dark pine roof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest, and the sodden turfed dell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, without any word, from stabs he fell.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying moreover, Isabel, my sweet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red whortle-berries droop above my head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a large flint-stone weighs upon my feet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around me beeches and high chestnuts shed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their leaves and prickly nuts; a sheep-fold bleat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes from beyond the river to my bed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, shed one tear upon my heather-bloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it shall comfort me within the tomb.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a shadow now, alas! alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the skirts of human-nature dwelling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone: I chant alone the holy mass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While little sounds of life are round me knelling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a chapel bell the hour is telling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paining me through: those sounds grow strange to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou art distant in Humanity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XL.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know what was, I feel full well what is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I should rage, if spirits could go mad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I forget the taste of earthly bliss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That paleness warms my grave, as though I had
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Seraph chosen from the bright abyss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be my spouse: thy paleness makes me glad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy beauty grows upon me, and I feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greater love through all my essence steal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit mournd Adieu! dissolvd, and left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atom darkness in a slow turmoil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when of healthful midnight sleep bereft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking on rugged hours and fruitless toil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put our eyes into a pillowy cleft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see the spangly gloom froth up and boil:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made sad Isabellas eyelids ache,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the dawn she started up awake;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha! ha! said she, I knew not this hard life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought the worst was simple misery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought some Fate with pleasure or with strife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portiond us happy days, or else to die;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is crime a brothers bloody knife!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Spirit, thou hast schoold my infancy:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill visit thee for this, and kiss thine eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And greet thee morn and even in the skies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the full morning came, she had devised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How she might secret to the forest hie;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How she might find the clay, so dearly prized,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing to it one latest lullaby;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How her short absence might be unsurmised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she the inmost of the dream would try.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolvd, she took with her an aged nurse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went into that dismal forest-hearse.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, as they creep along the river side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How she doth whisper to that aged Dame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, after looking round the champaign wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows her a knife. What feverous hectic flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burns in thee, child? What good can thee betide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou shouldst smile again? The evening came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they had found Lorenzos earthy bed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flint was there, the berries at his head.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath not loiterd in a green church-yard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let his spirit, like a demon-mole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see skull, coffind bones, and funeral stole;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitying each form that hungry Death hath marrd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filling it once more with human soul?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! this is holiday to what was felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Isabella by Lorenzo knelt.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gazd into the fresh-thrown mould, as though
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One glance did fully all its secrets tell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly she saw, as other eyes would know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale limbs at bottom of a crystal well;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the murderous spot she seemd to grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to a native lily of the dell:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with her knife, all sudden, she began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dig more fervently than misers can.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon she turnd up a soiled glove, whereon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her silk had playd in purple phantasies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kissd it with a lip more chill than stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put it in her bosom, where it dries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And freezes utterly unto the bone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those dainties made to still an infants cries:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then gan she work again; nor stayd her care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to throw back at times her veiling hair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That old nurse stood beside her wondering,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until her heart felt pity to the core
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sight of such a dismal labouring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so she kneeled, with her locks all hoar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put her lean hands to the horrid thing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours they labourd at this travail sore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last they felt the kernel of the grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Isabella did not stamp and rave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! wherefore all this wormy circumstance?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why linger at the yawning tomb so long?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O for the gentleness of old Romance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple plaining of a minstrels song!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair reader, at the old tale take a glance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For here, in truth, it doth not well belong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak: O turn thee to the very tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taste the music of that vision pale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With duller steel than the Persèan sword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cut away no formless monsters head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one, whose gentleness did well accord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With death, as life. The ancient harps have said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love never dies, but lives, immortal Lord:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Love impersonate was ever dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale Isabella kissd it, and low moand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twas love; cold, dead indeed, but not dethroned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anxious secrecy they took it home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the prize was all for Isabel:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calmd its wild hair with a golden comb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all around each eyes sepulchral cell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointed each fringed lash; the smeared loam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tears, as chilly as a dripping well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She drenchd away: and still she combd, and kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing all day and still she kissd, and wept.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in a silken scarf, sweet with the dews
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of precious flowers pluckd in Araby,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And divine liquids come with odorous ooze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the cold serpent pipe refreshfully,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wrappd it up; and for its tomb did choose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A garden-pot, wherein she laid it by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And coverd it with mould, and oer it set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Basil, which her tears kept ever wet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she forgot the blue above the trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she forgot the dells where waters run,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had no knowledge when the day was done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the new morn she saw not: but in peace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung over her sweet Basil evermore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And moistend it with tears unto the core.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so she ever fed it with thin tears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence thick, and green, and beautiful it grew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that it smelt more balmy than its peers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Basil-tufts in Florence; for it drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurture besides, and life, from human fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fast mouldering head there shut from view:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the jewel, safely casketed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came forth, and in perfumed leafits spread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Melancholy, linger here awhile!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Music, Music, breathe despondingly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Echo, Echo, from some sombre isle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown, Lethean, sigh to us O sigh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits in grief, lift up your heads, and smile;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift up your heads, sweet Spirits, heavily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make a pale light in your cypress glooms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinting with silver wan your marble tombs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moan hither, all ye syllables of woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the deep throat of sad Melpomene!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through bronzed lyre in tragic order go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch the strings into a mystery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound mournfully upon the winds and low;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For simple Isabel is soon to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the dead: She withers, like a palm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut by an Indian for its juicy balm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O leave the palm to wither by itself;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let not quick Winter chill its dying hour!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be those Baalites of pelf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brethren, noted the continual shower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her dead eyes; and many a curious elf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among her kindred, wonderd that such dower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of youth and beauty should be thrown aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By one markd out to be a Nobles bride.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, furthermore, her brethren wonderd much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why she sat drooping by the Basil green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why it flourishd, as by magic touch;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greatly they wonderd what the thing might mean:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could not surely give belief, that such
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very nothing would have power to wean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her from her own fair youth, and pleasures gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even remembrance of her loves delay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore they watchd a time when they might sift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hidden whim; and long they watchd in vain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For seldom did she go to chapel-shrift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seldom felt she any hunger-pain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when she left, she hurried back, as swift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As bird on wing to breast its eggs again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, patient as a hen-bird, sat her there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside her Basil, weeping through her hair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet they contrivd to steal the Basil-pot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to examine it in secret place:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing was vile with green and livid spot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet they knew it was Lorenzos face:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guerdon of their murder they had got,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so left Florence in a moments space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never to turn again. Away they went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blood upon their heads, to banishment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Melancholy, turn thine eyes away!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Music, Music, breathe despondingly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Echo, Echo, on some other day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From isles Lethean, sigh to us O sigh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits of grief, sing not your Well-a-way!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Isabel, sweet Isabel, will die;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will die a death too lone and incomplete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they have taen away her Basil sweet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piteous she lookd on dead and senseless things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking for her lost Basil amorously:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with melodious chuckle in the strings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Pilgrim in his wanderings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask him where her Basil was; and why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twas hid from her: For cruel tis, said she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To steal my Basil-pot away from me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so she pined, and so she died forlorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imploring for her Basil to the last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No heart was there in Florence but did mourn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pity of her love, so overcast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a sad ditty of this story born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From mouth to mouth through all the country passd:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still is the burthen sung O cruelty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To steal my Basil-pot away from me!

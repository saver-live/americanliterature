<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watching, with eternal lids apart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moving waters at their priest-like task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of snow upon the mountains and the moors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so live ever, or else swoon to death.

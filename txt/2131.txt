<p>DEAR love, for nothing less than thee<br> Would I have broke this happy dream;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:4em;">&nbsp;</span>It was a theme<br> For reason, much too strong for fantasy.<br> Therefore thou waked'st me wisely; yet<br> My dream thou brokest not, but continued'st it.<br> Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice<br> To make dreams truths, and fables histories;<br> Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best,<br> Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.<br> <br> As lightning, or a taper's light,<br> Thine eyes, and not thy noise waked me;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:4em;">&nbsp;</span>Yet I thought thee<br> —For thou lovest truth—an angel, at first sight;<br> But when I saw thou saw'st my heart,<br> And knew'st my thoughts beyond an angel's art,<br> When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when<br> Excess of joy would wake me, and camest then,<br> I must confess, it could not choose but be<br> Profane, to think thee any thing but thee.<br> <br> Coming and staying show'd thee, thee,<br> But rising makes me doubt, that now<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:4em;">&nbsp;</span>Thou art not thou.<br> That love is weak where fear's as strong as he;<br> 'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave,<br> If mixture it of fear, shame, honour have;<br> Perchance as torches, which must ready be,<br> Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me;<br> Thou camest to kindle, go'st to come; then I<br> Will dream that hope again, but else would die.</p>

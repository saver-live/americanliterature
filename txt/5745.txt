<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What an image of peace and rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this little church among its graves!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is so quiet; the troubled breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounded spirit, the heart oppressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here may find the repose it craves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, how the ivy climbs and expands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over this humble hermitage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seems to caress with its little hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rough, gray stones, as a child that stands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caressing the wrinkled cheeks of age!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cross the threshold; and dim and small
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the space that serves for the Shepherd's Fold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow aisle, the bare, white wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pews, and the pulpit quaint and tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whisper and say: "Alas! we are old."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herbert's chapel at Bemerton
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly more spacious is than this;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Poet and Pastor, blent in one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothed with a splendor, as of the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lowly and holy edifice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the wall of stone without
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes the building small or great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soul's light shining round about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the faith that overcometh doubt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the love that stronger is than hate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were I a pilgrim in search of peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were I a pastor of Holy Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a Bishop's diocese
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I prize this place of rest, and release
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From farther longing and farther search.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here would I stay, and let the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its distant thunder roar and roll;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storms do not rend the sail that is furled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor like a dead leaf, tossed and whirled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an eddy of wind, is the anchored soul.

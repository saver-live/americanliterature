<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two angels, one of Life and one of Death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed o'er our village as the morning broke;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn was on their faces, and beneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sombre houses hearsed with plumes of smoke.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their attitude and aspect were the same,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike their features and their robes of white;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one was crowned with amaranth, as with flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one with asphodels, like flakes of light.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw them pause on their celestial way;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said I, with deep fear and doubt oppressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beat not so loud, my heart, lest thou betray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where thy beloved are at rest!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he who wore the crown of asphodels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending, at my door began to knock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my soul sank within me, as in wells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waters sink before an earthquake's shock.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognized the nameless agony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terror and the tremor and the pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That oft before had filled or haunted me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now returned with threefold strength again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door I opened to my heavenly guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listened, for I thought I heard God's voice;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, knowing whatsoe'er he sent was best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dared neither to lament nor to rejoice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a smile, that filled the house with light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My errand is not Death, but Life," he said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ere I answered, passing out of sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his celestial embassy he sped.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was at thy door, O friend! and not at mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel with the amaranthine wreath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing, descended, and with voice divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered a word that had a sound like Death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fell upon the house a sudden gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow on those features fair and thin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And softly, from that hushed and darkened room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two angels issued, where but one went in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is of God!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he but wave his hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mists collect, the rain falls thick and loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, with a smile of light on sea and land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! he looks back from the departing cloud.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angels of Life and Death alike are his;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without his leave they pass no threshold o'er;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, then, would wish or dare, believing this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against his messengers to shut the door?

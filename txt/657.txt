<p>Last year we fought by the head-stream of the Sang-kan,<br> This year we are fighting on the Tsung-ho road.<br> We have washed our armor in the waves of the Chiao-chi lake,<br> We have pastured our horses on Tien-shan's snowy slopes.<br> The long, long war goes on ten thousand miles from home,<br> Our three armies are worn and grown old.<br> <br> The barbarian does man-slaughter for plowing;<br> On this yellow sand-plains nothing has been seen but<br> blanched skulls and bones.<br> Where the Chin emperor built the walls against the Tartars,<br> There the defenders of Han are burning beacon fires.<br> The beacon fires burn and never go out,<br> There is no end to war!<br> <br> In the battlefield men grapple each other and die;<br> The horses of the vanquished utter lamentable cries to heaven,<br> While ravens and kites peck at human entrails,<br> Carry them up in their flight, and hang them on the branches of dead trees.<br> So, men are scattered and smeared over the desert grass,<br> And the generals have accomplished nothing.<br> <br> Oh, nefarious war! I see why arms<br> Were so seldom used by the benign sovereigns. <br></p>

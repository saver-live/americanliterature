<p>The sky is cloudy, yellowed by the smoke.<br> For view there are the houses opposite<br> Cutting the sky with one long line of wall<br> Like solid fog: far as the eye can stretch<br> Monotony of surface &amp; of form<br> Without a break to hang a guess upon.<br> No bird can make a shadow as it flies,<br> For all is shadow, as in ways o'erhung<br> By thickest canvass, where the golden rays<br> Are clothed in hemp. No figure lingering<br> Pauses to feed the hunger of the eye<br> Or rest a little on the lap of life.<br> All hurry on &amp; look upon the ground,<br> Or glance unmarking at the passers by<br> The wheels are hurrying too, cabs, carriages<br> All closed, in multiplied identity.<br> The world seems one huge prison-house &amp; court<br> Where men are punished at the slightest cost,<br> With lowest rate of colour, warmth &amp; joy.</p><p>The sky is cloudy, yellowed by the smoke.<br> For view there are the houses opposite<br> Cutting the sky with one long line of wall<br> Like solid fog: far as the eye can stretch<br> Monotony of surface &amp; of form<br> Without a break to hang a guess upon.<br> No bird can make a shadow as it flies,<br> For all is shadow, as in ways o'erhung<br> By thickest canvass, where the golden rays<br> Are clothed in hemp.

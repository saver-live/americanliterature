<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora Leigh, be humble. Shall I hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak my poems in mysterious tune
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With man and nature? with the lava-lymph
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That trickles from successive galaxies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still drop by drop adown the finger of God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In still new worlds? with summer-days in this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scarce dare breathe they are so beautiful?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With spring's delicious trouble in the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tormented by the quickened blood of roots,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And softly pricked by golden crocus-sheaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In token of the harvest-time of flowers?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With winters and with autumns, and beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the human heart's large seasons, when it hopes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fears, joys, grieves, and loves? with all that strain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sexual passion, which devours the flesh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sacrament of souls? with mother's breasts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, round the new-made creatures hanging there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throb luminous and harmonious like pure spheres?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With multitudinous life, and finally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the great escapings of ecstatic souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, in a rush of too long prisoned flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their radiant faces upward, burn away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dark of the body, issuing on a world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond our mortal? can I speak my verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So plainly in tune to these things and the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That men shall feel it catch them on the quick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As having the same warrant over them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold and move them if they will or no,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike imperious as the primal rhythm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that theurgic nature? I must fail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fail at the beginning to hold and move
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One man, and he my cousin, and he my friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he born tender, made intelligent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclined to ponder the precipitous sides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of difficult questions; yet, obtuse to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of me, incurious! likes me very well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wishes me a paradise of good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good looks, good means, and good digestion, ay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But otherwise evades me, puts me off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With kindness, with a tolerant gentleness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too light a book for a grave man's reading! Go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora Leigh: be humble.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There it is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We women are too apt to look to one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which proves a certain impotence in art.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strain our natures at doing something great,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far less because it's something great to do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than haply that we, so, commend ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As being not small, and more appreciable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some one friend. We must have mediators
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt our highest conscience and the judge;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some sweet saint's blood must quicken in our palms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or all the life in heaven seems slow and cold:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good only being perceived as the end of good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God alone pleased, that's too poor, we think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not enough for us by any means.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay Romney, I remember, told me once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We miss the abstract when we comprehend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We miss it most when we aspire, and fail.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, so, I will not. This vile woman's way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of trailing garments shall not trip me up:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll have no traffic with the personal thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Art's pure temple. Must I work in vain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the approbation of a man?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot be; it shall not. Fame itself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That approbation of the general race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presents a poor end (though the arrow speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot straight with vigorous finger to the white),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the highest fame was never reached except
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By what was aimed above it. Art for art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And good for God Himself, the essential Good!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our woman-hands should shake and fail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we fail . . . But must we?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I fail?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let no one be called happy till his death."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which I add, Let no one till his death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be called unhappy. Measure not the work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the day's out and the labour done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then bring your gauges. If the day's work's scant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, call it scant; affect no compromise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in that we have nobly striven at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deal with us nobly, women though we be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And honour us with truth if not with praise.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ballads prospered; but the ballad's race
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is rapid for a poet who bears weights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thought and golden image. He can stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Atlas, in the sonnet, and support
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own heavens pregnant with dynastic stars;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then he must stand still, nor take a step.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that descriptive poem called "The Hills,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospects were too far and indistinct.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis true my critics said "A fine view, that!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public scarcely cared to climb my book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For even the finest, and the public's right;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tree's mere firewood, unless humanised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which well the Greeks knew when they stirred its bark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With close-pressed bosoms of subsiding nymphs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made the forest-rivers garrulous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With babble of gods. For us, we are called to mark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A still more intimate humanity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this inferior nature, or ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must fall like dead leaves trodden underfoot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By veritable artists. Earth (shut up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Adam, like a fakir in a box
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left too long buried) remained stiff and dry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mere dumb corpse, till Christ the Lord came down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlocked the doors, forced open the blank eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And used His kingly chrism to straighten out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leathery tongue turned back into the throat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since when, she lives, remembers, palpitates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every limb, aspires in every breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embraces infinite relations. Now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want no half-gods, Panomphæan Joves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fauns, Naiads, Tritons, Oreads and the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take possession of a senseless world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To unnatural vampire-uses. See the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of our body, the green earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indubitably human like this flesh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these articulated veins through which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our heart drives blood. There's not a flower of spring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dies ere June but vaunts itself allied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By issue and symbol, by significance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And correspondence, to that spirit-world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the limits of our space and time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereto we are bound. Let poets give it voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With human meanings, else they miss the thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And henceforth step down lower, stand confessed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructed poorly for interpreters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrown out by an easy cowslip in the text.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so my pastoral failed: it was a book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of surface-pictures pretty, cold, and false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With literal transcript, the worse done, I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For being not ill-done: let me set my mark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against such doings, and do otherwise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strikes me. If the public whom we know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could catch me at such admissions, I should pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For being right modest. Yet how proud we are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In daring to look down upon ourselves!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critics say that epics have died out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Agamemnon and the goat-nursed gods;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll not believe it. I could never deem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Payne Knight did (the mythic mountaineer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who travelled higher than he was born to live,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And showed sometimes the goitre in his throat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discoursing of an image seen through fog),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Homer's heroes measured twelve feet high.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were but men: his Helen's hair turned grey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any plain Miss Smith's who wears a front;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hector's infant whimpered at a plume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As yours last Friday at a turkey-cock.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All actual heroes are essential men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all men possible heroes: every age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic in proportions, double-faced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks backward and before, expects a morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And claims an epos.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, but every age
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appears to souls who live in't (ask Carlyle)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most unheroic. Ours, for instance, ours:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thinkers scout it, and the poets abound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who scorn to touch it with a finger-tip:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pewter age, mixed metal, silver-washed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An age of scum, spooned off the richer past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An age of patches for old gaberdines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An age of mere transition, meaning nought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except that what succeeds must shame it quite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If God please. That's wrong thinking, to my mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrong thoughts make poor poems.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through being beheld too close, is ill-discerned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By those who have not lived past it. We'll suppose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mount Athos carved, as Alexander schemed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some colossal statue of a man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peasants, gathering brushwood in his ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had guessed as little as the browsing goats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of form or feature of humanity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up there, in fact, had travelled five miles off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ere the giant image broke on them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full human profile, nose and chin distinct,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouth, muttering rhythms of silence up the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fed at evening with the blood of suns;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand torso, hand, that flung perpetually
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largesse of a silver river down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the country pastures. 'Tis even thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With times we live in, evermore too great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be apprehended near.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But poets should
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exert a double vision; should have eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see near things as comprehensively
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if afar they took their point of sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And distant things as intimately deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they touched them. Let us strive for this.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do distrust the poet who discerns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No character or glory in his times,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trundles back his soul five hundred years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past moat and drawbridge, into a castle-court,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sing oh, not of lizard or of toad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive i' the ditch there, 'twere excusable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of some black chief, half knight, half sheep-lifter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some beauteous dame, half chattel and half queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dead as must be, for the greater part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poems made on their chivalric bones;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's no wonder: death inherits death.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, if there's room for poets in this world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little overgrown (I think there is),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sole work is to represent the age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their age, not Charlemagne's, this live, throbbing age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brawls, cheats, maddens, calculates, aspires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spends more passion, more heroic heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt the mirrors of its drawing-rooms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Roland with his knights at Roncesvalles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To flinch from modern varnish, coat or flounce,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry out for togas and the picturesque,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is fatal, foolish too. King Arthur's self
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was commonplace to Lady Guenever;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Camelot to minstrels seemed as flat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Fleet Street to our poets.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never flinch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still, unscrupulously epic, catch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the burning lava of a song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-veined, heaving, double-breasted Age:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, when the next shall come, the men of that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May touch the impress with reverent hand, and say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold, behold the paps we all have sucked!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bosom seems to beat still, or at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sets ours beating: this is living art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which thus presents and thus records true life."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What form is best for poems? Let me think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of forms less, and the external. Trust the spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sovran nature does, to make the form;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For otherwise we only imprison spirit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not embody. Inward evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To outward, so in life, and so in art
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which still is life.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five acts to make a play.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why not fifteen? why not ten? or seven?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter for the number of the leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing the tree lives and grows? exact
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The literal unities of time and place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 'tis the essence of passion to ignore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both time and place? Absurd. Keep up the fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the generous flames to shape themselves.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis true the stage requires obsequiousness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this or that convention; "exit" here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "enter" there; the points for clapping, fixed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Jacob's white-peeled rods before the rams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the close-curled imagery clipped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In manner of their fleece at shearing-time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget to prick the galleries to the heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely at the fourth act, culminate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our five pyramidal acts with one act more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're lost so: Shakespeare's ghost could scarcely plead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against our just damnation. Stand aside;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll muse for comfort that, last century,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this same tragic stage on which we have failed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wigless Hamlet would have failed the same.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whosoever writes good poetry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks just to art. He does not write for you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or me, for London or for Edinburgh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not suffer the best critic known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To step into his sunshine of free thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And self-absorbed conception and exact
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inch-long swerving of the holy lines.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If virtue done for popularity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defiles like vice, can art, for praise or hire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still keep its splendour and remain pure art?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eschew such serfdom. What the poet writes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He writes: mankind accepts it if it suits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's success: if not, the poem's passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hand to hand, and yet from hand to hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the unborn snatch it, crying out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pity on their fathers' being so dull,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's success too.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will write no plays;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the drama, less sublime in this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes lower appeals, submits more menially,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopts the standard of the public taste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To chalk its height on, wears a dog-chain round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its regal neck, and learns to carry and fetch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fashions of the day to please the day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fawns close on pit and boxes, who clap hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commending chiefly its docility
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And humour in stage-tricks, or else indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gets hissed at, howled at, stamped at like a dog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or worse, we'll say. For dogs, unjustly kicked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yell, bite at need; but if your dramatist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Being wronged by some five hundred nobodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because their grosser brains most naturally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misjudge the fineness of his subtle wit)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows teeth an almond's breadth, protests the length
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a modest phrase, "My gentle countrymen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's something in it haply of your fault,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then, besides five hundred nobodies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll have five thousand and five thousand more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against him, the whole public, all the hoofs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of King Saul's father's asses, in full drove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And obviously deserve it. He appealed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To these, and why say more if they condemn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than if they praise him? Weep, my Æschylus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But low and far, upon Sicilian shores!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For since 'twas Athens (so I read the myth)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gave commission to that fatal weight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tortoise, cold and hard, to drop on thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crush thee, better cover thy bald head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She'll hear the softest hum of Hyblan bee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before thy loudest protestation!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk's still worse upon the modern stage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not, for so little, accept success,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor would I risk so much, in ease and calm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For manifester gains: let those who prize,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursue them: I stand off. And yet, forbid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That any irreverent fancy or conceit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should litter in the Drama's throne-room where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rulers of our art, in whose full veins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynastic glories mingle, sit in strength
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do their kingly work, conceive, command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, from the imagination's crucial heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch up their men and women all a-flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For action, all alive and forced to prove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their life by living out heart, brain, and nerve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until mankind makes witness, "These be men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are," and vouchsafes the greeting due
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Imogen and Juliet sweetest kin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On art's side.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis that, honouring to its worth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drama, I would fear to keep it down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the level of the footlights. Dies no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrificial goat, for Bacchus slain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His filmed eyes fluttered by the whirling white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of choral vestures, troubled in his blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While tragic voices that clanged keen as swords,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leapt high together with the altar-flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made the blue air wink. The waxen mask,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which set the grand still front of Themis' son
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the puckered visage of a player,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buskin, which he rose upon and moved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some tall ship first conscious of the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeps slowly past the piers, the mouthpiece, where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere man's voice with all its breaths and breaks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went sheathed in brass, and clashed on even heights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its phrasèd thunders, these things are no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which once were. And concluding, which is clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing drama has outgrown such toys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of simulated stature, face, and speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also peradventure may outgrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simulation of the painted scene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boards, actors, prompters, gaslight, and costume,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take for a worthier stage the soul itself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its shifting fancies and celestial lights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its grand orchestral silences
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the pauses of its rhythmic sounds.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, I still see something to be done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what I do falls short of what I see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I waste myself on doing. Long green days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worn bare of grass and sunshine, long calm nights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which the silken sleeps were fretted out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be witness for me, with no amateur's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irreverent haste and busy idleness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I set myself to art! What then? what's done?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's done, at last?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, at last, a book.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If life-blood's necessary, which it is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(By that blue vein athrob on Mahomet's brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each prophet-poet's book must show man's blood!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If life-blood's fertilising, I wrung mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On every leaf of this, unless the drops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slid heavily on one side and left it dry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That chances often: many a fervid man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writes books as cold and flat as graveyard stones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which the lichen's scraped; and if Saint Preux
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had written his own letters, as he might,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had never wept to think of the little mole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath Julie's drooping eyelid. Passion is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But something suffered, after all.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Art
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets action on the top of suffering:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artist's part is both to be and do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfixing with a special, central power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flat experience of the common man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turning outward, with a sudden wrench,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half agony, half ecstasy, the thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels the inmost, never felt the less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he sings it. Does a torch less burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For burning next reflectors of blue steel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he should be the colder for his place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt two incessant fires, his personal life's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that intense refraction which burns back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perpetually against him from the round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of crystal conscience he was born into
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If artist-born? O sorrowful great gift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conferred on poets, of a twofold life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one life has been found enough for pain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, staggering 'neath our burden as mere men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being called to stand up straight as demigods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support the intolerable strain and stress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the universal, and send clearly up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With voices broken by the human sob,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our poems to find rhymes among the stars!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soft, a "poet" is a word soon said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book's a thing soon written. Nay, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the poet shall be questionable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more unquestionably comes his book.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this of mine well, granting to myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some passion in it, furrowing up the flats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere passion will not prove a volume worth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its gall and rags even. Bubbles round a keel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean nought, excepting that the vessel moves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's more than passion goes to make a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or book, which is a man too.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if Pygmalion had these doubts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, feeling the hard marble first relent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow supple to the straining of his arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tingle through its cold to his burning lip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposed his senses mocked, supposed the toil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of stretching past the known and seen to reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archetypal Beauty out of sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had made his heart beat fast enough for two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with his own life dazed and blinded him!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so; Pygmalion loved, and whoso loves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believes the impossible.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am sad:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot thoroughly love a work of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since none seems worthy of my thought and hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More highly mated. He has shot them down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Phoebus Apollo, soul within my soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who judges, by the attempted, what's attained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the silver arrow from his height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has struck down all my works before my face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I said nothing. Is there aught to say?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I called the artist but a greatened man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may be childless also, like a man.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laboured on alone. The wind and dust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sun of the world beat blistering in my face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hope, now for me, now against me, dragged
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My spirits onward, as some fallen balloon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, whether caught by blossoming tree or bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is torn alike. I sometimes touched my aim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or seemed, and generous souls cried out "Be strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take courage; now you're on our level, now!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step saves you!" I was flushed with praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, pausing just a moment to draw breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not choose but murmur to myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this all? all that's done? and all that's gained?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this then be success, 'tis dismaller
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any failure."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my God, my God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O supreme Artist, who as sole return
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the cosmic wonder of Thy work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demandest of us just a word . . . a name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Father!" thou hast knowledge, only thou,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How dreary 'tis for women to sit still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On winter nights by solitary fires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the nations praising them far off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too far! ay, praising our quick sense of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our very heart of passionate womanhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which could not beat so in the verse without
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being present also in the unkissed lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eyes undried because there's none to ask
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason they grew moist.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sit alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think for comfort how, that very night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affianced lovers, leaning face to face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sweet half-listenings for each other's breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are reading haply from a page of ours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pause with a thrill (as if their cheeks had touched)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When such a stanza, level to their mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems floating their own thought out "So I feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thee," "And I, for thee: this poet knows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What everlasting love is!" how, that night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some father, issuing from the misty roads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the luminous round of lamp and hearth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And happy children, having caught up first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youngest there until it shrink and shriek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel the cold chin prick its dimples through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With winter from the hills, may throw i' the lap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the eldest (who has learnt to drop her lids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hide some sweetness newer than last year's)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our book and cry, . . . "Ah you, you care for rhymes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here be rhymes to pore on under trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When April comes to let you! I've been told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not idle as so many are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But set hearts beating pure as well as fast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis yours, the book; I'll write your name in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That so you may not lose, however lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In poet's lore and charming reverie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of how your father thought of you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In riding from the town."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have our books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appraised by love, associated with love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we sit loveless! is it hard, you think?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 'tis mournful. Fame, indeed, 'twas said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Means simply love. It was a man said that:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, there's love and love: the love of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To risk in turn a woman's paradox)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but a small thing to the love of one.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You bid a hungry child be satisfied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a heritage of many corn-fields: nay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says he's hungry, he would rather have
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That little barley-cake you keep from him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While reckoning up his harvests. So with us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Here, Romney, too, we fail to generalise):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're hungry.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry! but it's pitiful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wail like unweaned babes and suck our thumbs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we're hungry. Who, in all this world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Wherein we are haply set to pray and fast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learn what good is by its opposite),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has never hungered? Woe to him who has found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meal enough! if Ugolino's full,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His teeth have crunched some foul unnatural thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For here satiety proves penury
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More utterly irremediable. And since
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We needs must hunger, better, for man's love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than God's truth! better, for companions sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than great convictions! let us bear our weights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferring dreary hearths to desert souls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, well! they say we're envious, we who rhyme;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I, because I am a woman perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so rhyme ill, am ill at envying.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never envied Graham his breadth of style,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which gives you, with a random smutch or two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Near-sighted critics analyse to smutch),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such delicate perspectives of full life:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor Belmore, for the unity of aim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which he cuts his cedarn poems, fine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sketchers do their pencils: nor Mark Gage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that caressing colour and trancing tone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereby you're swept away and melted in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensual element, which with a back wave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restores you to the level of pure souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves you with Plotinus. None of these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For native gifts or popular applause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've envied; but for this, that when by chance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says some one, "There goes Belmore, a great man!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaves clean work behind him, and requires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sweeper up of the chips," . . . a girl I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who answers nothing, save with her brown eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiles unaware as if a guardian saint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled in her: for this, too, that Gage comes home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lays his last book's prodigal review
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his mother's knee, where, years ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laid his childish spelling-book and learned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To chirp and peck the letters from her mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As young birds must. "Well done," she murmured then;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will not say it now more wonderingly:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the last "Well done" will touch him more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As catching up to-day and yesterday
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a perfect chord of love: and so, Mark Gage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I envy you your mother! and you, Graham,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you have a wife who loves you so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She half forgets, at moments, to be proud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of being Graham's wife, until a friend observes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boy here has his father's massive brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Done small in wax . . . if we push back the curls."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loves me? Dearest father, mother sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak the names out sometimes by myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make the silence shiver. They sound strange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Hindostanee to an Ind-born man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accustomed many years to English speech;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lovely poet-words grown obsolete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which will not leave off singing. Up in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have my father, with my mother's face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him in a blotch of heavenly light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more for earth's familiar, household use,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more. The best verse written by this hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can never reach them where they sit, to seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done to them. Death quite unfellows us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets dreadful odds betwixt the live and dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes us part as those at Babel did
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sudden ignorance of a common tongue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A living Cæsar would not dare to play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At bowls with such as my dead father is.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet this may be less so than appears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change and separation. Sparrows five
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For just two farthings, and God cares for each.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If God is not too great for little cares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is any creature, because gone to God?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen some men, veracious, nowise mad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have thought or dreamed, declared and testified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard the Dead a-ticking like a clock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which strikes the hours of the eternities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside them, with their natural ears, and known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That human spirits feel the human way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hate the unreasoning awe which waves them off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From possible communion. It may be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, earth separates as well as heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, I have not seen Romney Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full eighteen months . . . add six, you get two years.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say he's very busy with good works,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has parted Leigh Hall into almshouses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made one day an almshouse of his heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ever since is loose upon the latch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who pull the string. I never did.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It always makes me sad to go abroad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I'm sadder that I went to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the lights and talkers at Lord Howe's.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife is gracious, with her glossy braids,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even voice, and gorgeous eyeballs, calm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As her other jewels. If she's somewhat cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wonders, when her blood has stood so long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ducal reservoir she calls her line
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By no means arrogantly? she's not proud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not prouder than the swan is of the lake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always swum in; 'tis her element;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so she takes it with a natural grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring tadpoles. She just knows perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are who travel without outriders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which isn't her fault. Ah, to watch her face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When good Lord Howe expounds his theories
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of social justice and equality!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis curious, what a tender, tolerant bend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her neck takes: for she loves him, likes his talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Such clever talk that dear, odd Algernon!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She listens on, exactly as if he talked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Scandinavian myth of Lemures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too pretty to dispute, and too absurd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's gracious to me as her husband's friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would be gracious were I not a Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being used to smile just so, without her eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Joseph Strangways the Leeds mesmerist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Delia Dobbs the lecturer from "the States"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the "Woman's question." Then, for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like him; he's my friend. And all the rooms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were full of crinkling silks that swept about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine dust of most subtle courtesies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then? why then, we come home to be sad.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How lovely, One I love not looked to-night!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's very pretty, Lady Waldemar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her maid must use both hands to twist that coil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tresses, then be careful lest the rich
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronze rounds should slip: she missed, though, a grey hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single one, I saw it; otherwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looked immortal. How they told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those alabaster shoulders and bare breasts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which the pearls, drowned out of sight in milk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were lost, excepting for the ruby-clasp!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They split the amaranth velvet-bodice down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the waist or nearly, with the audacious press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of full-breathed beauty. If the heart within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were half as white! but, if it were, perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breast were closer covered and the sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less aspectable by half, too.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man with the German student's look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp face, like a knife in a cleft stick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which shot up straight against the parting line
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So equally dividing the long hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say softly to his neighbour (thirty-five
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mediæval), "Look that way, Sir Blaise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's Lady Waldemar to the left in red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom Romney Leigh, our ablest man just now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is soon about to marry."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then replied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Blaise Delorme, with quiet, priestlike voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too used to syllable damnations round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a natural emphasis worth while:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Leigh your ablest man? the same, I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once jilted by a recreant pretty maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopted from the people? Now, in change,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have plucked a flower from the other side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the social hedge."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A flower, a flower," exclaimed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My German student, his own eyes full-blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent on her. He was twenty, certainly.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Blaise resumed with gentle arrogance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he had dropped his alms into a hat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gained the right to counsel, "My young friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt your ablest man's ability
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the least good or help meet for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pagan phalanstery or Christian home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From such a flowery creature."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My student murmured rapt, "Mark how she stirs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just waves her head, as if a flower indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched far off by the vain breath of our talk."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which that bilious Grimwald (he who writes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Renovator), who had seemed absorbed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the table-book of autographs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I dare say mentally he crunched the bones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all those writers, wishing them alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel his tooth in earnest), turned short round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With low carnivorous laugh, "A flower, of course!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She neither sews nor spins, and takes no thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her garments . . . falling off."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student flinched;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Blaise, the same; then both, drawing back their chairs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they spied black-beetles on the floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursued their talk, without a word being thrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the critic.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Sir Blaise's brow is high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And noticeably narrow: a strong wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You fancy, might unroof him suddenly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blow that great top attic off his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So piled with feudal relics. You admire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nose in profile, though you miss his chin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, though you miss his chin, you seldom miss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ebon cross worn innermostly (carved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For penance by a saintly Styrian monk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose flesh was too much with him), slipping through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some unaware unbuttoned casualty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the under-waistcoat. With an absent air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Blaise sat fingering it and speaking low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I, upon the sofa, heard it all.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear young friend, if we could bear our eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like blessedest Saint Lucy, on a plate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would not trick us into choosing wives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As doublets, by the colour. Otherwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fathers chose, and therefore, when they had hung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their household keys about a lady's waist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of duty gave her dignity;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept her bosom holy to her babes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if a moralist reproved her dress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas 'Too much starch!' and not 'Too little lawn!'"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, pshaw!" returned the other in a heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little fretted by being called "young friend,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or so I took it, "for Saint Lucy's sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she's the saint to swear by, let us leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fathers, plagued enough about our sons!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He stroked his beardless chin) "yes, plagued, sir, plagued:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future generations lie on us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As heavy as the nightmare of a seer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our meat and drink grow painful prophecy:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask you, have we leisure, if we liked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hollow out our weary hands to keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your intermittent rushlight of the past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From draughts in lobbies? Prejudice of sex
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And marriage-law . . . the socket drops them through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we two speak, however may protest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some over-delicate nostrils like your own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Gainst odours thence arising."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are young,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Blaise objected.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am," he said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fire, "though somewhat less so than I seem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young run on before, and see the thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's coming. Reverence for the young, I cry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that new church for which the world's near ripe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll have the younger in the Elder's chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presiding with his ivory front of hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er foreheads clawed by cruel carrion-birds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life's experience."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray your blessing, sir,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Blaise replied good-humouredly, "I plucked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver hair this morning from my beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which left me your inferior. Would I were
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighteen and worthy to admonish you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If young men of your order run before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see such sights as sexual prejudice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And marriage-law dissolved, in plainer words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general concubinage expressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a universal pruriency, the thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is scarce worth running fast for, and you'd gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By loitering with your elders."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who, getting to the top of Pisgah-hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can talk with one at bottom of the view,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it comprehensible? Why, Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself, although our ablest man, I said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is scarce advanced to see as far as this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which some are: he takes up imperfectly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social question by one handle leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest to trail. A Christian socialist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Romney Leigh, you understand."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disbelieve in Christian-pagans, much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you in women-fishes. If we mix
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two colours, we lose both, and make a third
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinct from either. Mark you! to mistake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A colour is the sign of a sick brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mine, I thank the saints, is clear and cool:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A neutral tint is here impossible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church, and by the church I mean, of course,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The catholic, apostolic, mother-church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draws lines as plain and straight as her own walls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside of which are Christians, obviously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And outside . . . dogs."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We thank you. Well I know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient mother-church would fain still bite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all her toothless gums, as Leigh himself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would fain be a Christian still, for all his wit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass that; you two may settle it, for me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're slow in England. In a month I learnt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Göttingen enough philosophy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stock your English schools for fifty years;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass that, too. Here alone, I stop you short,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing a true man like Leigh could stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unequal in the stature of his life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the height of his opinions. Choose a wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of a smooth skin? not he, not he!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd rail at Venus' self for creaking shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless she walked his way of righteousness:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if he takes a Venus Meretrix
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(No imputation on the lady there),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure that, by some sleight of Christian art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has metamorphosed and converted her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a Blessed Virgin."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soft!" Sir Blaise drew breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it hurt him, "Soft! no blasphemy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray you!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first Christians did the thing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not the last?" asked he of Göttingen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just that shade of sneering on the lip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensates for the lagging of the beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And so the case is. If that fairest fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is talked of as the future wife of Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's talked of too, at least as certainly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Leigh's disciple. You may find her name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all his missions and commissions, schools,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asylums, hospitals, he had her down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With other ladies whom her starry lead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuaded from their spheres, to his country-place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Shropshire, to the famed phalanstery
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Leigh Hall, christianised from Fourier's own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In which he has planted out his sapling stocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of knowledge into social nurseries),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, they say, she has tarried half a week,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And milked the cows, and churned, and pressed the curd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said 'my sister' to the lowest drab
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the assembled castaways; such girls!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, sided with them at the washing-tub
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceive, Sir Blaise, those naked perfect arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round glittering arms, plunged elbow-deep in suds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like wild swans hid in lilies all a-shake."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Howe came up. "What, talking poetry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So near the image of the unfavouring Muse?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's you, Miss Leigh: I've watched you half an hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely as I watched the statue called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Pallas in the Vatican; you mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face, Sir Blaise? intensely calm and sad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wisdom cut it off from fellowship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that spoke louder. Not a word from you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these two gentlemen were bold, I marked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unabashed by even your silence."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said I, "my dear Lord Howe, you shall not speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a printing woman who has lost her place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The sweet safe corner of the household fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the heads of children), compliments,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she were a woman. We who have clipt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curls before our eyes may see at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As plain as men do. Speak out, man to man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No compliments, beseech you."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friend to friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let that be. We are sad to-night, I saw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( Good night, Sir Blaise! ah, Smith he has slipped away),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw you across the room, and stayed, Miss Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep a crowd of lion-hunters off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With faces toward your jungle. There were three;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spacious lady, five feet ten and fat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has the devil in her (and there's room)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For walking to and fro upon the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Chipewa to China; she requires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your autograph upon a tinted leaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt Queen Pomare's and Emperor Soulouque's.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray give it; she has energies, though fat:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I'd rather see a rick on fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than such a woman angry. Then a youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh from the backwoods, green as the underboughs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asks modestly, Miss Leigh, to kiss your shoe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And adds, he has an epic in twelve parts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which when you've read, you'll do it for his boot:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All which I saved you, and absorb next week
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both manuscript and man, because a lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is still more potent than a poetess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With any extreme republican. Ah, ah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You smile, at last, then."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave the smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll lose the thanks for't, ay, and throw you in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My transatlantic girl, with golden eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That draw you to her splendid whiteness as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pistil of a water-lily draws,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adust with gold. Those girls across the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are tyrannously pretty, and I swore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(She seemed to me an innocent, frank girl)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring her to you for a woman's kiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not now, but on some other day or week:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll call it perjury; I give her up."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, bring her."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now," said he, "you make it hard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch such goodness with a grimy palm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought to tease you well, and fret you cross,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And steel myself, when rightly vexed with you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For telling you a thing to tease you more."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of Romney?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no; nothing worse," he cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of Romney Leigh than what is buzzed about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he is taken in an eye-trap too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many half as wise. The thing I mean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refers to you, not him."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refers to me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He echoed, "Me! You sound it like a stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropped down a dry well very listlessly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By one who never thinks about the toad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive at the bottom. Presently perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll sound your 'me' more proudly till I shrink."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Howe's the toad, then, in this question?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll take it graver. Give me sofa-room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quiet hearing. You know Eglinton,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Eglinton, of Eglinton in Kent?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is he the toad? he's rather like the snail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known chiefly for the house upon his back:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divide the man and house you kill the man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's Eglinton of Eglinton, Lord Howe."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered grave. "A reputable man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excellent landlord of the olden stamp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If somewhat slack in new philanthropies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who keeps his birthdays with a tenants' dance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hard upon them when they miss the church
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hold their children back from catechism,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not ungentle when the agèd poor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick sticks at hedge-sides: nay, I've heard him say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The old dame has a twinge because she stoops;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's punishment enough for felony.'"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O tender-hearted landlord! may I take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My long lease with him, when the time arrives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For gathering winter-faggots!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He likes art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buys books and pictures . . . of a certain kind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neglects no patent duty; a good son" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To a most obedient mother. Born to wear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father's shoes, he wears her husband's too:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed I've heard it's touching. Dear Lord Howe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not praise me so against your heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm at worst for praise and faggots."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less bitter with me, for . . . in short," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a letter, which he urged me so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring you . . . I could scarcely choose but yield;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insisting that a new love, passing through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of an old friendship, caught from it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some reconciling odour."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love, you say?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lord, I cannot love: I only find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhyme for love, and that's not love, my lord.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take back your letter."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pause: you'll read it first?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not read it: it is stereotyped;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same he wrote to, anybody's name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Blythe the actress, when she died so true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A duchess fainted in a private box:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pauline the dancer, after the great pas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which her little feet winked overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other fire-flies, and amazed the pit:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Baldinacci, when her F in alt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had touched the silver tops of heaven itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a pungent spirit-dart, the Queen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid softly, each to each, her white-gloved palms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sighed for joy: or else (I thank your friend)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora Leigh, when some indifferent rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like those the boys sang round the holy ox
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Memphis-highway, chance perhaps to set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Apis-public lowing. Oh, he wants,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of any worthy wife at home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A star upon his stage of Eglinton?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advise him that he is not overshrewd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In being so little modest: a dropped star
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes bitter waters, says a Book I've read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there's his unread letter."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear friend,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Howe began . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In haste I tore the phrase.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean your friend of Eglinton, or me?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I mean you, you," he answered with some fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A happy life means prudent compromise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tare runs through the farmer's garnered sheaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though the gleaner's apron holds pure wheat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We count her poorer. Tare with wheat, we cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And good with drawbacks. You, you love your art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, certain of vocation, set your soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On utterance. Only, in this world we have made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(They say God made it first, but if He did
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas so long since, and, since, we have spoiled it so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scarce would know it, if He looked this way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hells we preach of, with the flames blown out),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bad, twisted, topsy-turvy world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all the heaviest wrongs get uppermost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this uneven, unfostering England here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where ledger-strokes and sword-strokes count indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soul-strokes merely tell upon the flesh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They strike from, it is hard to stand for art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless some golden tripod from the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be fished up, by Apollo's divine chance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To throne such feet as yours, my prophetess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Delphi. Think, the god comes down as fierce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As twenty bloodhounds, shakes you, strangles you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the oracular shriek shall ooze in froth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At best 'tis not all ease, at worst too hard:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place to stand on is a 'vantage gained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here's your tripod. To be plain, dear friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're poor, except in what you richly give;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You labour for your own bread painfully
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ere you pour our wine. For art's sake, pause."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered slow, as some wayfaring man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who feels himself at night too far from home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes steadfast face against the bitter wind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is art so less a thing than virtue is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That artists first must cater for their ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ever they make issue past themselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To generous use? Alas, and is it so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we, who would be somewhat clean, must sweep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ways as well as walk them, and no friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirm us nobly, 'Leave results to God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you, be clean?' What! 'prudent compromise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes acceptable life,' you say instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, you, Lord Howe? in things indifferent, well.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, compromise the wheaten bread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rye, the meat for lentils, silk for serge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleep on down, if needs, for sleep on straw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there, end compromise. I will not bate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One artist-dream on straw or down, my lord,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor pinch my liberal soul, though I be poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor cease to love high, though I live thus low."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So speaking, with less anger in my voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than sorrow, I rose quickly to depart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he, thrown back upon the noble shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such high-stumbling natures, murmured words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right words after wrong ones. Ah, the man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is worthy, but so given to entertain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible plans of superhuman life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sets his virtues on so raised a shelf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep them at the grand millennial height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to mount a stool to get at them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, meantime, lives on quite the common way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With everybody's morals.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Howe insisting that his friendly arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should oar me across the sparkling brawling stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which swept from room to room, we fell at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Lady Waldemar. "Miss Leigh," she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave me such a smile, so cold and bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she tried it in a 'tiring glass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And liked it, "all to-night I've strained at you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As babes at baubles held up out of reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By spiteful nurses ('Never snatch,' they say),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there you sat, most perfectly shut in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By good Sir Blaise and clever Mister Smith
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then our dear Lord Howe! at last indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost snatched. I have a world to speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About your cousin's place in Shropshire, where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been to see his work . . . our work, you heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went? . . . and of a letter yesterday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which if I should read a page or two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might feel interest, though you're locked of course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In literary toil. You'll like to hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your last book lies at the phalanstery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As judged innocuous for the elder girls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And younger women who still care for books.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all must read, you see, before we live,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till slowly the ineffable light comes up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as it deepens, drowns the written word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said your cousin, while we stood and felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sunset from his favourite beech-tree seat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might have been a poet if he would,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then he saw the higher thing at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And climbed to it. I think he looks well now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has quite got over that unfortunate . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ah . . . I know it moved you. Tender-heart!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You took a liking to the wretched girl.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you thought the marriage suitable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows? a poet hankers for romance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so on. As for Romney Leigh, 'tis sure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never loved her, never. By the way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have not heard of her . . .? quite out of sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of saving? lost in every sense?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She might have gone on talking half an hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I stood still, and cold, and pale, I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a garden-statue a child pelts with snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pretty pastime. Every now and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put in "yes" or "no," I scarce knew why;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blind man walks wherever the dog pulls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I answered. Till Lord Howe broke in:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What penance takes the wretch who interrupts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talk of charming women? I, at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must brave it. Pardon, Lady Waldemar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady on my arm is tired, unwell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loyally I've promised she shall say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No harder word this evening than . . .good-night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest her face speaks for her." Then we went.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I breathe large at home. I drop my cloak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unclasp my girdle, loose the band that ties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hair . . . now could I but unloose my soul!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sepulchred alive in this close world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And want more room.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charming woman there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reckoning up and writing down her talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affects me singularly. How she talked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pain me! woman's spite. You wear steel-mail:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman takes a housewife from her breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plucks the delicatest needle out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 'twere a rose, and pricks you carefully
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath nails, 'neath eyelids, in your nostrils, say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beast would roar so tortured, but a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A human creature, must not, shall not flinch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not for shame.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What vexes, after all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is just that such as she, with such as I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows how to vex. Sweet heaven, she takes me up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she had fingered me and dog-eared me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spelled me by the fireside half a life!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows my turns, my feeble points. What then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge of a thing implies the thing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, she found that in me, she saw that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her pencil underscored this for a fault,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, still ignorant. Shut the book up, close!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crush that beetle in the leaves.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last we shall grow hard too, like the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And call it self-defence because we are soft.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after all, now . . . why should I be pained
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Romney Leigh, my cousin, should espouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Lady Waldemar? And, say, she held
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her newly-blossomed gladness in my face, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas natural surely, if not generous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering how, when winter held her fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I helped the frost with mine, and pained her more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than she pains me. Pains me! but wherefore pained?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis clear my cousin Romney wants a wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, good! The man's need of the woman, here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is greater than the woman's of the man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And easier served; for where the man discerns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sex (ah, ah, the man can generalise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he), we see but one, ideally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And really: where we yearn to lose ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And melt like white pearls in another's wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seeks to double himself by what he loves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make his drink more costly by our pearls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At board, at bed, at work and holiday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not good for man to be alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's his way of thinking, first and last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus my cousin Romney wants a wife.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then my cousin sets his dignity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On personal virtue. If he understands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By love, like others, self-aggrandisement,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is that he may verily be great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing rightly and kindly. Once he thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For charitable ends set duly forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Heaven's white judgment-book, to marry . . . ah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll call her name Aurora Leigh, although
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's changed since then! and once, for social ends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Marian Erle, my sister Marian Erle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My woodland sister, sweet maid Marian,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose memory moans on in me like the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through ill-shut casements, making me more sad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than ever I find reasons for. Alas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor pretty plaintive face, embodied ghost!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finds it easy then, to clap thee off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From pulling at his sleeve and book and pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He locks thee out at night into the cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from butting with thy horny eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against his crystal dreams, that now he's strong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To love anew? that Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Succeeds my Marian?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, why not?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved not Marian, more than once he loved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora. If he loves at last that Third,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albeit she prove as slippery as spilt oil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On marble floors, I will not augur him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill-luck for that. Good love, howe'er ill-placed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is better for a man's soul in the end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That if he loved ill what deserves love well.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pagan, kissing for a step of Pan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild-goat's hoof-print on the loamy down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceeds our modern thinker who turns back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strata . . . granite, limestone, coal, and clay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concluding coldly with "Here's law! where's God?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then at worst, if Romney loves her not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At worst if he's incapable of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which may be then indeed, for such a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incapable of love, she's good enough;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she, at worst too, is a woman still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loves him . . . as the sort of woman can.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My loose long hair began to burn and creep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive to the very ends, about my knees:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swept it backward as the wind sweeps flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passion of my hands. Ah, Romney laughed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day . . . (how full the memories come up!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Your Florence fire-flies live on in your hair,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "it gleams so." Well, I wrung them out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fire-flies; made a knot as hard as life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those loose, soft, impracticable curls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then sat down and thought . . . "She shall not think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her thought of me," and drew my desk and wrote.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Lady Waldemar, I could not speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With people round me, nor can sleep to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not speak, after the great news I heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of you and of my cousin. May you be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most happy; and the good he meant the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replenish his own life. Say what I say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let my word be sweeter for your mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are you . . . I only Aurora Leigh."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's quiet, guarded: though she hold it up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the light, she'll not see through it more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than lies there to be seen. So much for pride;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now for peace, a little. Let me stop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All writing back . . . "Sweet thanks, my sweetest friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've made more joyful my great joy itself."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that's too simple! she would twist it thus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My joy would still be as sweet as thyme in drawers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However shut up in the dark and dry;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But violets, aired and dewed by love like yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-smell all thyme: we keep that in our clothes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But drop the other down our bosoms till
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They smell like " . . . ah, I see her writing back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just so. She'll make a nosegay of her words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tie it with blue ribbons at the end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suit a poet; pshaw!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we'll have
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call to church, the broken, sad, bad dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamed out at last, the marriage-vow complete
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the marriage breakfast; praying in white gloves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn off in haste for drinking pagan toasts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In somewhat stronger wine than any sipped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By gods since Bacchus had his way with grapes.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A postscript stops all that and rescues me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You need not write. I have been overworked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think of leaving London, England even,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hastening to get nearer to the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where men sleep better. So, adieu." I fold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seal, and now I'm out of all the coil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I breathe now, I spring upward like a branch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten-years school-boy with a crooked stick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May pull down to his level in search of nuts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cannot hold a moment. How we twang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back on the blue sky, and assert our height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he stares after! Now, the wonder seems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I could wrong myself by such a doubt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We poets always have uneasy hearts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because our hearts, large-rounded as the globe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can turn but one side to the sun at once.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are used to dip our artist-hands in gall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And potash, trying potentialities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of alternated colour, till at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get confused, and wonder for our skin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How nature tinged it first. Well here's the true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good flesh-colour; I recognise my hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Romney Leigh may clasp as just a friend's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep his clean.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, my Italy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, if we could ride with naked souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make no noise and pay no price at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have seen thee sooner, Italy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For still I have heard thee crying through my life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou piercing silence of ecstatic graves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men call that name!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even a witch to-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must melt down golden pieces in the nard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith to anoint her broomstick ere she rides;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poets evermore are scant of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if they find a piece behind the door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns by sunset to a withered leaf.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Devil himself scarce trusts his patented
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold-making art to any who make rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But culls his Faustus from philosophers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not from poets. "Leave my Job," said God;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the Devil leaves him without pence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poverty proves plainly special grace.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these new, just, administrative times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men clamour for an order of merit: why?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's black bread on the table and no wine!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least I am a poet in being poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God. I wonder if the manuscript
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my long poem, if 'twere sold outright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would fetch enough to buy me shoes to go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afoot (thrown in, the necessary patch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other side the Alps)? It cannot be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear that I must sell this residue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my father's books, although the Elzevirs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have fly-leaves overwritten by his hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In faded notes as thick and fine and brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As cobwebs on a tawny monument
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the old Greeks conferenda hæc cum his
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corruptè citat lege potiùs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so on, in the scholar's regal way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of giving judgment on the parts of speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he sat on all twelve thrones up-piled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arraigning Israel. Ay, but books and notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must go together. And this Proclus too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these dear quaint contracted Grecian types,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantastically crumpled like his thoughts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which would not seem too plain; you go round twice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one step forward, then you take it back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you're somewhat giddy; there's the rule
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Proclus. Ah, I stained this middle leaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pressing in't my Florence iris-bell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long stalk and all: my father chided me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that stain of blue blood, I recollect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peevish turn his voice took, "Silly girls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who plant their flowers in our philosophy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it fine, and only spoil the book!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more of it, Aurora." Yes no more!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, blame of love, that's sweeter than all praise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who love not! 'tis so lost to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot, in such beggared life, afford
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose my Proclus, not for Florence even.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kissing Judas, Wolff, shall go instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who builds us such a royal book as this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To honour a chief-poet, folio-built,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And writes above "The house of Nobody!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who floats in cream, as rich as any sucked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Juno's breasts, the broad Homeric lines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, while with their spondaic prodigious mouths
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They lap the lucent margins as babe-gods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proclaims them bastards. Wolff's an atheist:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the Iliad fell out, as he says,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mere fortuitous concourse of old songs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclude as much too for the universe.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Wolff, those Platos: sweep the upper shelves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As clean as this, and so I am almost rich,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means, not forced to think of being poor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sight of ends. To-morrow: no delay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll wait in Paris till good Carrington
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispose of such and, having chaffered for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My book's price with the publisher, direct
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All proceeds to me. Just a line to ask
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His help.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I come, my Italy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own hills! Are you 'ware of me, my hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How I burn toward you? do you feel to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The urgency and yearning of my soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sleeping mothers feel the sucking babe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smile? Nay, not so much as when in heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vain lightnings catch at your inviolate tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tremble while ye are steadfast. Still ye go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your own determined, calm, indifferent way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward sunrise, shade by shade, and light by light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the grand progression nought left out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if God verily made you for yourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would not interrupt your life with ours.

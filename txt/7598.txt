<p> They clamour and fight, they doubt and despair, they know no end to their wranglings.<br> Let your life come amongst them like a flame of light, my child, unflickering and pure, and delight them into silence.<br> They are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like hidden knives thirsting for blood.<br> Go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the evening over the strife of the day.<br> Let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning of all things; let them love you and thus love each other.<br> Come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my child. At sunrise open and raise your heart like a blossoming flower, and at sunset bend your head and in silence complete the worship of the day.</p>

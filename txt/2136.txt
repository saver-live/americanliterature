<p>I WONDER by my troth, what thou and I<br> Did, till we loved? were we not wean'd till then?<br> But suck'd on country pleasures, childishly?<br> Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers' den?<br> 'Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be;<br> If ever any beauty I did see,<br> Which I desired, and got, 'twas but a dream of thee.<br> <br> And now good-morrow to our waking souls,<br> Which watch not one another out of fear;<br> For love all love of other sights controls,<br> And makes one little room an everywhere.<br> Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone;<br> Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown;<br> Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one.<br> <br> My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,<br> And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;<br> Where can we find two better hemispheres<br> Without sharp north, without declining west?<br> Whatever dies, was not mix'd equally;<br> If our two loves be one, or thou and I<br> Love so alike that none can slacken, none can die.</p>

<p>GREEK POTTERY OF AREZZO.<br> HERE in the jealous hollow of the mould,<br> Faint, light-eluding, as templed in the breast<br> Of some rose-vaulted lotus, see the best<br> The artist had -- the vision that unrolled<br> Its flying sequence till completion's hold<br> Caught the wild round and bade the dancers rest --<br> The mortal lip on the immortal pressed<br> One instant, ere the blindness and the cold.<br> <br> And there the vase: immobile, exiled, tame,<br> The captives of fulfillment link their round,<br> Foot-heavy on the inelastic ground,<br> How different, yet how enviously the same!<br> Dishonoring the kinship that they claim,<br> As here the written word the inner sound.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I have fears that I may cease to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before high piled books, in charactry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think that I may never live to trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I shall never look upon thee more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never have relish in the faery power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of unreflecting love; then on the shore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.

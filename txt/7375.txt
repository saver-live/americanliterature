  Before she has her floor swept
    Or her dishes done,
  Any day you'll find her
    A-sunning in the sun!
  It's long after midnight
    Her key's in the lock,
  And you never see her chimney smoke
    Till past ten o'clock!
  She digs in her garden
    With a shovel and a spoon,
  She weeds her lazy lettuce
    By the light of the moon,
  She walks up the walk
    Like a woman in a dream,
  She forgets she borrowed butter
    And pays you back cream!
  Her lawn looks like a meadow,
    And if she mows the place
  She leaves the clover standing
    And the Queen Anne's lace!

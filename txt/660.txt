<p>Phoenixes that play here once, so that the place was named for them,<br> Have abandoned it now to this desolated river;<br> The paths of Wu Palace are crooked with weeds;<br> The garments of Chin are ancient dust.<br> ...Like this green horizon halving the Three Peaks,<br> Like this Island of White Egrets dividing the river,<br> A cloud has risen between the Light of Heaven and me,<br> To hide his city from my melancholy heart. <br></p>

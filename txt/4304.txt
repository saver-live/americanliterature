<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing aloof in giant ignorance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thee I hear and of the Cyclades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who sits ashore and longs perchance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To visit dolphin-coral in deep seas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thou wast blind; but then the veil was rent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee live,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Neptune made for thee a spumy tent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pan made sing for thee his forest-hive;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye on the shores of darkness there is light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And precipices show untrodden green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a budding morrow in the midnight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a triple sight in blindness keen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Dian, Queen of Earth, and Heaven, and Hell.
</pre>

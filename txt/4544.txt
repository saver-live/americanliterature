<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strife twixt man and maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh that was at the birth of time!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what befall twixt man and maid,,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh thats beyond the grip of rhyme.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twas, Sweet, I must not bide with you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love, I cannot bide alone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both were young and both were true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both were hard as the nether stone.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware the man whos crossed in love;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pent-up steam must find its vent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand back when he is on the move,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lend him all the Continent.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your patience, Sirs. The Devil took me up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the burned mountain over Sicily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Fit place for me) and thence I saw my Earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Not all Earths splendour, twas beyond my need, )
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that one spot I love, all Earth to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her I love, my Heaven. What said I?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love was safe from all the powers of Hell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you, een you, acquit her of my guilt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sula, nestling by our sail-specked sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My city, child of mine, my heart, my home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine and my pride, evil might visit there!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was for Sula and her naked port,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prey to the galleys of the Algerine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our city Sula, that I drove my price,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For love of Sula and for love of her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twain were woven, gold on sackcloth, twined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past any sundering till God shall judge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil and the good.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is not good for the Christians health to hustle the Aryan brown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Christian riles, and the Aryan smiles and he weareth the Christian down;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the end of the fight is a tombstone white with the name of the late deceased,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the epitaph drear: A Fool lies here who tried to hustle the East.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is pleasure in the wet, wet clay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the artists hand is potting it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is pleasure in the wet, wet lay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the poets pad is blotting it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is pleasure in the shine of your picture on the line
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Royal Acade-my;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pleasure felt in these is as chalk to Cheddar cheese
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to a well-made Lie.,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a quite unwreckable Lie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a most impeccable Lie!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a watertight, fire-proof, angle-iron, sunk-hinge, time-lock, steel-faced Lie!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a private hansom Lie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a pair-and-brougham Lie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a little-place-at-Tooting, but a country-house-with shooting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a ring-fence-deer-park Lie.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a lover hies abroad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for his love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azrael smiling sheathes his sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven smiles above.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth and sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His servants be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to lesser compass round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That his love be sooner found!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We meet in an evil land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is near to the gates of hell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wait for thy command
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve, to speed or withstand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou sayest, I do not well?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Love, the flowers so red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are only tongues of flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is full of the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new-killed, restless dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is danger beneath and oerhead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I guard thy gates in fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of words thou canst not hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of peril and jeopardy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of signs thou canst not see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou sayest tis ill that I came?



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I saw when the rites were done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lamps were dead and the Gods alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grey snake coiled on the altar stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere I fled from a Fear that I could not see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Gods of the East made mouths at me.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat off in our last fight were we?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater need to seek the sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fortune changeth as the moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To caravel and picaroon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Eastward Ho! or Westward Ho!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whichever wind may meetest blow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our quarry sails on either sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat prey for such bold lads as we,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every sun-dried buccaneer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must hand and reef and watch and steer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bear great wrath of sea and sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the plate-ships wallow by.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as our tall bows take the foam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let no man turn his heart to home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save to desire treasure more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And larger warehouse for his store,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When treasure won from Santos Bay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall make our sea-washed village gay.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I sought it far from men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deserts and alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it burning overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jewel of a Throne.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I sought, I sought it so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spent my days to find,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It blazed one moment ere it left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blacker night behind.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We be the Gods of the East,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older than all,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masters of Mourning and Feast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall we fall?



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they gape for the husks that ye proffer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or yearn to your song?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we, have we nothing to offer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who ruled them so long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fume of the incense, the clash of the cymbals, the blare of the conch and the gong?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the strife of the schools
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low the day burns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back with the kine from the pools
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one returns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the life that he knows where the altar-flame glows and the tulsi is trimmed in the urns.

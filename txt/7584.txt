<p> Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me--<br> "We play from the time we wake till the day ends.<br> We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.<br> I ask, "But, how am I to get up to you?" They answer, "Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds."<br> "My mother is waiting for me at home," I say. "How can I leave her and come?"<br> Then they smile and float away.<br> But I know a nicer game than that, mother.<br> I shall be the cloud and you the moon.<br> I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will be the blue sky.<br> The folk who live in the waves call out to me--<br> "We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we pass."<br> I ask, "But, how am I to join you?" They tell me, "Come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves."<br> I say, "My mother always wants me at home in the evening--how can I leave her and go?"<br> Then they smile, dance and pass by.<br> But I know a better game than that.<br> I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.<br> I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with laughter.<br> And no one in the world will know where we both are.</p>

<p>Ovid's compendium of Mythological narratives provide a staggering amount of information across a range of subjects, traditions, and customs of antiquity. He lived during the reign of Augustus, and his Books 1 - VII are presented here. We chose the 1893 edition translated by Henry T. Riley. A synopsis of each Book 1 - VII, including fable titles, is followed by all books' fables and explanations. Footnotes provided for student and instructor reference. This somewhat "dense" reading requires determination-- not for the faint of heart!</p><p><a href="synopsis-books-i-vii">SYNOPSIS - BOOKS I - VII</a></p><p><a href="book-the-first">BOOK THE FIRST</a></p><p><a href="footnotes-book-the-first">FOOTNOTES, BOOK THE FIRST</a></p><p><a href="book-the-second">BOOK THE SECOND</a></p><p><a href="footnotes-book-the-second">FOOTNOTES, BOOK THE SECOND</a></p><p><a href="book-the-third">BOOK THE THIRD</a></p><p><a href="footnotes-book-the-third">FOOTNOTES, BOOK THE THIRD</a></p><p><a href="book-the-fourth">BOOK THE FOURTH</a></p><p><a href="footnotes-book-the-fourth">FOOTNOTES, BOOK THE FOURTH</a></p><p><a href="book-the-fifth">BOOK THE FIFTH</a></p><p><a href="footnotes-book-the-fifth">FOOTNOTES, BOOK THE FIFTH</a></p><p><a href="book-the-sixth">BOOK THE SIXTH</a></p><p><a href="footnotes-book-of-sixth">FOOTNOTES, BOOK OF SIXTH</a></p><p><a href="book-the-seventh">BOOK THE SEVENTH</a></p><p><a href="footnotes-book-of-seventh">FOOTNOTES, BOOK OF SEVENTH</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/ovid">Ovid</a> library. </p>

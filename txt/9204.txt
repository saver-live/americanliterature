<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although crowds gathered once if she but showed her face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even old mens eyes grew dim, this hand alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some last courtier at a gypsy camping place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babbling of fallen majesty, records whats gone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lineaments, a heart that laughter has made sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, these remain, but I record whats gone. A crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will gather, and not know it walks the very street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud.

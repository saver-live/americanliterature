Stretched on the ground the war-worn soldier sleeps,
Beside the lurid watch fire's fitful glare;

And dreams that on the field of fame he reaps
Renown and honors which he hastes to share

With those beloved ones who gathering come,
To bid their hero husband father "wellcome home."

Fond dreamer, may thy blissful vision be
A true foreshadowing of the fates to thee.

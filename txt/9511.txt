<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all the truth is out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be secret and take defeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From any brazen throat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how can you compete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being honour bred, with one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, were it proved he lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were neither shamed in his own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor in his neighboursÂ’ eyes?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bred to a harder thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Triumph, turn away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like a laughing string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon mad fingers play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid a place of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be secret and exult,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all things known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is most difficult

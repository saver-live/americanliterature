<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the Poets, unto whom belong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Olympian heights; whose singing shafts were sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight to the mark, and not from bows half bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the utmost tension of the thong?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the stately argosies of song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose rushing keels made music as they went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing in search of some new continent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all sail set, and steady winds and strong?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps there lives some dreamy boy, untaught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In schools, some graduate of the field or street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall become a master of the art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An admiral sailing the high seas of thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearless and first and steering with his fleet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For lands not yet laid down in any chart.

<pre>Devereux Farm, Near Marblehead

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat within the farm-house old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose windows, looking o'er the bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave to the sea-breeze, damp and cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An easy entrance, night and day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away we saw the port,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange, old-fashioned, silent town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lighthouse, the dismantled fort,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden houses, quaint and brown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat and talked until the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending, filled the little room;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our faces faded from the sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our voices only broke the gloom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spake of many a vanished scene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what we once had thought and said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what had been, and might have been,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who was changed, and who was dead;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that fills the hearts of friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first they feel, with secret pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lives thenceforth have separate ends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never can be one again;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first slight swerving of the heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That words are powerless to express,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave it still unsaid in part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or say it in too great excess.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very tones in which we spake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had something strange, I could but mark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves of memory seemed to make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mournful rustling in the dark.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft died the words upon our lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As suddenly, from out the fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built of the wreck of stranded ships,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames would leap and then expire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as their splendor flashed and failed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thought of wrecks upon the main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ships dismasted, that were hailed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sent no answer back again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows, rattling in their frames,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean, roaring up the beach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gusty blast, the bickering flames,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mingled vaguely in our speech.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until they made themselves a part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fancies floating through the brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-lost ventures of the heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That send no answers back again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O flames that glowed!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O hearts that yearned!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were indeed too much akin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drift-wood fire without that burned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts that burned and glowed within.

<p>Sons of the South, awake! arise!<br> Sons of the South, and do.<br> Banish from under your bonny skies<br> Those old-world errors and wrongs and lies.<br> Making a hell in a Paradise<br> That belongs to your sons and you.<br> <br> Sons of the South, make choice between<br> (Sons of the South, choose true),<br> The Land of Morn and the Land of E'en,<br> The Old Dead Tree and the Young Tree Green,<br> The Land that belongs to the lord and the Queen,<br> And the Land that belongs to you.<br> <br> Sons of the South, your time will come –<br> Sons of the South, 'tis near –<br> The "Signs of the Times", in their language dumb,<br> Fortell it, and ominous whispers hum<br> Like sullen sounds of a distant drum,<br> In the ominous atmosphere.<br> <br> Sons of the South, aroused at last!<br> Sons of the South are few!<br> But your ranks grow longer and deeper fast,<br> And ye shall swell to an army vast,<br> And free from the wrongs of the North and Past<br> The land that belongs to you.</p>

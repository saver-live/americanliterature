<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light human nature is too lightly tost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ruffled without cause, complaining on 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restless with rest, until, being overthrown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It learneth to lie quiet. Let a frost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a small wasp have crept to the inner-most
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our ripe peach, or let the wilful sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shine westward of our window, straight we run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A furlong's sigh as if the world were lost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what time through the heart and through the brain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God hath transfixed us, we, so moved before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attain to a calm. Ay, shouldering weights of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We anchor in deep waters, safe from shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear submissive o'er the stormy main
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's chartered judgments walk for evermore.
</pre>

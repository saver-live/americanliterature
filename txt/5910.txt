<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God sent his Singers upon earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With songs of sadness and of mirth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they might touch the hearts of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring them back to heaven again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, a youth, with soul of fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held in his hand a golden lyre;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through groves he wandered, and by streams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing the music of our dreams.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, with a bearded face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood singing in the market-place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stirred with accents deep and loud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearts of all the listening crowd.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray old man, the third and last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang in cathedrals dim and vast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the majestic organ rolled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrition from its mouths of gold.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who heard the Singers three
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disputed which the best might be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For still their music seemed to start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discordant echoes in each heart,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the great Master said, "I see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No best in kind, but in degree;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a various gift to each,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To charm, to strengthen, and to teach.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are the three great chords of might,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he whose ear is tuned aright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will hear no discord in the three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most perfect harmony."

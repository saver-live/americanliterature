<p> Hence Burgundy, Claret, and Port, <br> Away with old Hock and madeira, <br> Too earthly ye are for my sport; <br> There's a beverage brighter and clearer. <br> Instead of a piriful rummer, <br> My wine overbrims a whole summer; <br> My bowl is the sky, <br> And I drink at my eye, <br> Till I feel in the brain <br> A Delphian pain - <br> Then follow, my Caius! then follow: <br> On the green of the hill <br> We will drink our fill <br> Of golden sunshine, <br> Till our brains intertwine <br> With the glory and grace of Apollo! <br> God of the Meridian, <br> And of the East and West, <br> To thee my soul is flown, <br> And my body is earthward press'd. - <br> It is an awful mission, <br> A terrible division; <br> And leaves a gulph austere <br> To be fill'd with worldly fear. <br> Aye, when the soul is fled <br> To high above our head, <br> Affrighted do we gaze <br> After its airy maze, <br> As doth a mother wild, <br> When her young infant child <br> Is in an eagle's claws - <br> And is not this the cause <br> Of madness? - God of Song, <br> Thou bearest me along <br> Through sights I scarce can bear: <br> O let me, let me share <br> With the hot lyre and thee, <br> The staid Philosophy. <br> Temper my lonely hours, <br> And let me see thy bowers <br> More unalarm'd! <br> </p>

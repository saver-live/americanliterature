<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may have blamed you that you took away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The verses that could move them on the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lightning you went from me, and I could find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to make a song about but kings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That were like memories of you, but now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well out, for the world lives as long ago;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while were in our laughing, weeping fit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone.

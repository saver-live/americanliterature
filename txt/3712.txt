<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sloe was lost in flower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The April elm was dim;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the lovers hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour for lies and him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thorns are all the bower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If north winds freeze the fir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, tis anothers hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour for truth and her.

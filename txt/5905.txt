<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up soared the lark into the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shaft of song, a winged prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a soul, released from pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were flying back to heaven again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Francis heard; it was to him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An emblem of the Seraphim;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upward motion of the fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light, the heat, the heart's desire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around Assisi's convent gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds, God's poor who cannot wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From moor and mere and darksome wood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came flocking for their dole of food.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O brother birds," St. Francis said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye come to me and ask for bread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not with bread alone to-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall ye be fed and sent away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye shall be fed, ye happy birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With manna of celestial words;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not mine, though mine they seem to be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not mine, though they be spoken through me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, doubly are ye bound to praise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great Creator in your lays;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He giveth you your plumes of down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your crimson hoods, your cloaks of brown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He giveth you your wings to fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathe a purer air on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And careth for you everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who for yourselves so little care!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flutter of swift wings and songs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together rose the feathered throngs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And singing scattered far apart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep peace was in St. Francis' heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew not if the brotherhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His homily had understood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only knew that to one ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of his words was clear.

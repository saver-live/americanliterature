&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What need you, being come to sense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fumble in a greasy till
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And add the halfpence to the pence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prayer to shivering prayer, until
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have dried the marrow from the bone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For men were born to pray and save:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's with O'Leary in the grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet they were of a different kind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names that stilled your childish play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have gone about the world like wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But little time had they to pray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whom the hangman's rope was spun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what, God help us, could they save:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's with O'Leary in the grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it for this the wild geese spread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey wing upon every tide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this that all that blood was shed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this Edward Fitzgerald died,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that delirium of the brave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's with O'Leary in the grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet could we turn the years again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And call those exiles as they were,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all their loneliness and pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd cry Some woman's yellow hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has maddened every mother's son:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They weighed so lightly what they gave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let them be, they're dead and gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're with O'Leary in the grave.

LORD God, Who let Your baby son
  Pass earthward where the joys were few
To a hard death when all was done,
  And very far away from You;

My little lad must go today
  Paths where I cannot guide his feet,
Through dangers that I cannot stay
  To strife I cannot help him meet;

He has heard voices calling him
  Though youth is gay and life is warm,
And right seems far away and dim,
  To weary ways and battle-storm:

Lord God, Whose Son went steadily
  Down the hard road He had to tread,
Guard my son too, that he may be
  Strong in his hours of doubt and dread!

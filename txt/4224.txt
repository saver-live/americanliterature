<pre>I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is to weet a melancholy carle:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin in the waist, with bushy head of hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hath the seeded thistle when in parle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It holds the Zephyr, ere it sendeth fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its light balloons into the summer air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therto his beard had not begun to bloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No brush had touch'd his chin or razor sheer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No care had touch'd his cheek with mortal doom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But new he was and bright as scarf from Persian loom.

II.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne cared he for wine, or half-and-half;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne cared he for fish or flesh or fowl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sauces held he worthless as the chaff,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 'sdeigned the swine-head at the wassail-bowl;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne with lewd ribbalds sat he cheek by jowl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne with sly Lemans in the scorner's chair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after water-brooks this Pilgrim's soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panted, and all his food was woodland air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he would oft-times feast on gilliflowers rare.

III.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slang of cities in no wise he knew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tipping the wink to him was heathen Greek;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sipp'd no olden Tom or ruin blue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or nantz or cherry-brandy drank full meek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By many a damsel hoarse and rouge of cheek;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did he know each aged watchman's beat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor in obscured purlieus would he seek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For curled Jewesses with ankles neat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who as they walk abroad make tinkling with their feet.

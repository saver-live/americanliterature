&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush, hush! tread softly! hush, hush my dear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the house is asleep, but we know very well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the jealous, the jealous old bald-pate may hear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' you've padded his night-cap O sweet Isabel!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' your feet are more light than a Fairy's feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dances on bubbles where brooklets meet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush, hush! soft tiptoe! hush, hush my dear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For less than a nothing the jealous can hear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No leaf doth tremble, no ripple is there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the river, all's still, and the night's sleepy eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closes up, and forgets all its Lethean care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charm'd to death by the drone of the humming May-fly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Moon, whether prudish or complaisant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath fled to her bower, well knowing I want
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No light in the dusk, no torch in the gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my Isabel's eyes, and her lips pulp'd with bloom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift the latch! ah gently! ah tenderly sweet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dead if that latchet gives one little chink!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done now those lips, and a flowery seat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man may sleep, and the planets may wink;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shut rose shall dream of our loves, and awake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full blown, and such warmth for the morning's take;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock-dove shall hatch her soft brace and shall coo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I kiss to the melody, aching all through!

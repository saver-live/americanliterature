&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jelaludin Muhammed Akbar, Guardian of Mankind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved his standards out of Delhi to Jaunpore of lower Hind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a mosque was to be builded, and a lovelier neer was planned;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Munim Khan, his Viceroy, slid the drawings neath his hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(High as Hope upsheered her towers to the promised Heavens above.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep as Faith and dark as Judgment her unplumbed foundations dove.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide as Mercy, white as moonlight, stretched her fore courts to the dawn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Akbar gave commandment, Let it rise as it is drawn.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he wearied, the mood moving, of the men and things he ruled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he walked beside the Goomti while the flaming sunset cooled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply, without mark or ensign, singly, without guard or guide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he heard an angry woman screeching by the riverside.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twas the Widow of the Potter, a virago feared and known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In haste to cross the ferry, but the ferry-man had gone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she cursed him and his office, and hearing Akbars tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(She was very old and darkling) turned her wrath upon his head.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he answered, being Akbar, Suffer me to scull you oer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called her Mother, stowed her bundles, worked the clumsy scow from shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they grounded on a sand-bank, and the Widow loosed her mind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stars stole out and chuckled at the Guardian of Mankind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, most impotent of bunglers! Oh, my daughters daughters brood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting hungry on the threshold for I cannot bring their food,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till a fool has learned his business at their virtuous grandams cost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a greater fool, our Viceroy, trifles while her name is lost!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Munim Khan, that Sire of Asses, sees me daily come and go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it suits a drunken boatman, or this ox who cannot row.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Munim Khan, the Owls Own Uncle, Munim Khan, the Capons seed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must build a mosque to Allah when a bridge is all we need!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty years I eat oppression and extortion and delays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snake and crocodile and fever, flood and drouth, beset my ways.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Munim Khan must tax us for his mosque whateer befall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allah knowing (May He hear me!) that a bridge would save us all!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she stormed that other laboured and, when they touched the shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing brought her on his shoulder to her hovels very door.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his mirth renewed her anger, for she thought he mocked the weak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she scored him with her talons, drawing blood on either cheek. . . .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jelaludin Muhammed Akbar, Guardian of Mankind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoke with Munim Khan his Viceroy, ere the midnight stars declined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girt and sworded, robed and jewelled, but, on either cheek appeared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four shameless scratches running from the turban to the beard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allah burn all Potters Widows! Yet, since this same night was young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has shown me by sure token, there was wisdom on her tongue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I ferried her for hire. Yes, he pointed, I was paid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he told the tale rehearsing all the Widow did and said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he ended, Sire of Asses, Capon, Owls Own Uncle, know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, most impotent of bunglers, I, this ox who cannot row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, Jelaludin Muhammed Akbar, Guardian of Mankind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bid thee build the hag her bridge and put our mosque from out thy mind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So twas built, and Allah blessed it; and, through earthquake, flood, and sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the bridge his Viceroy builded throws her arch oer Akbars Ford!

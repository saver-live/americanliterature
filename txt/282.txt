<p>Why pretend to be<br> Now breeze, now stone, now a bird?<br> Why smile at me,<br> In sudden lightning from summer's sky?<br> <br> Don't torture me further, and don't touch me!<br> Leave me to my prophetic dreamsâ€¦<br> A drunken flame reels<br> Over the dry grey marshes.<br> <br> And the Muse in a ragged shawl,<br> Sings a long despondent song,<br> With a harsh youthful yearning,<br> With her miraculous strength.<br></p>

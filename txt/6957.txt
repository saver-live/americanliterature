<p>Perhaps the oldest horror short story featured at American Literature, <span class="al-title">The Vampyre</span> is considered the first in a genre which became known as romantic vampire gothic fiction. Lord Ruthven is the original seductive vampire character, a precursor to blood-thirsty romantic vampire heart-throbs like <span class="al-title">Twilight</span>'s Edward Cullen, etc.</p><p>Interesting fact: <span class="al-title">The Vampyre</span> was first published in 1819 in the <span class="al-periodical">New Monthly Magazine</span> with the false attribution <i>A Tale by Lord Byron</i> since Polidori includes an account of his travels with Lord Byron. Its true authorship was later corrected. Polidori's groundbreaking seductive story inspired numerous vampire-themed works, including the 1945 movie <span class="al-title">The Vampire's Ghost</span>, with the Lord Ruthven character changed to "Webb Fallon" and set in Africa.</p><p>In 1992, the BBC broadcast <span class="al-title">The Vampyr: A Soap Opera</span> which was based on the German opera <span class="al-title">Der Vampyr</span> by Heinrich Marschner. The vampire, disguised as a successful businessman named "Ripley" was revived after being frozen since the late eighteenth century.</p><p>This novel's original title was <span class="al-title">The Vampyre; A Tale</span>. </p><p><a href="extract-of-a-letter-from-geneva">Extract of a Letter from Geneva</a></p><p><a href="the-vampyre-introduction">The Vampyre -- Introduction</a></p><p><a href="the-vampyre">The Vampyre</a></p><p><a href="extract-of-a-letter-containing-an-account-of-lord-byrons-residence-in-the-island-of-mitylene">Extract of a Letter Containing an Account of Lord Byron's Residence in the Island of Mitylene</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/john-william-polidori">John William Polidori</a> library. </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Rose! who dares to name thee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer roseate now, nor soft, nor sweet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But pale, and hard, and dry, as stubble-wheat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept seven years in a drawer, thy titles shame thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze that used to blow thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the hedgerow thorns, and take away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An odour up the lane to last all day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If breathing now, unsweetened would forego thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun that used to smite thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mix his glory in thy gorgeous urn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till beam appeared to bloom, and flower to burn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If shining now, with not a hue would light thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dew that used to wet thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, white first, grow incarnadined, because
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lay upon thee where the crimson was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If dropping now, would darken where it met thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fly that lit upon thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stretch the tendrils of its tiny feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along thy leaf's pure edges, after heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If lighting now, would coldly overrun thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bee that once did suck thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And build thy perfumed ambers up his hive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swoon in thee for joy, till scarce alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If passing now, would blindly overlook thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart doth recognise thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, alone! The heart doth smell thee sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth view thee fair, doth judge thee most complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though seeing now those changes that disguise thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, and the heart doth owe thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More love, dead rose! than to such roses bold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Julia wears at dances, smiling cold!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie still upon this heart which breaks below thee!

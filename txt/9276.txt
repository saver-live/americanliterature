<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now must I these three praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three women that have wrought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What joy is in my days;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One that no passing thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor those unpassing cares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not in these fifteen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times troubled years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could ever come between
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart and delighted heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one because her hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had strength that could unbind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What none can understand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What none can have and thrive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youths dreamy load, till she
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So changed me that I live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labouring in ecstasy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what of her that took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All till my youth was gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With scarce a pitying look?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could I praise that one?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When day begins to break
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I count my good and bad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being wakeful for her sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering what she had,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What eagle look still shows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While up from my hearts root
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So great a sweetness flows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shake from head to foot.

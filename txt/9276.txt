<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indignant at the fumbling wits, the obscure spite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our old Paudeen in his shop, I stumbled blind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the stones and thorn trees, under morning light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a curlew cried and in the luminous wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A curlew answered; and suddenly thereupon I thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That on the lonely height where all are in GodÂ’s eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There cannot be, confusion of our sound forgot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single soul that lacks a sweet crystaline cry.

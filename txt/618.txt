<p>"Bathed in fragrance,<br> do not brush your hat;<br> Washed in perfume,<br> do not shake your coat:<br> <br> "Knowing the world<br> fears what is too pure,<br> The wisest man<br> prizes and stores light!"<br> <br> By Bluewater<br> an old angler sat:<br> You and I together,<br> Let us go home. <br></p>

To a Lady weeping.


Weep, daughter of a royal line,
﻿A Sire's disgrace, a realm's decay;
Ah, happy! if each tear of thine
﻿Could wash a father's fault away!

Weep—for thy tears are Virtue's tears—
﻿Auspicious to these suffering isles;
And be each drop in future years
﻿Repaid thee by thy people's smiles!

March, 1812.

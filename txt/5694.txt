&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lovely morning, without the glare of the sun, the sea in great commotion, chafing and foaming.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the bosom of darkness our days come roaring and gleaming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chafe and break into foam, sink into darkness again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the shores of Time each leaves some trace of its passage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the succeeding wave washes it out from the sand.

<p>How I loved, and love, to look<br> At your chained shores,<br> At the balconies on which centuries<br> Never set foot.<br> And you are truly the capital,<br> For we who are mad and luminous;<br> But when those pure and special hours<br> Linger above the Neva,<br> And the wind in May sweeps round<br> The columns that edge the water,<br> You are like a sinner seeing, before death,<br> A sweetest dream of paradise.</p>

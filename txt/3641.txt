<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked alone and thinking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faint the nightwind blew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stirred on mounds at crossways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower of sinners rue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the roads part they bury
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him that his own hand slays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the weed of sorrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs at the four cross ways.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By night I plucked it hueless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When morning broke twas blue:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue at my breast I fastened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower of sinners rue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed a herb of healing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A balsam and a sign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower of a heart whose trouble
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must have been worse than mine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead clay that did me kindness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can do none to you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only wear for breastknot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower of sinners rue.

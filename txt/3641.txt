<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time you won your town the race
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We chaired you through the market-place;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man and boy stood cheering by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And home we brought you shoulder-high.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day, the road all runners come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoulder-high we bring you home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set you at your threshold down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Townsman of a stiller town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart lad, to slip betimes away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From fields where glory does not stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And early though the laurel grows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It withers quicker than the rose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes the shady night has shut
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot see the record cut,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silence sounds no worse than cheers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After earth has stopped the ears:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you will not swell the rout
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lads that wore their honours out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runners whom renown outran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the name died before the man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So set, before its echoes fade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet foot on the sill of shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold to the low lintel up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The still-defended challenge-cup.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And round that early-laurelled head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And find unwithered on its curls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garland briefer than a girl's.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour wine and dance if Manhood still have pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring roses if the rose be yet in bloom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cataract smokes upon the mountain side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull down the blinds, bring fiddle and clarionet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That there be no foot silent in the room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor mouth from kissing, nor from wine unwet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain, in vain; the cataract still cries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The everlasting taper lights the gloom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All wisdom shut into his onyx eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Father Rosicross sleeps in his tomb.

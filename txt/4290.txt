<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft have you seen a swan superbly frowning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with proud breast his own white shadow crowning;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slants his neck beneath the waters bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So silently, it seems a beam of light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come from the galaxy: anon he sports,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With outspread wings the Naiad Zephyr courts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ruffles all the surface of the lake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In striving from its crystal face to take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some diamond water drops, and them to treasure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In milky nest, and sip them off at leisure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not a moment can he there insure them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor to such downy rest can he allure them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For down they rush as though they would be free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drop like hours into eternity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like that bird am I in loss of time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whene'er I venture on the stream of rhyme;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With shatter'd boat, oar snapt, and canvass rent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slowly sail, scarce knowing my intent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still scooping up the water with my fingers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which a trembling diamond never lingers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this, friend Charles, you may full plainly see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why I have never pennd a line to thee:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because my thoughts were never free, and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And little fit to please a classic ear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because my wine was of too poor a savour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sparkling Helicon: small good it were
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take him to a desert rude, and bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had on Baiae's shore reclin'd at ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Tasso's page was floating in a breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gave soft music from Armida's bowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small good to one who had by Mulla's stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had beheld Belphoebe in a brook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lovely Una in a leafy nook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Archimago leaning o'er his book:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had of all that's sweet tasted, and seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From silv'ry ripple, up to beauty's queen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sequester'd haunts of gay Titania,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the blue dwelling of divine Urania:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, who, of late, had ta'en sweet forest walks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him who elegantly chats, and talks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrong'd Libertas, who has told you stories
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of laurel chaplets, and Apollos glories;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of troops chivalrous prancing through a city,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tearful ladies made for love, and pity:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many else which I have never known.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus have I thought; and days on days have flown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, or rapidly unwilling still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you to try my dull, unlearned quill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor should I now, but that I've known you long;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you first taught me all the sweets of song:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand, the sweet, the terse, the free, the fine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What swell'd with pathos, and what right divine:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spenserian vowels that elope with ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And float along like birds o'er summer seas;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miltonian storms, and more, Miltonian tenderness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael in arms, and more, meek Eves fair slenderness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to its climax and then dying proudly?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who found for me the grandeur of the ode,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing, like Atlas, stronger from its load?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who let me taste that more than cordial dram,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp, the rapier-pointed epigram?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shew'd me that epic was of all the king,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round, vast, and spanning all like Saturn's ring?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You too upheld the veil from Clio's beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pointed out the patriot's stern duty;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The might of Alfred, and the shaft of Tell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Brutus, that so grandly fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a tyrant's head. Ah! had I never seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or known your kindness, what might I have been?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What my enjoyments in my youthful years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereft of all that now my life endears?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can I e'er these benefits forget?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can I e'er repay the friendly debt?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, doubly no; yet should these rhymings please,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall roll on the grass with two-fold ease:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have long time been my fancy feeding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hopes that you would one day think the reading
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my rough verses not an hour mis[s]pent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should it e'er be so, what a rich content!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some weeks have pass'd since last I saw the spires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lucent Thames reflected:warm desires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the sun o'er peep the eastern dimness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And morning shadows streaking into slimness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the lawny fields, and pebbly water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mark the time as they grow broad, and shorter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel the air that plays about the hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sips its freshness from the little rills;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see high, golden corn wave in the light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Cynthia smiles upon a summer's night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And peers among the cloudlet's jet and white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though she were reclining in a bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bean blossoms, in heaven freshly shed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner had I stepp'd into these pleasures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I began to think of rhymes and measures:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air that floated by me seemd to say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Write! thou wilt never have a better day."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I did. When many lines Id written,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though with their grace I was not oversmitten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as my hand was warm, I thought Id better
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust to my feelings, and write you a letter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an attempt required an inspiration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a peculiar sort, a consummation;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, had I felt, these scribblings might have been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verses from which the soul would never wean:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But many days have past since last my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was warmd luxuriously by divine Mozart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Arne delighted, or by Handel madden'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by the song of Erin piercd and sadden'd:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time you were before the music sitting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rich notes to each sensation fitting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have walk'd with you through shady lanes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That freshly terminate in open plains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And revel'd in a chat that ceased not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at night-fall among your books we got:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, nor when supper came, nor after that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor when reluctantly I took my hat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, nor till cordially you shook my hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid-way between our homes: your accents bland
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still sounded in my ears, when I no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could hear your footsteps touch the gravly floor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I lost them, and then found again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You chang'd the footpath for the grassy plain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those still moments I have wish'd you joys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That well you know to honour: "Life's very toys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With him," said I, "will take a pleasant charm;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It cannot be that ought will work him harm."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thoughts now come oer me with all their might:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I shake your hand, friend Charles, good night.

<p>Australia's a big country<br> An' Freedom's humping bluey,<br> An' Freedom's on the wallaby<br> Oh! don't you hear 'er cooey?<br> She's just begun to boomerang,<br> She'll knock the tyrants silly,<br> She's goin' to light another fire<br> And boil another billy.</p>
<p>Our fathers toiled for bitter bread<br> While loafers thrived beside 'em,<br> But food to eat and clothes to wear,<br> Their native land denied 'em.<br> An' so they left their native land<br> In spite of their devotion,<br> An' so they came, or if they stole,<br> Were sent across the ocean.</p>
<p>Then Freedom couldn't stand the glare<br> O' Royalty's regalia,<br> She left the loafers where they were,<br> An' came out to Australia.<br> But now across the mighty main<br> The chains have come ter bind her –<br> She little thought to see again<br> The wrongs she left behind her.</p>
<p>Our parents toil'd to make a home –<br> Hard grubbin 'twas an' clearin' –<br> They wasn't crowded much with lords<br> When they was pioneering.<br> But now that we have made the land<br> A garden full of promise,<br> Old Greed must crook 'is dirty hand<br> And come ter take it from us.</p>
<p>So we must fly a rebel flag,<br> As others did before us,<br> And we must sing a rebel song<br> And join in rebel chorus.<br> We'll make the tyrants feel the sting<br> O' those that they would throttle;<br> They needn't say the fault is ours<br> If blood should stain the wattle!</p>

<p>Two men were traveling in company along the road when one of them picked up a well-filled purse.</p><p>"How lucky I am!" he said. "I have found a purse. Judging by its weight it must be full of gold."</p><p>"Do not say '<i>I</i> have found a purse,'" said his companion. "Say rather '<i>we</i> have found a purse' and 'how lucky <i>we</i> are.' Travelers ought to share alike the fortunes or misfortunes of the road."</p><p>"No, no," replied the other angrily. "<i>I</i> found it and <i>I</i> am going to keep it."</p><p>Just then they heard a shout of "Stop, thief!" and looking around, saw a mob of people armed with clubs coming down the road.</p><p>The man who had found the purse fell into a panic.</p><p>"We are lost if they find the purse on us," he cried.</p><p>"No, no," replied the other, "You would not say 'we' before, so now stick to your 'I'. Say '<i>I</i> am lost.'"</p><p class="center"><i>We cannot expect any one to share our misfortunes unless we are willing to share our good fortune also.</i></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MOTHER'S GHOST

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Svend Dyring he rideth adown the glade;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself was young!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he hath wooed him so winsome a maid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair words gladden so many a heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together were they for seven years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And together children six were theirs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came Death abroad through the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blighted the beautiful lily-wand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Svend Dyring he rideth adown the glade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again hath he wooed him another maid,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath wooed him a maid and brought home a bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was bitter and full of pride.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came driving into the yard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the six children weeping so hard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the small children with sorrowful heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From before her feet she thrust them apart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave to them neither ale nor bread;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye shall suffer hunger and hate," she said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took from them their quilts of blue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "Ye shall lie on the straw we strew."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took from them the great waxlight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now ye shall lie in the dark at night."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening late they cried with cold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother heard it under the mould.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman heard it the earth below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To my little children I must go."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She standeth before the Lord of all:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And may I go to my children small?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She prayed him so long, and would not cease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he bade her depart in peace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At cock-crow thou shalt return again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longer thou shalt not there remain!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She girded up her sorrowful bones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rifted the walls and the marble stones.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As through the village she flitted by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watch-dogs howled aloud to the sky.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came to the castle gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood her eldest daughter in wait.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why standest thou here, dear daughter mine?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How fares it with brothers and sisters thine?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never art thou mother of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my mother was both fair and fine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother was white, with cheeks of red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou art pale, and like to the dead."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How should I be fair and fine?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been dead; pale cheeks are mine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How should I be white and red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long, so long have I been dead?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came in at the chamber door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the small children weeping sore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One she braided, another she brushed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third she lifted, the fourth she hushed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth she took on her lap and pressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she would suckle it at her breast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to her eldest daughter said she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do thou bid Svend Dyring come hither to me."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the chamber when he came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spake to him in anger and shame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left behind me both ale and bread;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children hunger and are not fed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left behind me quilts of blue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children lie on the straw ye strew.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left behind me the great waxlight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children lie in the dark at night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I come again unto your hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As cruel a fate shall you befall!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now crows the cock with feathers red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the earth must all the dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now crows the cock with feathers swart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of heaven fly wide apart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now crows the cock with feathers white;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can abide no longer to-night."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever they heard the watch-dogs wail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gave the children bread and ale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever they heard the watch-dogs bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feared lest the dead were on their way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever they heard the watch-dogs bark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself was young!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feared the dead out there in the dark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair words gladden so many a heart.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched by the pathos of these rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian said: "All praise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be to the ballads of old times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the bards of simple ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who walked with Nature hand in hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose country was their Holy Land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose singing robes were homespun brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From looms of their own native town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which they were not ashamed to wear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not of silk or sendal gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor decked with fanciful array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cockle-shells from Outre-Mer."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the Student answered: "Yes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All praise and honor!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I confess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bread and ale, home-baked, home-brewed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are wholesome and nutritious food,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not enough for all our needs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poets--the best of them--are birds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of passage; where their instinct leads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They range abroad for thoughts and words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from all climes bring home the seeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That germinate in flowers or weeds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not fowls in barnyards born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cackle o'er a grain of corn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if you shut the horizon down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the small limits of their town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you but degrade your bard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he at last becomes as one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thinks the all-encircling sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rises and sets in his back yard?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian said again:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be so; yet I maintain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That what is native still is best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And little care I for the rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is a long story; time would fail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell it, and the hour is late;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not waste it in debate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But listen to our Landlord's tale."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus the sword of Damocles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending not by slow degrees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly, on the Landlord fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who blushing, and with much demur
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many vain apologies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plucking up heart, began to tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rhyme of one Sir Christopher.

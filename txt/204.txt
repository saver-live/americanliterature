<p>I.<br> <br> Horses along the ride,<br> Long waves of combed manes.<br> O enchanting town of enigmas,<br> I'm sad. I'm in love with you.<br> <br> Strange to recall soul's longing,<br> Suffocating, delirious death.<br> Now I'm simply a plaything,<br> Like the green parrot, my friend.<br> <br> If you wish to, look in my eyes;<br> There's no hint of pain in my heart;<br> But I dislike the hour before sunset;<br> Wind from the sea; the word 'depart'.<br> <br> II.<br> <br> And then…there's my marble double,<br> Lying under the ancient maple,<br> Giving his face to the waters,<br> Listening to rustling leaves.<br> <br> While a bright rain laves<br> His clotted wound…<br> Cold one, white one, wait,<br> I'll turn to marble too.<br> <br> III - Pushkin<br> <br> Dark-complexioned, he wandered these alleys,<br> Was sorrowful on this lake shore,<br> And a century later we cherish,<br> The faint stir of his footsteps.<br> <br> A litter of pine needles,<br> Low stumps, a dense bristling mat…<br> Here lay his dog-eared copy of Parny,<br> And here, his tricorn hat.<br></p>

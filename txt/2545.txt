A neighbor of mine in the village
Likes to tell how one spring
When she was a girl on the farm, she did
A childlike thing.
 
One day she asked her father
To give her a garden plot
To plant and tend and reap herself,
And he said, “Why not?”
 
In casting about for a corner
He thought of an idle bit
Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood,
And he said, “Just it.”
 
And he said, “That ought to make you
An ideal one-girl farm,
And give you a chance to put some strength
On your slim-jim arm.”
 
It was not enough of a garden,
Her father said, to plough;
So she had to work it all by hand,
But she don’t mind now.
 
She wheeled the dung in the wheelbarrow
Along a stretch of road;
But she always ran away and left
Her not-nice load.
 
And hid from anyone passing.
And then she begged the seed.
She says she thinks she planted one
Of all things but weed.
 
A hill each of potatoes,
Radishes, lettuce, peas,
Tomatoes, beets, beans, pumpkins, corn,
And even fruit trees.
 
And yes, she has long mistrusted
That a cider apple tree
In bearing there to-day is hers,
Or at least may be.
 
Her crop was a miscellany
When all was said and done,
A little bit of everything,
A great deal of none.
 
Now when she sees in the village
How village things go,
Just when it seems to come in right,
She says, “I know!
 
It’s as when I was a farmer–––”
Oh, never by way of advice!
And she never sins by telling the tale
To the same person twice.

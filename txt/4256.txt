<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nymph of the downward smile and sidelong glance!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what diviner moments of the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou most lovely? when gone far astray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the labyrinths of sweet utterance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or when serenely wandering in a trance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sober thought? Or when starting away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With careless robe to meet the morning ray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou sparest the flowers in thy mazy dance?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haply 'tis when thy ruby lips part sweetly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so remain, because thou listenest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou to please wert nurtured so completely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I can never tell what mood is best;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall as soon pronounce which Grace more neatly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trips it before Apollo than the rest.
</pre>

<p> O you shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond, have you forgotten the little child, like the birds that have nested in your branches and left you?<br> Do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at the tangle of your roots that plunged underground?<br> The women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling to wake up.<br> Sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles weaving golden tapestry.<br> Two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and the child would sit still and think.<br> He longed to be the wind and blow through your rustling branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water, to be a bird and perch on your top-most twig, and to float like those ducks among the weeds and shadows.</p>

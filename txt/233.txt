<p>I'll erase this day from your memory,<br> So your vague helpless gaze will ask<br> Where you saw Persian lilac,<br> Swallows, and this wooden house.<br> <br> Oh, how often you'll remember<br> The sudden pain of unnamed longing,<br> And in townships seek in dream<br> For a street that isn't on the map!<br> <br> At the sight of every chance letter,<br> When a voice sounds from an open door,<br> You'll think: 'It's she, who's here<br> Bringing help to the non-believer.'<br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood, and heard the steeple
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinkle the quarters on the morning town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, two, three, four, to market-place and people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tossed them down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strapped, noosed, nighing his hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood and counted them and cursed his luck;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the clock collected in the tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its strength, and struck.

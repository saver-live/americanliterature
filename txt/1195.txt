<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he sleepeth! having drunken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary childhood's mandragore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his pretty eyes have sunken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasures, to make room for more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeping near the withered nosegay, which he pulled the day before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nosegays! leave them for the waking:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throw them earthward where they grew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim are such, beside the breaking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amaranths he looks unto
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folded eyes see brighter colours than the open ever do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven-flowers, rayed by shadows golden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the paths they sprang beneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now perhaps divinely holden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swing against him in a wreath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may think so from the quickening of his bloom and of his breath.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision unto vision calleth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the young child dreameth on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair, O dreamer, thee befalleth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the glory thou hast won!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darker wert thou in the garden, yestermorn, by summer sun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should see the spirits ringing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round thee, were the clouds away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis the child-heart draws them, singing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent-seeming clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing! Stars that seem the mutest, go in music all the way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the moths around a taper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the bees around a rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the gnats around a vapour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Spirits group and close
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about a holy childhood, as if drinking its repose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapes of brightness overlean thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash their diadems of youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ringlets which half screen thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While thou smilest, . . . not in sooth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy smile . . . but the overfair one, dropt from some aethereal mouth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haply it is angels' duty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During slumber, shade by shade:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fine down this childish beauty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the thing it must be made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the world shall bring it praises, or the tomb shall see it fade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly, softly! make no noises!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he lieth dead and dumb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he hears the angels' voices
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding silence in the room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he muses deep the meaning of the Heaven-words as they come.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak not! he is consecrated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathe no breath across his eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted up and separated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hand of God he lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sweetness beyond touching held in cloistral sanctities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could ye bless him father mother ?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bless the dimple in his cheek?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare ye look at one another,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the benediction speak?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would ye not break out in weeping, and confess yourselves too weak?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is harmless ye are sinful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye are troubled he, at ease:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his slumber, virtue winful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floweth outward with increase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare not bless him! but be blessed by his peace and go in peace.

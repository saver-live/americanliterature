<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, by the verdure on thy thousand hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beloved England, doth the earth appear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite good enough for men to overbear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of God in, with rebellious wills!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot say the morning-sun fulfils
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingloriously its course, nor that the clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong stars without significance insphere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our habitation: we, meantime, our ills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heap up against this good and lift a cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this work-day world, this ill-spread feast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if ourselves were better certainly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than what we come to. Maker and High Priest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask thee not my joys to multiply, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to make me worthier of the least.
</pre>

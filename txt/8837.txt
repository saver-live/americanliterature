<p><b>I</b><br> BECAUSE the currents of our love are poured<br> Through the slow welter of the primal flood<br> From some blind source of monster-haunted mud,<br> And flung together by random forces stored<br> Ere the vast void with rushing worlds was scored--<br> Because we know ourselves but the dim scud<br> Tossed from their heedless keels, the sea-blown bud<br> That wastes and scatters ere the wave has roared--<br> <br> Because we have this knowledge in our veins,<br> Shall we deny the journey's gathered lore--<br> The great refusals and the long disdains,<br> The stubborn questing for a phantom shore,<br> The sleepless hopes and memorable pains,<br> And all mortality's immortal gains?<br> <br> <b>II</b><br> Because our kiss is as the moon to draw<br> The mounting waters of that red-lit sea<br> That circles brain with sense, and bids us be<br> The playthings of an elemental law,<br> Shall we forego the deeper touch of awe<br> On love's extremest pinnacle, where we,<br> Winging the vistas of infinity,<br> Gigantic on the mist our shadows saw?<br> <br> Shall kinship with the dim first-moving clod<br> Not draw the folded pinion from the soul,<br> And shall we not, by spirals vision-trod,<br> Reach upward to some still-retreating goal,<br> As earth, escaping from the night's control,<br> Drinks at the founts of morning like a god?<br> <br> <b>III</b><br> All, all is sweet in that commingled draught<br> Mysterious, that life pours for lovers' thirst,<br> And I would meet your passion as the first<br> Wild woodland woman met her captor's craft,<br> Or as the Greek whose fearless beauty laughed<br> And doffed her raiment by the Attic flood;<br> But in the streams of my belated blood<br> Flow all the warring potions love has quaffed.<br> <br> How can I be to you the nymph who danced<br> Smooth by Ilissus as the plane-tree's bole,<br> Or how the Nereid whose drenched lashes glanced<br> Like sea-flowers through the summer sea's long roll--<br> I that have also been the nun entranced<br> Who night-long held her Bridegroom in her soul?<br> <br> <b>IV</b><br> "Sad Immortality is dead," you say,<br> "And all her grey brood banished from the soul;<br> Life, like the earth, is now a rounded whole,<br> The orb of man's dominion. Live to-day."<br> And every sense in me leapt to obey,<br> Seeing the routed phantoms backward roll;<br> But from their waning throng a whisper stole,<br> And touched the morning splendour with decay.<br> <br> "Sad Immortality is dead; and we<br> The funeral train that bear her to her grave.<br> Yet hath she left a two-faced progeny<br> In hearts of men, and some will always see<br> The skull beneath the wreath, yet always crave<br> In every kiss the folded kiss to be."<br> <br> <b>V</b><br> Yet for one rounded moment I will be<br> No more to you than what my lips may give,<br> And in the circle of your kisses live<br> As in some island of a storm-blown sea,<br> Where the cold surges of infinity<br> Upon the outward reefs unheeded grieve,<br> And the loud murmur of our blood shall weave<br> Primeval silences round you and me.<br> <br> If in that moment we are all we are<br> We live enough. Let this for all requite.<br> Do I not know, some winged things from far<br> Are borne along illimitable night<br> To dance their lives out in a single flight<br> Between the moonrise and the setting star?<br> <br> <b>VI</b><br> The Moment came, with sacramental cup<br> Lifted--and all the vault of life grew bright<br> With tides of incommensurable light--<br> But tremblingly I turned and covered up<br> My face before the wonder. Down the slope<br> I heard her feet in irretrievable flight,<br> And when I looked again, my stricken sight<br> Saw night and rain in a dead world agrope.<br> <br> Now walks her ghost beside me, whispering<br> With lips derisive: "Thou that wouldst forego--<br> What god assured thee that the cup I bring<br> Globes not in every drop the cosmic show,<br> All that the insatiate heart of man can wring<br> From life's long vintage?--Now thou shalt not know."<br> <br> <b>VII</b><br> Shall I not know? I, that could always catch<br> The sunrise in one beam along the wall,<br> The nests of June in April's mating call,<br> And ruinous autumn in the wind's first snatch<br> At summer's green impenetrable thatch--<br> That always knew far off the secret fall<br> Of a god's feet across the city's brawl,<br> The touch of silent fingers on my latch?<br> <br> Not thou, vain Moment! Something more than thou<br> Shall write the score of what mine eyes have wept,<br> The touch of kisses that have missed my brow,<br> The murmur of wings that brushed me while I slept,<br> And some mute angel in the breast even now<br> Measures my loss by all that I have kept.<br> <br> <b>VIII</b><br> Strive we no more. Some hearts are like the bright<br> Tree-chequered spaces, flecked with sun and shade,<br> Where gathered in old days the youth and maid<br> To woo, and weave their dances: with the night<br> They cease their flutings, and the next day's light<br> Finds the smooth green unconscious of their tread,<br> And ready its velvet pliancies to spread<br> Under fresh feet, till these in turn take flight.<br> <br> But other hearts a long long road doth span,<br> From some far region of old works and wars,<br> And the weary armies of the thoughts of man<br> Have trampled it, and furrowed it with scars,<br> And sometimes, husht, a sacred caravan<br> Moves over it alone, beneath the stars.</p>

Care is all stuff:—
      Puff! Puff!
To puff is enough:—
      Puff! Puff
More musky than snuff,
And warm is a puff:—
      Puff! Puff
Here we sit mid our puffs,
Like old lords in their ruffs,
Snug as bears in their muffs:—
      Puff! Puff
Then puff, puff, puff,
For care is all stuff,
Puffed off in a puff—
      Puff! Puff!

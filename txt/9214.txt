<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being out of heart with government
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a broken root to fling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the proud, wayward squirrel went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking delight that he could spring;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, with that low whinnying sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is like laughter, sprang again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so to the other tree at a bound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the tame will, nor timid brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threw him up to laugh on the bough;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No government appointed him.

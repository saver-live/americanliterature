<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wind came up out of the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "O mists, make room for me."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hailed the ships, and cried, "Sail on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye mariners, the night is gone."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurried landward far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying, "Awake! it is the day."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It said unto the forest, "Shout!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang all your leafy banners out!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It touched the wood-bird's folded wing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "O bird, awake and sing."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er the farms, "O chanticleer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your clarion blow; the day is near."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It whispered to the fields of corn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bow down, and hail the coming morn."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shouted through the belfry-tower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awake, O bell! proclaim the hour."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It crossed the churchyard with a sigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "Not yet! in quiet lie."

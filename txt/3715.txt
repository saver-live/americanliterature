<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first my way to fair I took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few pence in purse had I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long I used to stand and look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At things I could not buy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now times are altered:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To buy a thing, I can;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pence are here and heres the fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wheres the lost young man?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - To think that two and two are four
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And neither five nor three
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of man has long been sore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long tis like to be.

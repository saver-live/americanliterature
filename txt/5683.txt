               Heaven bless you, my friend -
                 You, the man who won't sweat;
               Here's a quarter to spend.

               If you did but mend,
                 My job you would get; -
               Heaven bless you, my friend. -

               On you I depend
                 For my work, don't forget; -
               Here's a quarter to spend.

               My hand I extend,
                 For I love you, you bet: -
               Here's a quarter to spend.

               Ah! you comprehend
                 That I owe a debt;
               Heaven bless you, my friend,
               Here's a quarter to spend.

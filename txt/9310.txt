<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it were anything but merely voice!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The No King cried who after that was King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he had not heard of anything
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That balanced with a word is more than noise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Old Romance being kind, let him prevail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere or somehow that I have forgot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though hed but cannon, Whereas we that had thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been defeated by that pledge you gave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In momentary anger long ago;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I that have not your faith, how shall I know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in the blinding light beyond the grave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well find so good a thing as that we have lost?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hourly kindness, the days common speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The habitual content of each with each
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When neither soul nor body has been crossed.

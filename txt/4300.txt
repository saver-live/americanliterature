<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou whose face hath felt the Winter's wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose eye has seen the snow-clouds hung in mist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the black elm tops 'mong the freezing stars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thee the spring will be a harvest-time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou, whose only book has been the light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of supreme darkness which thou feddest on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night after night when Phoebus was away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thee the Spring shall be a triple morn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O fret not after knowledge, I have none,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet my song comes native with the warmth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O fret not after knowledge, I have none,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the Evening listens. He who saddens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At thought of idleness cannot be idle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he's awake who thinks himself asleep.
</pre>

<pre>I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends of faces unknown and a land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unvisited over the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who tell me how lonely you stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a single gold curl in the hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held up to be looked at by me,

II.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you ask me to ponder and say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a father and mother can do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bright fellow-locks put away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of reach, beyond kiss, in the clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the violets press nearer than you.

III.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I speak like a poet, or run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into weak woman's tears for relief?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, children! I never lost one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet my arm 's round my own little son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love knows the secret of Grief.

IV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I feel what it must be and is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When God draws a new angel so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the house of a man up to His,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a murmur of music, you miss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a rapture of light, you forgo.

V.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How you think, staring on at the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the face of your angel flashed in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That its brightness, familiar before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burns off from you ever the more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the dark of your sorrow and sin.

VI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God lent him and takes him,' you sigh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, there let me break with your pain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's generous in giving, say I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thing which He gives, I deny
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That He ever can take back again.

VII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gives what He gives. I appeal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all who bear babes in the hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the veil of the body we feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rent round us, while torments reveal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motherhood's advent in power,

VIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the babe cries! has each of us known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By apocalypse (God being there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full in nature) the child is our own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life of life, love of love, moan of moan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all changes, all times, everywhere.

IX.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's ours and for ever. Believe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O father! O mother, look back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the first love's assurance. To give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Means with God not to tempt or deceive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cup thrust in Benjamin's sack.

X.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gives what He gives. Be content!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He resumes nothing given, be sure!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God lend? Where the usurers lent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In His temple, indignant He went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scourged away all those impure.

XI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lends not; but gives to the end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As He loves to the end. If it seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That He draws back a gift, comprehend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis to add to it rather, amend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finish it up to your dream,

XII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or keep, as a mother will toys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too costly, though given by herself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the room shall be stiller from noise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the children more fit for such joys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept over their heads on the shelf.

XIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So look up, friends! you, who indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have possessed in your house a sweet piece
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Heaven which men strive for, must need
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be more earnest than others are,Â—speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they loiter, persist where they cease.

XIV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know how one angel smiles there.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then weep not. 'Tis easy for you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be drawn by a single gold hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that curl, from earth's storm and despair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the safe place above us. Adieu.

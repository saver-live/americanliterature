<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loitering with a vacant eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the Grecian gallery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brooding on my heavy ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met a statue standing still.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still in marble stone stood he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stedfastly he looked at me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well met," I thought the look would say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We both were fashioned far away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We neither knew, when we were young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Londoners we live among."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still he stood and eyed me hard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An earnest and a grave regard:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, lad, drooping with your lot?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too would be where I am not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too survey that endless line
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of men whose thoughts are not as mine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years, ere you stood up from rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my neck the collar prest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years, when you lay down your ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall stand and bear it still.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courage, lad, 'tis not for long:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand, quit you like stone, be strong."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I thought his look would say;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And light on me my trouble lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I slept out in flesh and bone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manful like the man of stone.

<p>I don't know if you're alive or dead -<br> Can you be found on earth so?<br> Or only in twilit thoughts instead,<br> Be mourned, in that peaceful glow?<br> <br> All for you: the prayer by day,<br> The hot sleeplessness at night,<br> The white flock of poetry,<br> And the blue fire of my eyes.<br> <br> No one was cherished more,<br> Or made me suffer: no, not<br> He who betrayed me to torment,<br> Nor he who caressed and forgot.<br></p>

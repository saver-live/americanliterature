Its forty in the shade to-day, the spouting eaves declare;
The boulders nose above the drift, the southern slopes are bare;
Hub-deep in slush Apollos car swings north along the Zod,
iac. Good luck, the Spring is back, and Pan is on the road!

His house is Gee &amp; Tellus Sons,, so goes his jest with men,
He sold us Zeus knows what last year; hell take us in again.
Disguised behind the livery-team, fur-coated, rubber-shod,
Yet Apis from the bull-pen lows, he knows his brother God!

Now down the lines of tasseled pines the yearning whispers wake,
Pithys of old thy love behold! Come in for Hermess sake!
How long since that so-Boston boot with reeling Maenads ran!
Numen adest! Let be the rest. Pipe and we pay, O Pan.

(What though his phlox and hollyhocks ere half a month demised?
What though his ampelopsis clambered not as advertised?
Though every seed was guaranteed and every standard true,
Forget, forgive they did not live! Believe, and buy anew!)

Now oer a careless knee he flings the painted page abroad,
Such bloom hath never eye beheld this side of Eden Sword;
Such fruit Pomona marks her own, yea, Liber oversees,
That we may reach (one dollar each) the Lost Hesperides!

Serene, assenting, unabashed, he writes our orders down:,
Blue Asphodel on all our paths, a few true bays for crown,
Uncankered bud, immoral flower, and leaves that never fall,
Apples of Gold, of Youth, of Health, and, thank you, Pan, thats all.

Hes off along the drifted pent to catch the Windsor train,
And swindle every citizen from Keene to Lake Champlain.
But where his goats-hoof cut the crust, beloved, look below,
Hes left us (Ill forgive him all) the may-flower neath her snow!

<p>We wove a web in childhood,<br> A web of sunny air;<br> We dug a spring in infancy<br> Of water pure and fair;<br> <br> We sowed in youth a mustard seed,<br> We cut an almond rod;<br> We are now grown up to riper age-<br> Are they withered in the sod?<br> <br> Are they blighted, failed and faded,<br> Are they mouldered back to clay?<br> For life is darkly shaded;<br> And its joys fleet fast away.<br> <br> Faded! the web is still of air,<br> But how its folds are spread,<br> And from its tints of crimson clear<br> How deep a glow is shed.<br> The light of an Italian sky.<br> Where clouds of sunset lingering lie<br> Is not more ruby-red.<br> <br> But the spring was under a mossy stone,<br> Its jet may gush no more.<br> Hark! sceptic bid thy doubts be gone,<br> Is that a feeble roar<br> Rushing around thee? Lo! the tide<br> Of waves where armed fleets may ride<br> Sinking and swelling, frowns and smiles<br> An ocean with a thousand isles<br> And scare a glimpse of shore.<br> <br> The mustard-seed in distant land<br> Bends down a mighty tree,<br> The dry unbudding almond-wand<br> Has touched eternity.<br> There came a second miracle<br> Such as on Aaron's sceptre fell,<br> And sapless grew like life from heath,<br> Bud, bloom and fruit in mingling wreath<br> All twined the shrivelled off-shoot round<br> As flowers lie on the lone grave-mound.<br> <br> Dream that stole o'er us in the time<br> When life was in its vernal clime,<br> Dream that still faster o'er us steals<br> As the wild star of spring declining<br> The advent of that day reveals,<br> That glows in Sirius fiery shining:<br> Oh! as thou swellest, and as the scenes<br> Cover this cold world's darkest features,<br> Stronger each change my spirit weans<br> To bow before thy god-like creatures.<br> <br> When I sat 'neath a strange roof-tree<br> With nought I knew or loved round me<br> Oh how my heart shrank back to thee,<br> Then I felt how fast thy ties had bound me.</p>

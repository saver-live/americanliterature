<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever, since my childish looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could rest on Nature's pictured books;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever, since my childish tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could name the themes our bards have sung;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long, the sweetness of their singing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath been to me a rapture bringing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet ask me not the reason why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have delight in minstrelsy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that much whereof I sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is shapen but for vanishing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that summer's flower and leaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shine and shade are very brief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the heart they brighten, may,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before them all, be sheathed in clay!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the reason why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have delight in minstrelsy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few there are, whose smile and praise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My minstrel hope, would kindly raise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of those few, Death may impress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lips of some with silentness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some may friendship's faith resign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heed no more a song of mine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask not, ask not the reason why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have delight in minstrelsy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetest song that minstrels sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will charm not Joy to tarrying;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greenest bay that earth can grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will shelter not in burning woe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand voices will not cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one is mute that aye is dear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there, alas! no reason why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have delight in minstrelsy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know! The turf is green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the rain's fast-dropping sheen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet asks not why that deeper hue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth all its tender leaves renew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, like-minded, am content,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While music to my soul is sent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To question not the reason why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have delight in minstrelsy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years pass, my life with them shall pass:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon, the cricket in the grass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And summer bird, shall louder sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than she who owns a minstrel's string.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh then may some, the dear and few,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall her love, whose truth they knew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all forget to question why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had delight in minstrelsy!

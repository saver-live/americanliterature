<p>The spring wind comes from the east and quickly passes,<br> Leaving faint ripples in the wine of the golden bowl.<br> The flowers fall, flake after flake, myriads together.<br> <br> You, pretty girl, wine-flushed,<br> Your rosy face is rosier still.<br> How long may the peach and plum trees flower<br> By the green-painted house?<br> The fleeting light deceives man,<br> Brings soon the stumbling age.<br> <br> Rise and dance<br> In the westering sun<br> While the urge of youthful years is yet unsubdued!<br> What avails to lament after one's hair has turned white<br> like silken threads? <br></p>

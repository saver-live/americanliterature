<p>When I was a boy I called the moon a<br> white plate of jade, sometimes it looked<br> like a great mirror hanging in the sky,<br> first came the two legs of the fairy<br> and the cassia tree, but for whom the rabbit<br> kept on pounding medical herbs, I<br> just could not guess. Now the moon is being<br> swallowed by the toad and the light<br> flickers out leaving darkness all around;<br> I hear that when nine of the burning suns out<br> of the ten were ordered to be shot down by<br> the Emperor Yao, all has since been quiet<br> and peaceful both for heaven and man,<br> but this eating up of the moon is for me<br> a truly ugly scene filling me with forebodings<br> wondering what will come out of it. <br></p>

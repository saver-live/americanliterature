<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its loveliness increases; it will never
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the green world they live in; and clear rills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That for themselves a cooling covert make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have imagined for the mighty dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An endless fountain of immortal drink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor do we merely feel these essences
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one short hour; no, even as the trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That whisper round a temple become soon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passion poesy, glories infinite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunt us till they become a cheering light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They alway must be with us, or we die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will trace the story of Endymion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very music of the name has gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into my being, and each pleasant scene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is growing fresh before me as the green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our own vallies: so I will begin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while I cannot hear the city's din;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while the early budders are just new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And run in mazes of the youngest hue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About old forests; while the willow trails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little boat, for many quiet hours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many and many a verse I hope to write,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must be near the middle of my story.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See it half finished: but let Autumn bold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With universal tinge of sober gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be all about me when I make an end.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now at once, adventuresome, I send
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My herald thought into a wilderness:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My uncertain path with green, that I may speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So plenteously all weed-hidden roots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never again saw he the happy pens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whither his brethren, bleating with content,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the hills at every nightfall went.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the white flock, but pass'd unworried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By angry wolf, or pard with prying head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it came to some unfooted plains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a wide lawn, whence one could only see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stems thronging all around between the swell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of turf and slanting branches: who could tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freshness of the space of heaven above,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would often beat its wings, and often too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little cloud would move across the blue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full in the middle of this pleasantness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood a marble altar, with a tress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowers budded newly; and the dew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had taken fairy phantasies to strew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the dawned light in pomp receive.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of brightness so unsullied, that therein
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A melancholy spirit well might win
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oblivion, and melt out his essence fine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the winds: rain-scented eglantine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lark was lost in him; cold springs had run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man's voice was on the mountains; and the mass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel this sun-rise and its glories old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while the silent workings of the dawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were busiest, into that self-same lawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A troop of little children garlanded;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gathering round the altar, seemed to pry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnestly round as wishing to espy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some folk of holiday: nor had they waited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many moments, ere their ears were sated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a faint breath of music, which ev'n then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill'd out its voice, and died away again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a little space again it gave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through copse-clad vallies, ere their death, oer-taking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, as deep into the wood as we
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair faces and a rush of garments white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plainer and plainer shewing, till at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the widest alley they all past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making directly for the woodland altar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In telling of this goodly company,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their old piety, and of their glee:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let a portion of ethereal dew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall on my head, and presently unmew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading the way, young damsels danced along,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing the burden of a shepherd song;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each having a white wicker over brimm'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As may be read of in Arcadian books;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the great deity, for earth too ripe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let his divinity o'er-flowing die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In music, through the vales of Thessaly:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now coming from beneath the forest trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A venerable priest full soberly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begirt with ministring looks: alway his eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after him his sacred vestments swept.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his left he held a basket full
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of winter hoar. Then came another crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their share of the ditty. After them appear'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up-followed by a multitude that rear'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easily rolling so as scarce to mar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stood therein did seem of great renown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, for those simple times, his garments were
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hung a silver bugle, and between
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To common lookers on, like one who dream'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of idleness in groves Elysian:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there were some who feelingly could scan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lurking trouble in his nether lip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see that oftentimes the reins would slip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of logs piled solemnly. Ah, well-a-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should our young Endymion pine away!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sudden veneration: women meek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion too, without a forest peer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among his brothers of the mountain chase.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In midst of all, the venerable priest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, after lifting up his aged hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus spake he: "Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether descended from beneath the rocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That overtop your mountains; whether come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From vallies where the pipe is never dumb;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nibble their fill at ocean's very marge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all ye gentle girls who foster up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Udderless lambs, and in a little cup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will put choice honey for a favoured youth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, every one attend! for in good truth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great bounty from Endymion our lord.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His early song against yon breezy sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That spreads so clear o'er our solemnity."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while the earth was drinking it, and while
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gummy frankincense was sparkling bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From jagged trunks, and overshadoweth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lov'st to see the hamadryads dress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreary melody of bedded reeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In desolate places, where dank moisture breeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethinking thee, how melancholy loth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast to lose fair Syrinx do thou now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By thy love's milky brow!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all the trembling mazes that she ran,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear us, great Pan!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time thou wanderest at eventide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sunny meadows, that outskirt the side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their golden honeycombs; our village leas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fairest-blossom'd beans and poppied corn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chuckling linnet its five young unborn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sing for thee; low creeping strawberries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their summer coolness; pent up butterflies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its completions be quickly near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By every wind that nods the mountain pine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O forester divine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For willing service; whether to surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or upward ragged precipices flit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by mysterious enticement draw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bewildered shepherds to their path again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to tread breathless round the frothy main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gather up all fancifullest shells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while they pelt each other on the crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all the echoes that about thee ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear us, O satyr king!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ever and anon to his shorn peers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When snouted wild-boars routing tender corn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep off mildews, and all weather harms:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange ministrant of undescribed sounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That come a swooning over hollow grounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wither drearily on barren moors:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dread opener of the mysterious doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading to universal knowledge see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great son of Dryope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many that are come to pay their vows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With leaves about their brows!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be still the unimaginable lodge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For solitary thinkings; such as dodge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conception to the very bourne of heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That spreading in this dull and clodded earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives it a touch ethereal a new birth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be still a symbol of immensity;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A firmament reflected in a sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An element filling the space between;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unknown but no more: we humbly screen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And giving out a shout most heaven rending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conjure thee to receive our humble Paean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon thy Mount Lycean!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even while they brought the burden to a close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shout from the whole multitude arose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lingered in the air like dying rolls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dolphins bob their noses through the brine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young companies nimbly began dancing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the swift treble pipe, and humming string.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, those fair living forms swam heavenly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tunes forgotten out of memory:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair creatures! whose young children's children bred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thermopylæ its heroes not yet dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in old marbles ever beautiful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High genitors, unconscious did they cull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time's sweet first-fruits they danc'd to weariness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then in quiet circles did they press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hillock turf, and caught the latter end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some strange history, potent to send
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young mind from its bodily tenement.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On either side; pitying the sad death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Zephyr slew him, Zephyr penitent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archers too, upon a wider plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very, very deadliness did nip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplifting his strong bow into the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many might after brighter visions stare:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Argonauts, in blind amaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tossing about on Neptune's restless ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until, from the horizon's vaulted side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shot a golden splendour far and wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spangling those million poutings of the brine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the exaltation of Apollo's bow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might turn their steps towards the sober ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where sat Endymion and the aged priest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silvery setting of their mortal star.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There they discours'd upon the fragile bar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That keeps us from our homes ethereal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what our duties there: to nightly call
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summon all the downiest clouds together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sun's purple couch; to emulate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ministring the potent rule of fate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A world of other unguess'd offices.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon they wander'd, by divine converse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one his own anticipated bliss.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One felt heart-certain that he could not miss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lips with music for the welcoming.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another wish'd, mid that eternal spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, ever after, through those regions be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His messenger, his little Mercury.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some were athirst in soul to see again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times long past; to sit with them, and talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the chances in their earthly walk;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of happiness, to when upon the moors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benighted, close they huddled from the cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fond imaginations, saving him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion: yet hourly had he striven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hide the cankering venom, that had riven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fainting recollections. Now indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden silence, or the whispers low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one who on the earth had never stept.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frozen in that old tale Arabian.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who whispers him so pantingly and close?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peona, his sweet sister: of all those,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A yielding up, a cradling on her care.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a path between two little streams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until they came to where these streamlets fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little shallop, floating there hard by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dipt again, with the young couple's weight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peona guiding, through the water straight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards a bowery island opposite;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which gaining presently, she steered light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nested was an arbour, overwove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By many a summer's silent fingering;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whose cool bosom she was used to bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her playmates, with their needle broidery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And minstrel memories of times gone by.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she was gently glad to see him laid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under her favourite bower's quiet shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peona's busy hand against his lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A patient watch over the stream that creeps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windingly by it, so the quiet maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of silvery enchantment! who, upfurl'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But renovates and lives? Thus, in the bower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion was calm'd to life again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "I feel this thine endearing love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All through my bosom: thou art as a dove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About me; and the pearliest dew not brings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such morning incense from the fields of May,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From those kind eyes, the very home and haunt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sisterly affection. Can I want
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, any longer, I will pass my days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the breathed boar: again I'll poll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I'll linger in a sloping mead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul to keep in its resolved course."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereat Peona, in their silver source,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took a lute, from which there pulsing came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lively prelude, fashioning the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More subtle cadenced, more forest wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing since has floated in the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quick invisible strings, even though she saw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion's spirit melt away and thaw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the deep intoxication.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her self-possession swung the lute aside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And earnestly said: "Brother, 'tis vain to hide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou dost know of things mysterious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immortal, starry; such alone could thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Paphian dove upon a message sent?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her naked limbs among the alders green;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something more high perplexing in thy face!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "Art thou so pale, who wast so bland
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And merry in our meadows? How is this?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That toiling years would put within my grasp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man e'er panted for a mortal love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all have set my heavier grief above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things which happen. Rightly have they done:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, who still saw the horizontal sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My spear aloft, as signal for the chace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, who, for very sport of heart, would race
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my own steed from Araby; pluck down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vulture from his towery perching; frown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lion into growling, loth retire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This river does not see the naked sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it begins to progress silverly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the western border of the wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems at the distance like a crescent moon:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in that nook, the very pride of June,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I been used to pass my weary eves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rather for the sun unwilling leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So dear a picture of his sovereign power,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I could witness his most kingly hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he doth lighten up the golden reins,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And paces leisurely down amber plains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His snorting four. Now when his chariot last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which I wondered greatly, knowing well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, sitting down close by, began to muse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until my head was dizzy and distraught.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shaping visions all about my sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchantment that afterwards befel?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never tongue, although it overteem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could figure out and to conception bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the zenith, where the milky way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And travelling my eye, until the doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I became loth and fearful to alight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From such high soaring by a downward glance:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading imaginary pinions wide.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, presently, the stars began to glide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faint away, before my eager view:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passionately bright, my dazzled soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commingling with her argent spheres did roll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through clear and cloudy, even when she went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last into a dark and vapoury tent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of planets all were in the blue again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a bright something, sailing down apace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making me quickly veil my eyes and face:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I look'd, and, O ye deities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from Olympus watch our destinies!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence that completed form of all completeness?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such follying before thee yet she had,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were simply gordian'd up and braided,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The which were blended in, I know not how,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a paradise of lips and eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plays about its fancy, till the stings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human neighbourhood envenom all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto what awful power shall I call?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what high fane? Ah! see her hovering feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handfuls of daisies." "Endymion, how strange!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream within dream!" "She took an airy range,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, towards me, like a very maid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet held my recollection, even as one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dives three fathoms where the waters run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt upmounted in that region
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where falling stars dart their artillery forth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eagles struggle with the buffeting north
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That balances the heavy meteor-stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To faint once more by looking on my bliss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was distracted; madly did I kiss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooing arms which held me, and did give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take in draughts of life from the gold fount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moments, by some greedy help that seem'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second self, that each might be redeem'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plunder'd of its load of blessedness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her very cheek against my crowned lip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, at that moment, felt my body dip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a warmer air: a moment more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scent of violets, and blossoming limes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made delicate from all white-flower bells;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once, above the edges of our nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arch face peep'd, an Oread as I guess'd.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In midst of all this heaven? Why not see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stare them from me? But no, like a spark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That needs must die, although its little beam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell into nothing into stupid sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it was, until a gentle creep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A careful moving caught my waking ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My clenched hands; for lo! the poppies hung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy ditty, and the sullen day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had chidden herald Hesperus away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With leaden looks: the solitary breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wayward melancholy; and r thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away I wander'd all the pleasant hues
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In little journeys, I beheld in it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disguis'd demon, missioned to knit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul with under darkness; to entice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My stumblings down some monstrous precipice:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I eager followed, and did curse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things, with all their comfortings, are given
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of weary life."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ended he, and both
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat silent: for the maid was very loth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer; feeling well that breathed words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put on such a look as would say, Shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could as soon have crush'd away the life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said with trembling chance: "Is this the cause?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That one who through this middle earth should pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name upon the harp-string, should achieve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No higher bard than simple maidenhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing alone, and fearfully, how the blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew not where; and how he would say, nay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could it be but love? How a ring-dove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the ballad of his sad life closes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sighs, and an alas! Endymion!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be rather in the trumpet's mouth, anon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the winds at large that all may hearken!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, before the crystal heavens darken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watch and dote upon the silver lakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With horses prancing o'er them, palaces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And towers of amethyst, would I so tease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pleasant days, because I could not mount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into those regions? The Morphean fount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that fine element that visions, dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into its airy channels with so subtle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circled a million times within the space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tinting of its quality: how light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the mere nothing that engenders them!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then wherefore sully the entrusted gem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nothing but a dream?" Hereat the youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Widened a little, as when Zephyr bids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little breeze to creep between the fans
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of careless butterflies: amid his pains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full palatable; and a colour grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peona! ever have I long'd to slake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ready minds to fellowship divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fellowship with essence; till we shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear religion of heaven! Fold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of music's kiss impregnates the free winds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a sympathetic touch unbinds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eolian magic from their lucid wombs:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old ditties sigh above their father's grave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round every spot where trod Apollo's foot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where long ago a giant battle was;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every place where infant Orpheus slept.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel we these things? that moment have we stept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a sort of oneness, and our state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is like a floating spirit's. But there are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richer entanglements, enthralments far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the chief intensity: the crown of these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is made of love and friendship, and sits high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the forehead of humanity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its more ponderous and bulky worth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is friendship, whence there ever issues forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steady splendour; but at the tip-top,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of light, and that is love: its influence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which we start and fret; till in the end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melting into its radiance, we blend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingle, and so become a part of it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor with aught else can our souls interknit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wingedly: when we combine therewith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we are nurtured like a pelican brood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, so delicious is the unsating food,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That men, who might have tower'd in the van
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the congregated world, to fan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And winnow from the coming step of time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All chaff of custom, wipe away all slime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left by men-slugs and human serpentry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been content to let occasion die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst they did sleep in love's elysium.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than speak against this ardent listlessness:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have ever thought that it might bless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world with benefits unknowingly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As does the nightingale, upperched high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just so may love, although 'tis understood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere commingling of passionate breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Produce more than our searching witnesseth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I know not: but who, of men, can tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If human souls did never kiss and greet?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, if this earthly love has power to make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's being mortal, immortal; to shake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambition from their memories, and brim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their measure of content; what merest whim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems all this poor endeavour after fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one, who keeps within his stedfast aim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A love immortal, an immortal too.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look not so wilder'd; for these things are true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never can be born of atomies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My restless spirit never could endure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To brood so long upon one luxury,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless it did, though fearfully, espy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hope beyond the shadow of a dream.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sayings will the less obscured seem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I have told thee how my waking sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has made me scruple whether that same night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the matron-temple of Latona,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which we should see but for these darkening boughs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past them, but he must brush on every side.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far as the slabbed margin of a well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose patient level peeps its crystal eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right upward, through the bushes, to the sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like vestal primroses, but dark velvet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edges them round, and they have golden pits:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all above was faint with mid-day heat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd bubble up the water through a reed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When love-lorn hours had left me less a child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat contemplating the figures wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy chance: so happy, I was fain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To follow it upon the open plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, therefore, was just going; when, behold!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonder, fair as any I have told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same bright face I tasted in my sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling in the clear well. My heart did leap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the cool depth. It moved as if to flee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started up, when lo! refreshfully,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came upon my face, in plenteous showers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathing my spirit in a new delight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone preserved me from the drear abyss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of death, for the fair form had gone again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of weary days, made deeper exquisite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sorrow came upon me, heavier still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when I wander'd from the poppy hill:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a whole age of lingering moments crept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away at once the deadly yellow spleen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more been tortured with renewed life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When last the wintry gusts gave over strife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pity of the shatter'd infant buds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chatted with thee, and many days exil'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All torment from my breast; 'twas even then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straying about, yet, coop'd up in the den
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of helpless discontent, hurling my lance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From place to place, and following at chance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of a brook, whose silver ramble
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracing along, it brought me to a cave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nether sides of mossy stones and rock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said I, low voic'd: "Ah whither! 'Tis the grot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth her resign; and where her tender hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And babbles thorough silence, till her wits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are gone in tender madness, and anon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sadness. O that she would take my vows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathe them sighingly among the boughs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weave them dyingly send honey-whispers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round every leaf, that all those gentle lispers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May sigh my love unto her pitying!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O charitable echo! hear, and sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ditty to her! tell her" so I stay'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood stupefied with my own empty folly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blushing for the freaks of melancholy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt tears were coming, when I heard my name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion! the cave is secreter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trembles through my labyrinthine hair."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that oppress'd I hurried in. Ah! where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are those swift moments? Whither are they fled?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow the way to death, but patiently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And come instead demurest meditation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To occupy me wholly, and to fashion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more will I count over, link by link,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My chain of grief: no longer strive to find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-forgetfulness in mountain wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a calm round of hours shall make my days.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a paly flame of hope that plays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here I bid it die. Have not I caught,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, a more healthy countenance?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this the sun is setting; we may chance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet some of our near-dwellers with my car."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through autumn mists, and took Peona's hand:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stept into the boat, and launch'd from land.

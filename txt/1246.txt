<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God, bless God, all ye who suffer not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More grief than ye can weep for. That is well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is light grieving! lighter, none befell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Adam forfeited the primal lot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears! what are tears? The babe weeps in its cot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother singing, at her marriage-bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride weeps, and before the oracle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of high-faned hills the poet has forgot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such moisture on his cheeks. Thank God for grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who weep only! If, as some have done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye grope tear-blinded in a desert place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch but tombs, look up I those tears will run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon in long rivers down the lifted face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the vision clear for stars and sun
</pre>

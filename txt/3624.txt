<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star-filled seas are smooth to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From France to England strown;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black towers above the Portland light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The felon-quarried stone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On yonder island, not to rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never to stir forth free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from his folk a dead lad lies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That once was friends with me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie you easy, dream you light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleep you fast for aye;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And luckier may you find the night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than ever you found the day.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poison of asps is under our lips?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you seek us, then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking our knotted fellowships
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your noisy-footed men?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and time over we let them go;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing and slipping aside;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until they followed and troubled usso
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We struck back, and they died.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poison of asps is under our lips?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you wrench them apart?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn how the venom makes and drips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And works its way to the heart?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unjust that when we have done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that a serpent should,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gather our poisons, one by one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thin them out to your good.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poison of asps is under our lips.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is your answer? No!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we hissed at Adams eclipse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the reason you hate us so.

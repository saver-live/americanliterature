<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come hither all sweet Maidens soberly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down looking aye, and with a chasten'd light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid in the fringes of your eyelids white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meekly let your fair hands joined be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if so gentle that ye could not see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untouch'd, a victim of your beauty bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking away to his young spirit's night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking bewilder'd 'mid the dreary sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis young Leander toiling to his death.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigh swooning he doth purse his weary lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Hero's cheek, and smiles against her smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O horrid dream! see how his body dips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead-heavy; arms and shoulders gleam awhile;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's gone; up bubbles all his amorous breath!
</pre>

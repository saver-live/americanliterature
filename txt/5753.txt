<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who presented to me on my Seventy-second Birth-day, February 27, 1879, this Chair, made from the Wood of the Village Blacksmith's Chestnut Tree.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I a king, that I should call my own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This splendid ebon throne?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by what reason, or what right divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I proclaim it mine?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, perhaps, by right divine of song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may to me belong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only because the spreading chestnut tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of old was sung by me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I remember it in all its prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When in the summer-time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The affluent foliage of its branches made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cavern of cool shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, by the blacksmith's forge, beside the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its blossoms white and sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enticed the bees, until it seemed alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And murmured like a hive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the winds of autumn, with a shout,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tossed its great arms about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shining chestnuts, bursting from the sheath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropped to the ground beneath.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now some fragments of its branches bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaped as a stately chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have by my hearthstone found a home at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whisper of the past.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Danish king could not in all his pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repel the ocean tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, seated in this chair, I can in rhyme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll back the tide of Time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see again, as one in vision sees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blossoms and the bees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the children's voices shout and call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the brown chestnuts fall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the smithy with its fires aglow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear the bellows blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shrill hammers on the anvil beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The iron white with heat!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, dear children, have ye made for me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This day a jubilee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to my more than three-score years and ten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brought back my youth again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart hath its own memory, like the mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in it are enshrined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precious keepsakes, into which is wrought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The giver's loving thought.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only your love and your remembrance could
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give life to this dead wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make these branches, leafless now so long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blossom again in song.

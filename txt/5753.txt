<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold, uninterrupted rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That washed each southern window-pane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a river of the road;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sea of mist that overflowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house, the barns, the gilded vane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drowned the upland and the plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through which the oak-trees, broad and high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like phantom ships went drifting by;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, hidden behind a watery screen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun unseen, or only seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a faint pallor in the sky;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus cold and colorless and gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morn of that autumnal day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if reluctant to begin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawned on the silent Sudbury Inn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the guests that in it lay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full late they slept.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge of Sir Chanticleer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who on the empty threshing-floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disdainful of the rain outside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was strutting with a martial stride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if upon his thigh he wore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous broadsword of the Squire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "Behold me, and admire!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Poet seemed to hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drowse or dream, more near and near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the border-land of sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blowing of a blithesome horn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That laughed the dismal day to scorn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A splash of hoofs and rush of wheels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sand and mire like stranding keels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the road with sudden sweep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mail drove up the little steep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stopped beside the tavern door;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment stopped, and then again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With crack of whip and bark of dog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged forward through the sea of fog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all was silent as before,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All silent save the dripping rain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then one by one the guests came down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And greeted with a smile the Squire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sat before the parlor fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the paper fresh from town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First the Sicilian, like a bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his form appeared, was heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling and singing down the stair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the Student, with a look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As placid as a meadow-brook;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian, still perplexed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thoughts of this world and the next;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet then, as one who seems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in visions and in dreams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Musician, like a fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperion from whose golden hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance of the morning streams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And last the aromatic Jew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Alicant, who, as he threw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door wide open, on the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed round about him a perfume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of damask roses in full bloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a garden of the room.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakfast ended, each pursued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promptings of his various mood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the fire in silence smoked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taciturn, impassive Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in a pleasant revery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, by his gravity provoked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His portrait the Sicilian drew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrote beneath it "Edrehi,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Red Horse in Sudbury."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By far the busiest of them all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian in the hall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was feeding robins in a cage,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two corpulent and lazy birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vagrants and pilferers at best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one might trust the hostler's words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief instrument of their arrest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two poets of the Golden Age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heirs of a boundless heritage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fields and orchards, east and west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sunshine of long summer days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though outlawed now and dispossessed!--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the Theologian's phrase.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Student held discourse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Musician, on the source
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the legendary lore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the nations, scattered wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like silt and seaweed by the force
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fluctuation of the tide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tale repeated o'er and o'er,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With change of place and change of name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disguised, transformed, and yet the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've heard a hundred times before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet at the window mused,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw, as in a dream confused,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countenance of the Sun, discrowned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And haggard with a pale despair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the cloud-rack trail and drift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it, and the trees uplift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their leafless branches, and the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with the arrows of the rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard amid the mist below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like voices of distress and pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That haunt the thoughts of men insane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fateful cawings of the crow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then down the road, with mud besprent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drenched with rain from head to hoof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain-drops dripping from his mane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tail as from a pent-house roof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jaded horse, his head down bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed slowly, limping as he went.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Sicilian--who had grown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impatient longer to abide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prisoner, greatly mortified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see completely overthrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plans for angling in the brook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, leaning o'er the bridge of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch the speckled trout glide by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And float through the inverted sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still round and round the baited hook--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now paced the room with rapid stride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, pausing at the Poet's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked forth, and saw the wretched steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "Alas for human greed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with cold hand and stony eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus turns an old friend out to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or beg his food from gate to gate!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings a tale into my mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, if you are not disinclined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To listen, I will now relate."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All gave assent; all wished to hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not without many a jest and jeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of a spavined steed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the Student with the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put in his pleasant little jest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Malherbe, that Pegasus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but a horse that with all speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bears poets to the hospital;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Sicilian, self-possessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment's interval
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Began his simple story thus.

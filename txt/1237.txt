<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'O dreary life,' we cry, 'O dreary life!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still the generations of the birds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing through our sighing, and the flocks and herds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serenely live while we are keeping strife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Heaven's true purpose in us, as a knife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against which we may struggle! Ocean girds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unslackened the dry land, savannah-swards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unweary sweep, hills watch unworn, and rife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meek leaves drop yearly from the forest-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show, above, the unwasted stars that pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their old glory: O thou God of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant me some smaller grace than comes to these!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so much patience as a blade of grass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows by, contented through the heat and cold.

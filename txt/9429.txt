<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man that I praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cries out the empty well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives all his days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a hand on the bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can call the milch-cows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the comfortable door of his house.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who but an idiot would praise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry stones in a well?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Man that I praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cries out the leafless tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has married and stays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an old hearth, and he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On naught has set store
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But children and dogs on the floor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who but an idiot would praise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A withered tree?

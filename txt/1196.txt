&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prologue</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard an angel speak last night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said "Write!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write a Nation's curse for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And send it over the Western Sea."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I faltered, taking up the word:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so, my lord!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If curses must be, choose another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To send thy curse against my brother.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For I am bound by gratitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By love and blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To brothers of mine across the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stretch out kindly hands to me."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore," the voice said, "shalt thou write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My curse to-night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the summits of love a curse is driven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lightning is from the tops of heaven."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so," I answered. "Evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is sore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my own land's sins: for little feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of children bleeding along the street:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For parked-up honors that gainsay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right of way:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For almsgiving through a door that is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not open enough for two friends to kiss:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For love of freedom which abates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the Straits:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For patriot virtue starved to vice on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-praise, self-interest, and suspicion:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For an oligarchic parliament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bribes well-meant.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What curse to another land assign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When heavy-souled for the sins of mine?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore," the voice said, "shalt thou write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My curse to-night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because thou hast strength to see and hate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A foul thing done within thy gate."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so," I answered once again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To curse, choose men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I, a woman, have only known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the heart melts and the tears run down."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore," the voice said, "shalt thou write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My curse to-night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some women weep and curse, I say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And no one marvels), night and day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And thou shalt take their part to-night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep and write.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A curse from the depths of womanhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is very salt, and bitter, and good."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thus I wrote, and mourned indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What all may read.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, as was enjoined on me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I send it over the Western Sea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Curse</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because ye have broken your own chain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of brave men climbing a Nation's height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet thence bear down with brand and thong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On souls of others, for this wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because yourselves are standing straight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Freedom's foremost acolyte,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet keep calm footing all the time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On writhing bond-slaves, for this crime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because ye prosper in God's name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a claim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To honor in the old world's sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet do the fiend's work perfectly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In strangling martyrs, for this lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall watch while kings conspire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the people's smouldering fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, warm for your part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall never dare O shame!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To utter the thought into flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which burns at your heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall watch while nations strive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bloodhounds, die or survive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drop faint from their jaws,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or throttle them backward to death;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only under your breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall favor the cause.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall watch while strong men draw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nets of feudal law
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strangle the weak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, counting the sin for a sin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your soul shall be sadder within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the word ye shall speak.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When good men are praying erect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Christ may avenge His elect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deliver the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayer in your ears, said low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall sound like the tramp of a foe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's driving you forth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wise men give you their praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shall praise in the heat of the phrase,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if carried too far.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ye boast your own charters kept true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall blush; for the thing which ye do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derides what ye are.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fools cast taunts at your gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your scorn ye shall somewhat abate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ye look o'er the wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your conscience, tradition, and name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explode with a deadlier blame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the worst of them all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, wherever ill deeds shall be done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, plant your flag in the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the ill-doers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And recoil from clenching the curse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of God's witnessing Universe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a curse of yours.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the curse. Write.

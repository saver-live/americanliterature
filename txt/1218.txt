<pre>I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face, which, duly as the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose up for me with life begun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mark all bright hours of the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hourly love, is dimmed away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet my days go on, go on.

II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tongue which, like a stream, could run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth music from the roughest stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every morning with 'Good day'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make each day good, is hushed away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet my days go on, go on.

III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart which, like a staff, was one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mine to lean and rest upon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest on the longest day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With steadfast love, is caught away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet my days go on, go on.

IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cold before my summer's done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deaf in Nature's general tune,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fallen too low for special fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, with hope no longer here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the tears drop, my days go on.

V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world goes whispering to its own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anguish pierces to the bone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tender friends go sighing round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What love can ever cure this wound?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My days go on, my days go on.

VI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past rolls forward on the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes all night. O dreams begun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be ended! Ended bliss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life that will not end in this!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My days go on, my days go on.

VII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breath freezes on my lips to moan:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one alone, once not alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit and knock at Nature's door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart-bare, heart-hungry, very poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose desolated days go on.

VIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knock and cry, Undone, undone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there no help, no comfort,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No gleaning in the wide wheat plains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where others drive their loaded wains?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My vacant days go on, go on.

IX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Nature, though the snows be down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinks kindly of the bird of June:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little red hip on the tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is ripe for such. What is for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose days so winterly go on?

X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bird am I, to sing in June,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dare not ask an equal boon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good nests and berries red are Nature's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give away to better creatures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet my days go on, go on.

XI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask less kindness to be done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to loose these pilgrim shoon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Too early worn and grimed) with sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool deadly touch to these tired feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till days go out which now go on.

XII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to lift the turf unmown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From off the earth where it has grown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cubit-space, and say Behold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creep in, poor Heart, beneath that fold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting how the days go on.


XIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What harm would that do? Green anon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sward would quicken, overshone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By skies as blue; and crickets might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have leave to chirp there day and night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my new rest went on, went on.

XIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From gracious Nature have I won
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such liberal bounty? may I run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, lizard-like, within her side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there be safe, who now am tried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By days that painfully go on?

XV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Voice reproves me thereupon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More sweet than Nature's when the drone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bees is sweetest, and more deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when the rivers overleap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shuddering pines, and thunder on.

XVI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's Voice, not Nature's! Night and noon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sits upon the great white throne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listens for the creatures' praise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What babble we of days and days?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Day-spring He, whose days go on.

XVII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reigns above, He reigns alone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Systems burn out and have his throne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair mists of seraphs melt and fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around Him, changeless amid all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient of Days, whose days go on.

XVIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reigns below, He reigns alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, having life in love forgone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the crown of sovran thorns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reigns the Jealous God. Who mourns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rules with Him, while days go on?

XIX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By anguish which made pale the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear Him charge his saints that none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among his creatures anywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blaspheme against Him with despair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However darkly days go on.

XX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take from my head the thorn-wreath brown!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mortal grief deserves that crown.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O supreme Love, chief misery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp regalia are for Thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose days eternally go on!

XXI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, whatever's undergone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou knowest, willest what is done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief may be joy misunderstood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Good discerns the good.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust Thee while my days go on.

XXII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever's lost, it first was won;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not struggle nor impugn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the cup was broken here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Heaven's new wine might show more clear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I praise Thee while my days go on.

XXIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I praise Thee while my days go on;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love Thee while my days go on:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through dark and dearth, through fire and frost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With emptied arms and treasure lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Thee while my days go on.

XXIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having in thy life-depth thrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being and suffering (which are one),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a child drops his pebble small
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down some deep well, and hears it fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling so I. Thy days go on.

<p>It's endless â€“ the heavy, amber day!<br> Impossible grief, pointless waiting!<br> And the silver-voiced deer, again,<br> Under the Northern Lights, belling.<br> And I think there's cold snow<br> A blue font for the poor and ill,<br> And a little sledge's headlong flow,<br> To the ancient chime of far-off bells.<br></p>

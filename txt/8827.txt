<p>Vous qui nous jugez, savez-vous quel boivre nous avons bu sur la mer?<br> <br> Ogrin the Hermit in old age set forth<br> This tale to them that sought him in the extreme<br> Ancient grey wood where he and silence housed:<br> <br> Long years ago, when yet my sight was keen,<br> My hearing knew the word of wind in bough,<br> And all the low fore-runners of the storm,<br> There reached me, where I sat beneath my thatch,<br> A crash as of tracked quarry in the brake,<br> And storm-flecked, fugitive, with straining breasts<br> And backward eyes and hands inseparable,<br> Tristan and Iseult, swooning at my feet,<br> Sought hiding from their hunters. Here they lay.<br> <br> For pity of their great extremity,<br> Their sin abhorring, yet not them with it,<br> I nourished, hid, and suffered them to build<br> Their branched hut in sight of this grey cross,<br> That haply, falling on their guilty sleep,<br> Its shadow should part them like the blade of God,<br> And they should shudder at each other's eyes.<br> <br> So dwelt they in this solitude with me,<br> And daily, Tristan forth upon the chase,<br> The tender Iseult sought my door and heard<br> The words of holiness. Abashed she heard,<br> Like one in wisdom nurtured from a child,<br> Yet in whose ears an alien language dwells<br> Of some far country whence the traveller brings<br> Magical treasure, and still images<br> Of gods forgotten, and the scent of groves<br> That sleep by painted rivers. As I have seen<br> Oft-times returning pilgrims with the spell<br> Of these lost lands upon their lids, she moved<br> Among familiar truths, accustomed sights,<br> As she to them were strange, not they to her.<br> And often, reasoning with her, have I felt<br> Some ancient lore was in her, dimly drawn<br> &gt;From springs of life beyond the four-fold stream<br> That makes a silver pale to Paradise;<br> For she was calm as some forsaken god<br> Who knows not that his power is passed from him,<br> But sees with tranced eyes rich pilgrim-trains<br> In sands the desert blows about his feet.<br> <br> Abhorring first, I heard her; yet her speech<br> Warred not with pity, or the contrite heart,<br> Or hatred of things evil: rather seemed<br> The utterance of some world where these are not,<br> And the heart lives in heathen innocence<br> With earth's innocuous creatures. For she said:<br> "Love is not, as the shallow adage goes,<br> A witch's filter, brewed to trick the blood.<br> The cup we drank of on the flying deck<br> Was the blue vault of air, the round world's lip,<br> Brimmed with life's hydromel, and pressed to ours<br> By myriad hands of wind and sun and sea.<br> For these are all the cup-bearers of youth,<br> That bend above it at the board of life,<br> Solicitous accomplices: there's not<br> A leaf on bough, a foam-flash on the wave,<br> So brief and glancing but it serves them too;<br> No scent the pale rose spends upon the night,<br> Nor sky-lark's rapture trusted to the blue,<br> But these, from the remotest tides of air<br> Brought in mysterious salvage, breathe and sing<br> In lovers' lips and eyes; and two that drink<br> Thus onely of the strange commingled cup<br> Of mortal fortune shall into their blood<br> Take magic gifts. Upon each others' hearts<br> They shall surprise the heart-beat of the world,<br> And feel a sense of life in things inert;<br> For as love's touch upon the yielded body<br> Is a diviner's wand, and where it falls<br> A hidden treasure trembles: so their eyes,<br> Falling upon the world of clod and brute,<br> And cold hearts plotting evil, shall discern<br> The inextinguishable flame of life<br> That girdles the remotest frame of things<br> With influences older than the stars."<br> <br> So spake Iseult; and thus her passion found<br> Far-flying words, like birds against the sunset<br> That look on lands we see not. Yet I know<br> It was not any argument she found,<br> But that she was, the colour that life took<br> About her, that thus reasoned in her stead,<br> Making her like a lifted lantern borne<br> Through midnight thickets, where the flitting ray<br> Momently from inscrutable darkness draws<br> A myriad-veined branch, and its shy nest<br> Quivering with startled life: so moved Iseult.<br> And all about her this deep solitude<br> Stirred with responsive motions. Oft I knelt<br> In night-long vigil while the lovers slept<br> Under their outlawed thatch, and with long prayers<br> Sought to disarm the indignant heavens; but lo,<br> Thus kneeling in the intertidal hour<br> 'Twixt dark and dawning, have mine eyes beheld<br> How the old gods that hide in these hoar woods,<br> And were to me but shapings of the air,<br> And flit and murmur of the breathing trees,<br> Or slant of moon on pools -- how these stole forth,<br> Grown living presences, yet not of bale,<br> But innocent-eyed as fawns that come to drink,<br> Thronging the threshold where the lovers lay,<br> In service of the great god housed within<br> Who hides in his breast, beneath his mighty plumes,<br> The purposes and penalties of life.<br> Or in yet deeper hours, when all was still,<br> And the hushed air bowed over them alone,<br> Such music of the heart as lovers hear,<br> When close as lips lean, lean the thoughts between --<br> When the cold world, no more a lonely orb<br> Circling the unimagined track of Time,<br> Is like a beating heart within their hands,<br> A numb bird that they warm, and feel its wings --<br> Such music have I heard; and through the prayers<br> Wherewith I sought to shackle their desires,<br> And bring them humbled to the feet of God,<br> Caught the loud quiring of the fruitful year,<br> The leap of springs, the throb of loosened earth,<br> And the sound of all the streams that seek the sea.<br> <br> So fell it, that when pity moved their hearts,<br> And those high lovers, one unto the end,<br> Bowed to the sundering will, and each his way<br> Went through a world that could not make them twain,<br> Knowing that a great vision, passing by,<br> Had swept mine eye-lids with its fringe of fire,<br> I, with the wonder of it on my head,<br> And with the silence of it in my heart,<br> Forth to Tintagel went by secret ways,<br> A long lone journey; and from them that loose<br> Their spiced bales upon the wharves, and shake<br> Strange silks to the sun, or covertly unbosom<br> Rich hoard of pearls and amber, or let drip<br> Through swarthy fingers links of sinuous gold,<br> Chose their most delicate treasures. Though I knew<br> No touch more silken than this knotted gown,<br> My hands, grown tender with the sense of her,<br> Discerned the airiest tissues, light to cling<br> As shower-loosed petals, veils like meadow-smoke,<br> Fur soft as snow, amber like sun congealed,<br> Pearls pink as may-buds in an orb of dew;<br> And laden with these wonders, that to her<br> Were natural as the vesture of a flower,<br> Fared home to lay my booty at her feet.<br> <br> And she, consenting, nor with useless words<br> Proving my purpose, robed herself therein<br> To meet her lawful lord; but while she thus<br> Prisoned the wandering glory of her hair,<br> Dimmed her bright breast with jewels, and subdued<br> Her light to those dull splendours, well she knew<br> The lord that I adorned her thus to meet<br> Was not Tintagel's shadowy King, but he,<br> That other lord beneath whose plumy feet<br> The currents of the seas of life run gold<br> As from eternal sunrise; well she knew<br> That when I laid my hands upon her head,<br> Saying, "Fare forth forgiven," the words I spoke<br> Were the breathings of his pity, who beholds<br> How, swept on his inexorable wings<br> Too far beyond the planetary fires<br> On the last coasts of darkness, plunged too deep<br> In light ineffable, the heart amazed<br> Swoons of its glory, and dropping back to earth<br> Craves the dim shelter of familiar sounds,<br> The rain on the roof, the noise of flocks that pass,<br> And the slow world waking to its daily round. . . .<br> <br> And thus, as one who speeds a banished queen,<br> I set her on my mule, and hung about<br> With royal ornament she went her way;<br> For meet it was that this great Queen should pass<br> Crowned and forgiven from the face of Love.</p>

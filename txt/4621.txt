<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From every quarter of your land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They give God thanks who turned away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death and the needy madmans hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death-fraught, which menaced you that day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One school of many made to make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men who shall hold it dearest right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To battle for their rulers sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stake their being in the fight,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends greeting humble and sincere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though verse be rude and poor and mean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you, the greatest as most dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria, by Gods grace Our Queen!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such greeting as should come from those
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose fathers faced the Sepoy hordes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or served you in the Russian snows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, dying, left their sons their swords.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of us have fought for you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already in the Afghan pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or where the scarce-seen smoke-puffs flew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Boer marksmen in the grass;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all are bred to do your will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By land and sea, wherever flies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Flag, to fight and follow still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And work your Empires destinies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more we greet you, though unseen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our greeting be, and coming slow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust us, if need arise, O Queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not tarry with the blow!

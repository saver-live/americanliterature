<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Calidore is paddling o'er the lake;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His healthful spirit eager and awake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel the beauty of a silent eve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seem'd full loath this happy world to leave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiles at the far clearness all around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until his heart is well nigh over wound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turns for calmness to the pleasant green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of easy slopes, and shadowy trees that lean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So elegantly o'er the waters' brim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show their blossoms trim.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce can his clear and nimble eye-sight follow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freaks, and dartings of the black-wing'd swallow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delighting much, to see it half at rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dip so refreshingly its wings, and breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Gainst the smooth surface, and to mark anon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The widening circles into nothing gone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the sharp keel of his little boat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes up with ripple, and with easy float,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And glides into a bed of water lillies:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad leav'd are they and their white canopies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are upward turn'd to catch the heavens' dew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near to a little island's point they grew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this sweet spot of earth. The bowery shore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went off in gentle windings to the hoar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And light blue mountains: but no breathing man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a warm heart, and eye prepared to scan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature's clear beauty, could pass lightly by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects that look'd out so invitingly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On either side. These, gentle Calidore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greeted, as he had known them long before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sidelong view of swelling leafiness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the glad setting sun, in gold doth dress;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence ever, and anon the jay outsprings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scales upon the beauty of its wings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lonely turret, shatter'd, and outworn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands venerably proud; too proud to mourn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its long lost grandeur: fir trees grow around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little chapel with the cross above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upholding wreaths of ivy; the white dove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That on the windows spreads his feathers light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green tufted islands casting their soft shades
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the lake; sequesterd leafy glades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That through the dimness of their twilight show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large dock leaves, spiral foxgloves, or the glow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wild cats eyes, or the silvery stems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of delicate birch trees, or long grass which hems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little brook. The youth had long been viewing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pleasant things, and heaven was bedewing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain flowers, when his glad senses caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trumpet's silver voice. Ah! it was fraught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many joys for him: the warder's ken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had found white coursers prancing in the glen:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends very dear to him he soon will see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So pushes off his boat most eagerly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon upon the lake he skims along,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deaf to the nightingales first under-song;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit flies before him so completely.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he turns a jutting point of land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence may be seen the castle gloomy, and grand:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the point of his light shallop reaches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those marble steps that through the water dip:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now over them he goes with hasty trip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon he leaps along the oaken floors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of halls and corridors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delicious sounds! those little bright-eyed things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That float about the air on azure wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of clattering hoofs; into the court he sprang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from beneath the threat'ning portcullis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They brought their happy burthens. What a kiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What gentle squeeze he gave each lady's hand!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How tremblingly their delicate ancles spannd!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While whisperings of affection
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made him delay to let their tender feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to the earth; with an incline so sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whether there were tears of languishment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that the evening dew had pearl'd their tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lips that tremble, and with glistening eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the soft luxury
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair as some wonder out of fairy land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of whitest Cassia, fresh from summer showers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this he fondled with his happy cheek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if for joy he would no further seek;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to his ear, like something from beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His present being: so he gently drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank'd heaven that his joy was never ending;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While 'gainst his forehead he devoutly press'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hand heaven made to succour the distress'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hand that from the world's bleak promontory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the pages, and the torches' glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood a knight, patting the flowing hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his proud horse's mane: he was withal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of elegance, and stature tall:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the waving of his plumes would be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High as the berries of a wild ash tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as the winged cap of Mercury.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His armour was so dexterously wrought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shape, that sure no living man had thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hard, and heavy steel: but that indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was some glorious form, some splendid weed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which a spirit new come from the skies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might live, and show itself to human eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis the far-fam'd, the brave Sir Gondibert,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the good man to Calidore alert;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the young warrior with a step of grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came up, a courtly smile upon his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mailed hand held out, ready to greet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large-eyed wonder, and ambitious heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the aspiring boy; who as he led
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those smiling ladies, often turned his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To admire the visor arched so gracefully
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a knightly brow; while they went by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamps that from the high-roof'd hall were pendent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave the steel a shining quite transcendent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon in a pleasant chamber they are seated;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet-lipp'd ladies have already greeted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the green leaves that round the window clamber,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show their purple stars, and bells of amber.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Gondibert has doff'd his shining steel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gladdening in the free, and airy feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a light mantle; and while Clerimond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is looking round about him with a fond,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And placid eye, young Calidore is burning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear of knightly deeds, and gallant spurning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all unworthiness; and how the strong of arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept off dismay, and terror, and alarm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From lovely woman: while brimful of this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave each damsel's hand so warm a kiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had such manly ardour in his eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That each at other look'd half staringly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then their features started into smiles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet as blue heavens o'er enchanted isles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly the breezes from the forest came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly they blew aside the taper's flame;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear was the song from Philomel's far bower;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grateful the incense from the lime-tree flower;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious, wild, the far-heard trumpet's tone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely the moon in ether, all alone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet too the converse of these happy mortals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As that of busy spirits when the portals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are closing in the west; or that soft humming
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear around when Hesperus is coming.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet be their sleep.

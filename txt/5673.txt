&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In broad daylight, and at noon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I saw the moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing high, but faint and white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a school-boy's paper kite.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In broad daylight, yesterday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read a Poet's mystic lay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seemed to me at most
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a phantom, or a ghost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at length the feverish day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a passion died away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the night, serene and still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell on village, vale, and hill.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the moon, in all her pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a spirit glorified,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled and overflowed the night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With revelations of her light.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Poet's song again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed like music through my brain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night interpreted to me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its grace and mystery.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Heart, be at peace, because
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor knave nor dolt can break
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whats not for their applause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being for a womans sake.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough if the work has seemed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did she your strength renew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dream that a lion had dreamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the wilderness cried aloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secret between you two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the proud and the proud.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, still you would have their praise!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But heres a haughtier text,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labyrinth of her days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That her own strangeness perplexed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how what her dreaming gave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earned slander, ingratitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From self-same dolt and knave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, and worse wrong than these.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet she, singing upon her road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half lion, half child, is at peace.
</pre>

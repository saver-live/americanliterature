<p> A narrow fellow in the grass<br> Occasionally rides;<br> You may have met him—did you not<br> His notice sudden is,<br> The grass divides as with a comb,<br> A spotted shaft is seen,<br> And then it closes at your feet,<br> And opens further on.<br> <br> He likes a boggy acre, <br> A floor too cool for corn,<br> But when a boy and barefoot,<br> I more than once at noon<br> Have passed, I thought, a whip lash,<br> Unbraiding in the sun,<br> When stooping to secure it,<br> It wrinkled and was gone.<br> <br> Several of nature’s people<br> I know, and they know me;<br> I feel for them a transport<br> Of cordiality.<br> But never met this fellow,<br> Attended or alone,<br> Without a tighter breathing,<br> And zero at the bone.<br> </p>

<p>SOMEWHERE I read, in an old book whose name<br> Is gone from me, I read that when the days<br> Of a man are counted, and his business done,<br> There comes up the shore at evening, with the tide,<br> To the place where he sits, a boat --<br> And in the boat, from the place where he sits, he sees,<br> Dim in the dusk, dim and yet so familiar,<br> The faces of his friends long dead; and knows<br> They come for him, brought in upon the tide,<br> To take him where men go at set of day.<br> Then rising, with his hands in theirs, he goes<br> Between them his last steps, that are the first<br> Of the new life -- and with the ebb they pass,<br> Their shaken sail grown small upon the moon.<br> <br> Often I thought of this, and pictured me<br> How many a man who lives with throngs about him,<br> Yet straining through the twilight for that boat<br> Shall scarce make out one figure in the stern,<br> And that so faint its features shall perplex him<br> With doubtful memories -- and his heart hang back.<br> But others, rising as they see the sail<br> Increase upon the sunset, hasten down,<br> Hands out and eyes elated; for they see<br> Head over head, crowding from bow to stern,<br> Repeopling their long loneliness with smiles,<br> The faces of their friends; and such go forth<br> Content upon the ebb tide, with safe hearts.<br> <br> But never<br> To worker summoned when his day was done<br> Did mounting tide bring in such freight of friends<br> As stole to you up the white wintry shingle<br> That night while they that watched you thought you slept.<br> Softly they came, and beached the boat, and gathered<br> In the still cove under the icy stars,<br> Your last-born, and the dear loves of your heart,<br> And all men that have loved right more than ease,<br> And honor above honors; all who gave<br> Free-handed of their best for other men,<br> And thought their giving taking: they who knew<br> Man's natural state is effort, up and up --<br> All these were there, so great a company<br> Perchance you marveled, wondering what great ship<br> Had brought that throng unnumbered to the cove<br> Where the boys used to beach their light canoe<br> After old happy picnics --<br> <br> But these, your friends and children, to whose hands<br> Committed, in the silent night you rose<br> And took your last faint steps --<br> These led you down, O great American,<br> Down to the winter night and the white beach,<br> And there you saw that the huge hull that waited<br> Was not as are the boats of the other dead,<br> Frail craft for a brief passage; no, for this<br> Was first of a long line of towering transports,<br> Storm-worn and ocean-weary every one,<br> The ships you launched, the ships you manned, the ships<br> That now, returning from their sacred quest<br> With the thrice-sacred burden of their dead,<br> Lay waiting there to take you forth with them,<br> Out with the ebb tide, on some farther quest.</p>

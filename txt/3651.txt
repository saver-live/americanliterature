<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws of God, the laws of man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may keep that will and can;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let God and man decree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws for themselves and not for me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if my ways are not as theirs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them mind their own affairs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their deeds I judge and much condemn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet when did I make laws for them?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please yourselves, say I, and they
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need only look the other way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no, they will not; they must still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrest their neighbour to their will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make me dance as they desire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With jail and gallows and hell-fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how am I to face the odds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mans bedevilment and Gods?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, a stranger and afraid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a world I never made.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be master, right or wrong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though both are foolish, both are strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since, my soul, we cannot fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Saturn or Mercury,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep we must, if keep we can,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These foreign laws of God and man.

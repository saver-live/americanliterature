<p>NOT that on me the Cyprian fury fell,<br> Last martyr of my love-ensanguined race;<br> Not that my children drop the averted face<br> When my name shames the silence; not that hell<br> Holds me where nevermore his glance shall dwell<br> Nightlong between my lids, my pulses race<br> Through flying pines the tempest of the chase,<br> Nor my heart rest with him beside the well.<br> <br> Not that he hates me; not, O baffled gods --<br> Not that I slew him! -- yet, because your goal<br> Is always reached, nor your rejoicing rods<br> Fell ever yet upon insensate clods,<br> Know, the one pang that makes your triumph whole<br> Is, that he knows the baseness of my soul.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were my companions going forth by night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Chil! Look you, for Chil!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now come I to whistle them the ending of the fight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Chil! Vanguards of Chil!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Word they gave me overhead of quarry newly slain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Word I gave them underfoot of buck upon the plain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heres an end of every trail they shall not speak again!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They that cried the hunting-cry they that followed fast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Chil! Look you, for Chil!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They that bade the sambhur wheel, or pinned him as he passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Chil! Vanguards of Chil!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They that lagged behind the scent they that ran before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They that shunned the level horn they that over-bore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heres an end of every trail they shall not follow more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were my companions. Pity twas they died!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Chil! Look you, for Chil!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now come I to comfort them that knew them in their pride.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Chil! Vanguards of Chil!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tattered flank and sunken eye, open mouth and red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locked and lank and lone they lie, the dead upon their dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heres an end of every trail and here my hosts are fed!

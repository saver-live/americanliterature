<p> Misted the flowers weep as light dies<br> Moon of white silk sleeplessly cries.<br> Stilled - Phoenix wings.<br> Touched - Mandarin strings.<br> <br> This song tells secrets that no one knows<br> To far Yenjan on Spring breeze it goes.<br> To you it flies <br> Through the night skies.<br> <br> Sidelong - Eyes. How<br> White tears fill now!<br> Heart's pain? Come see -<br> In this mirror with me. <br> </p>

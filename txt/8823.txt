<p>FRA PAOLO, since they say the end is near,<br> And you of all men have the gentlest eyes,<br> Most like our father Francis; since you know<br> How I have toiled and prayed and scourged and striven,<br> Mothered the orphan, waked beside the sick,<br> Gone empty that mine enemy might eat,<br> Given bread for stones in famine years, and channelled<br> With vigilant knees the pavement of this cell,<br> Till I constrained the Christ upon the wall<br> To bend His thorn-crowned Head in mute forgiveness . . .<br> Three times He bowed it . . . (but the whole stands writ,<br> Sealed with the Bishop's signet, as you know),<br> Once for each person of the Blessed Three--<br> A miracle that the whole town attests,<br> The very babes thrust forward for my blessing,<br> And either parish plotting for my bones--<br> Since this you know: sit near and bear with me.<br> <br> I have lain here, these many empty days<br> I thought to pack with Credos and Hail Marys<br> So close that not a fear should force the door--<br> But still, between the blessed syllables<br> That taper up like blazing angel heads,<br> Praise over praise, to the Unutterable,<br> Strange questions clutch me, thrusting fiery arms,<br> As though, athwart the close-meshed litanies,<br> My dead should pluck at me from hell, with eyes<br> Alive in their obliterated faces! . . .<br> I have tried the saints' names and our blessed Mother's<br> Fra Paolo, I have tried them o'er and o'er,<br> And like a blade bent backward at first thrust<br> They yield and fail me--and the questions stay.<br> And so I thought, into some human heart,<br> Pure, and yet foot-worn with the tread of sin,<br> If only I might creep for sanctuary,<br> It might be that those eyes would let me rest. . .<br> <br> Fra Paolo, listen. How should I forget<br> The day I saw him first? (You know the one.)<br> I had been laughing in the market-place<br> With others like me, I the youngest there,<br> Jostling about a pack of mountebanks<br> Like flies on carrion (I the youngest there!),<br> Till darkness fell; and while the other girls<br> Turned this way, that way, as perdition beckoned,<br> I, wondering what the night would bring, half hoping:<br> _If not, this once, a child's sleep in my garret,_<br> _At least enough to buy that two-pronged coral_<br> _The others covet 'gainst the evil eye,_<br> _Since, after all, one sees that I'm the youngest_--<br> So, muttering my litany to hell<br> (The only prayer I knew that was not Latin),<br> Felt on my arm a touch as kind as yours,<br> And heard a voice as kind as yours say "Come."<br> I turned and went; and from that day I never<br> Looked on the face of any other man.<br> So much is known; so much effaced; the sin<br> Cast like a plague-struck body to the sea,<br> Deep, deep into the unfathomable pardon--<br> (The Head bowed thrice, as the whole town attests).<br> What more, then? To what purpose? Bear with me!--<br> <br> It seems that he, a stranger in the place,<br> First noted me that afternoon and wondered:<br> _How grew so white a bud in such black slime,_<br> _And why not mine the hand to pluck it out?_<br> Why, so Christ deals with souls, you cry--what then?<br> Not so! Not so! When Christ, the heavenly gardener,<br> Plucks flowers for Paradise (do I not know?),<br> He snaps the stem above the root, and presses<br> The ransomed soul between two convent walls,<br> A lifeless blossom in the Book of Life.<br> But when my lover gathered me, he lifted<br> Stem, root and all--ay, and the clinging mud--<br> And set me on his sill to spread and bloom<br> After the common way, take sun and rain,<br> And make a patch of brightness for the street,<br> Though raised above rough fingers--so you make<br> A weed a flower, and others, passing, think:<br> "Next ditch I cross, I'll lift a root from it,<br> And dress my window" . . . and the blessing spreads.<br> Well, so I grew, with every root and tendril<br> Grappling the secret anchorage of his love,<br> And so we loved each other till he died. . . .<br> <br> Ah, that black night he left me, that dead dawn<br> I found him lying in the woods, alive<br> To gasp my name out and his life-blood with it,<br> As though the murderer's knife had probed for me<br> In his hacked breast and found me in each wound. . .<br> Well, it was there Christ came to me, you know,<br> And led me home--just as that other led me.<br> _(Just as that other?_ Father, bear with me!)<br> My lover's death, they tell me, saved my soul,<br> And I have lived to be a light to men.<br> And gather sinners to the knees of grace.<br> All this, you say, the Bishop's signet covers.<br> But stay! Suppose my lover had not died?<br> (At last my question! Father, help me face it.)<br> I say: Suppose my lover had not died--<br> Think you I ever would have left him living,<br> Even to be Christ's blessed Margaret?<br> --We lived in sin? Why, to the sin I died to<br> That other was as Paradise, when God<br> Walks there at eventide, the air pure gold,<br> And angels treading all the grass to flowers!<br> He was my Christ--he led me out of hell--<br> He died to save me (so your casuists say!)--<br> Could Christ do more? Your Christ out-pity mine?<br> Why, _yours_ but let the sinner bathe His feet;<br> Mine raised her to the level of his heart. . .<br> And then Christ's way is saving, as man's way<br> Is squandering--and the devil take the shards!<br> But this man kept for sacramental use<br> The cup that once had slaked a passing thirst;<br> This man declared: "The same clay serves to model<br> A devil or a saint; the scribe may stain<br> The same fair parchment with obscenities,<br> Or gild with benedictions; nay," he cried,<br> "Because a satyr feasted in this wood,<br> And fouled the grasses with carousing foot,<br> Shall not a hermit build his chapel here<br> And cleanse the echoes with his litanies?<br> The sodden grasses spring again--why not<br> The trampled soul? Is man less merciful<br> Than nature, good more fugitive than grass?"<br> And so--if, after all, he had not died,<br> And suddenly that door should know his hand,<br> And with that voice as kind as yours he said:<br> "Come, Margaret, forth into the sun again,<br> Back to the life we fashioned with our hands<br> Out of old sins and follies, fragments scorned<br> Of more ambitious builders, yet by Love,<br> The patient architect, so shaped and fitted<br> That not a crevice let the winter in--"<br> Think you my bones would not arise and walk,<br> This bruised body (as once the bruised soul)<br> Turn from the wonders of the seventh heaven<br> As from the antics of the market-place?<br> If this could be (as I so oft have dreamed),<br> I, who have known both loves, divine and human,<br> Think you I would not leave this Christ for that?<br> <br> --I rave, you say? You start from me, Fra Paolo?<br> Go, then; your going leaves me not alone.<br> I marvel, rather, that I feared the question,<br> Since, now I name it, it draws near to me<br> With such dear reassurance in its eyes,<br> And takes your place beside me. . .<br> <br> Nay, I tell you,<br> Fra Paolo, I have cried on all the saints--<br> If this be devil's prompting, let them drown it<br> In Alleluias! Yet not one replies.<br> And, for the Christ there--is He silent too?<br> _Your_ Christ? Poor father; you that have but one,<br> And that one silent--how I pity you!<br> He will not answer? Will not help you cast<br> The devil out? But hangs there on the wall,<br> Blind wood and bone--?<br> <br> How if _I_ call on Him--<br> I, whom He talks with, as the town attests?<br> If ever prayer hath ravished me so high<br> That its wings failed and dropped me in Thy breast,<br> Christ, I adjure Thee! By that naked hour<br> Of innermost commixture, when my soul<br> Contained Thee as the paten holds the host,<br> Judge Thou alone between this priest and me;<br> Nay, rather, Lord, between my past and present,<br> Thy Margaret and that other's--whose she is<br> By right of salvage--and whose call should follow!<br> Thine? Silent still.--Or his, who stooped to her,<br> And drew her to Thee by the bands of love?<br> Not Thine? Then his?<br> <br> Ah, Christ--the thorn-crowned Head<br> Bends . . . bends again . . . down on your knees,<br> <br> Fra Paolo!<br> If his, then Thine!<br> <br> Kneel, priest, for this is heaven. . .</p>

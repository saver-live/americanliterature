&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tempora labuntur, tacitisque senescimus annis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et fugiunt freno non remorante dies.--OVID, Fastorum, Lib. vi.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Caesar, we who are about to die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salute you!" was the gladiators' cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the arena, standing face to face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With death and with the Roman populace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O ye familiar scenes,--ye groves of pine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That once were mine and are no longer mine,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou river, widening through the meadows green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the vast sea, so near and yet unseen,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye halls, in whose seclusion and repose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phantoms of fame, like exhalations, rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vanished,--we who are about to die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salute you; earth and air and sea and sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Imperial Sun that scatters down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sovereign splendors upon grove and town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye do not answer us! ye do not hear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are forgotten; and in your austere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And calm indifference, ye little care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we come or go, or whence or where.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What passing generations fill these halls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What passing voices echo front these walls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye heed not; we are only as the blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment heard, and then forever past.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so the teachers who in earlier days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led our bewildered feet through learning's maze;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They answer us--alas! what have I said?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What greetings come there from the voiceless dead?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What salutation, welcome, or reply?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What pressure from the hands that lifeless lie?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are no longer here; they all are gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the land of shadows,--all save one.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honor and reverence, and the good repute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That follows faithful service as its fruit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be unto him, whom living we salute.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great Italian poet, when he made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dreadful journey to the realms of shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met there the old instructor of his youth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cried in tones of pity and of ruth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, never from the memory of my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dear, paternal image shall depart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who while on earth, ere yet by death surprised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taught me how mortals are immortalized;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How grateful am I for that patient care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my life long my language shall declare."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day we make the poet's words our own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And utter them in plaintive undertone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor to the living only be they said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to the other living called the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose dear, paternal images appear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not wrapped in gloom, but robed in sunshine here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose simple lives, complete and without flaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were part and parcel of great Nature's law;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who said not to their Lord, as if afraid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is thy talent in a napkin laid,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But labored in their sphere, as men who live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the delight that work alone can give.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace be to them; eternal peace and rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fulfilment of the great behest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye have been faithful over a few things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over ten cities shall ye reign as kings."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ye who fill the places we once filled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And follow in the furrows that we tilled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young men, whose generous hearts are beating high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We who are old, and are about to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salute you; hail you; take your hands in ours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crown you with our welcome as with flowers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its illusions, aspirations, dreams!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Book of Beginnings, Story without End,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each maid a heroine, and each man a friend!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aladdin's Lamp, and Fortunatus' Purse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That holds the treasures of the universe!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All possibilities are in its hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No danger daunts it, and no foe withstands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its sublime audacity of faith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be thou removed!" it to the mountain saith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with ambitious feet, secure and proud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascends the ladder leaning on the cloud!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ancient Priam at the Scaean gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat on the walls of Troy in regal state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the old men, too old and weak to fight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chirping like grasshoppers in their delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the embattled hosts, with spear and shield,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Trojans and Achaians in the field;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the snowy summits of our years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see you in the plain, as each appears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And question of you; asking, "Who is he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That towers above the others?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which may be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atreides, Menelaus, Odysseus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ajax the great, or bold Idomeneus?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him not boast who puts his armor on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he who puts it off, the battle done.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study yourselves; and most of all note well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein kind Nature meant you to excel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every blossom ripens into fruit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minerva, the inventress of the flute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flung it aside, when she her face surveyed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distorted in a fountain as she played;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unlucky Marsyas found it, and his fate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was one to make the bravest hesitate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write on your doors the saying wise and old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be bold! be bold!" and everywhere--"Be bold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be not too bold!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet better the excess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the defect; better the more than less;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better like Hector in the field to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than like a perfumed Paris turn and fly,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, my classmates; ye remaining few
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That number not the half of those we knew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye, against whose familiar names not yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fatal asterisk of death is set,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye I salute!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horologe of Time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strikes the half-century with a solemn chime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And summons us together once again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy of meeting not unmixed with pain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the others?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices from the deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caverns of darkness answer me: "They sleep!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I name no names; instinctively I feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each at some well-remembered grave will kneel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every heart best knoweth its own loss.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see their scattered gravestones gleaming white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the pale dusk of the impending night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er all alike the impartial sunset throws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its golden lilies mingled with the rose;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We give to each a tender thought, and pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the graveyards with their tangled grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto these scenes frequented by our feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were young, and life was fresh and sweet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall I say to you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than silence is?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I survey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This throng of faces turned to meet my own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendly and fair, and yet to me unknown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transformed the very landscape seems to be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same, yet not the same to me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many memories crowd upon my brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many ghosts are in the wooded plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fain would steal away, with noiseless tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a house where some one lieth dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot go;--I pause;--I hesitate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My feet reluctant linger at the gate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who struggles in a troubled dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak and cannot, to myself I seem.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanish the dream! Vanish the idle fears!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanish the rolling mists of fifty years!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever time or space may intervene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be a stranger in this scene.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here every doubt, all indecision, ends;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, my companions, comrades, classmates, friends!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! the fifty years since last we met
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem to me fifty folios bound and set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Time, the great transcriber, on his shelves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein are written the histories of ourselves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What tragedies, what comedies, are there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What joy and grief, what rapture and despair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What chronicles of triumph and defeat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of struggle, and temptation, and retreat!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What records of regrets, and doubts, and fears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What pages blotted, blistered by our tears!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What lovely landscapes on the margin shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sweet, angelic faces, what divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And holy images of love and trust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undimmed by age, unsoiled by damp or dust!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose hand shall dare to open and explore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These volumes, closed and clasped forevermore?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reverential feet I pass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear a voice that cries, "Alas! alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever hath been written shall remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor be erased nor written o'er again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unwritten only still belongs to thee:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take heed, and ponder well what that shall be."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As children frightened by a thundercloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are reassured if some one reads aloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale of wonder, with enchantment fraught,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wild adventure, that diverts their thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me endeavor with a tale to chase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gathering shadows of the time and place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And banish what we all too deeply feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wholly to say, or wholly to conceal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mediaeval Rome, I know not where,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood an image with its arm in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on its lifted finger, shining clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden ring with the device, "Strike here!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greatly the people wondered, though none guessed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning that these words but half expressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a learned clerk, who at noonday
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With downcast eyes was passing on his way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused, and observed the spot, and marked it well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon the shadow of the finger fell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, coming back at midnight, delved, and found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secret stairway leading under ground.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down this he passed into a spacious hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit by a flaming jewel on the wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And opposite in threatening attitude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bow and shaft a brazen statue stood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its forehead, like a coronet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were these mysterious words of menace set:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That which I am, I am; my fatal aim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None can escape, not even yon luminous flame!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midway the hall was a fair table placed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With cloth of gold, and golden cups enchased
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rubies, and the plates and knives were gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gold the bread and viands manifold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around it, silent, motionless, and sad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were seated gallant knights in armor clad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ladies beautiful with plume and zone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they were stone, their hearts within were stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the vast hall was filled in every part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With silent crowds, stony in face and heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long at the scene, bewildered and amazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trembling clerk in speechless wonder gazed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from the table, by his greed made bold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seized a goblet and a knife of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suddenly from their seats the guests upsprang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archer sped his arrow, at their call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shattering the lambent jewel on the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all was dark around and overhead;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stark on the door the luckless clerk lay dead!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer of this legend then records
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its ghostly application in these words:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image is the Adversary old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose beckoning finger points to realms of gold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lusts and passions are the downward stair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads the soul from a diviner air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archer, Death; the flaming jewel, Life;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrestrial goods, the goblet and the knife;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights and ladies, all whose flesh and bone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By avarice have been hardened into stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk, the scholar whom the love of pelf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tempts from his books and from his nobler self.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scholar and the world!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless strife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discord in the harmonies of life!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love of learning, the sequestered nooks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the sweet serenity of books;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market-place, the eager love of gain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose aim is vanity, and whose end is pain!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why, you ask me, should this tale be told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To men grown old, or who are growing old?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too late!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, nothing is too late
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cato learned Greek at eighty; Sophocles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrote his grand Oedipus, and Simonides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore off the prize of verse from his compeers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When each had numbered more than fourscore years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Theophrastus, at fourscore and ten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had but begun his Characters of Men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaucer, at Woodstock with the nightingales,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sixty wrote the Canterbury Tales;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goethe at Weimar, toiling to the last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completed Faust when eighty years were past.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are indeed exceptions; but they show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far the gulf-stream of our youth may flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the arctic regions of our lives.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where little else than life itself survives.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the barometer foretells the storm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While still the skies are clear, the weather warm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So something in us, as old age draws near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betrays the pressure of the atmosphere.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nimble mercury, ere we are aware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descends the elastic ladder of the air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telltale blood in artery and vein
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinks from its higher levels in the brain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever poet, orator, or sage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May say of it, old age is still old age.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the waning, not the crescent moon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dusk of evening, not the blaze of noon:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not strength, but weakness; not desire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But its surcease; not the fierce heat of fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning and consuming element,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that of ashes and of embers spent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which some living sparks we still discern,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough to warm, but not enough to burn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we sit idly down and say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night hath come; it is no longer day?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night hath not yet come; we are not quite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut off from labor by the failing light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something remains for us to do or dare;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the oldest tree some fruit may bear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Oedipus Coloneus, or Greek Ode,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or tales of pilgrims that one morning rode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the gateway of the Tabard inn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other something, would we but begin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For age is opportunity no less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than youth itself, though in another dress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the evening twilight fades away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day.

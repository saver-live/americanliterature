<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh stay at home, my lad, and plough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land and not the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the soldiers at their drill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all about the idle hill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shepherd your sheep with me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh stay with company and mirth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And daylight and the air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too full already is the grave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fellows that were good and brave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And died because they were.

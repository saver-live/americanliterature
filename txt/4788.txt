<pre>Seven Watchmen sitting in a tower,
Watching what had come upon mankind,
Showed the Man the Glory and the Power,
And bade him shape the Kingdom to his mind.
"All things on Earth your will shall win you."
('Twas so their council ran)
"But the Kingdom, the Kingdom is within you,"
Said the Man's own mind to the Man.
For time, and some time,
As it was in the bitter years before
So it shall be in the over-sweetened hour,
That a man's mind is wont to tell him more
Than Seven Watchmen sitting in a tower.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As late I rambled in the happy fields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time the skylark shakes the tremulous dew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his lush clover covert; when anew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adventurous knights take up their dinted shields;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the sweetest flower wild nature yields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fresh-blown musk-rose; 'twas the first that threw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its sweets upon the summer: graceful it grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the wand that Queen Titania wields.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as I feasted on its fragrancy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought the garden-rose it far excelled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when, O Wells! thy roses came to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sense with their deliciousness was spelled:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft voices had they, that with tender plea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered of peace, and truth, and friendliness unquelled.

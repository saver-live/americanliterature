<p>Did Chuang Chou dream he was the butterfly?<br> Or the butterfly dream he was Chuang Chou?<br> In the single body's transformations<br> See the vortex of the Myriad Creatures.<br> No mystery then that the Magic Seas<br> Shrank again to crystal streams,<br> Or down by Ch'ang-an's Green Gate<br> The gardener was Marquis of Tung-Ling.<br> If this is the fate of fame and power,<br> What is it for- this endless striving? <br></p>

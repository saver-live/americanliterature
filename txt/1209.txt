<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English have a scornful insular way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of calling the French light. The levity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is in the judgment only, which yet stands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For say a foolish thing but oft enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And here's the secret of a hundred creeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men get opinions as boys learn to spell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By reiteration chiefly), the same thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall pass at last for absolutely wise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not with fools exclusively. And so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say the French are light, as if we said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat mews or the milch-cow gives us milk:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say rather, cats are milked and milch-cows mew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what is lightness but inconsequence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vague fluctuation 'twixt effect and cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compelled by neither? Is a bullet light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dashes from the gun-mouth, while the eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winks and the heart beats one, to flatten itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a wafer on the white speck on a wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred paces off? Even so direct,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sternly undivertible of aim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this French people.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All, idealists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too absolute and earnest, with them all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of a knife cuts real flesh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still, devouring the safe interval
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Nature placed between the thought and act
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those two fiery and impatient souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They threaten conflagration to the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rush with most unscrupulous logic on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible practice. Set your orators
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To blow upon them with loud windy mouths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through watchword phrases, jest or sentiment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which drive our burly brutal English mobs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like so much chaff, whichever way they blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light French people will not thus be driven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turn indeed, but then they turn upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some central pivot of their thought and choice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And veer out by the force of holding fast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's hard to understand, for Englishmen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused to abstract questions, and untrained
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To trace the involutions, valve by valve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each orbed bulb-root of a general truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mark what subtly fine integument
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divides opposed compartments. Freedom's self
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes concrete to us, to be understood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed in a feudal form incarnately
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suit our ways of thought and reverence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special form, with us, being still the thing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With us, I say, though I'm of Italy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mother's birth and grave, by father's grave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And memory; let it be a poet's heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can swell to a pair of nationalities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However ill-lodged in a woman's breast.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I am strong to love this noble France,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poet of the nations, who dreams on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wails on (while the household goes to wreck)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever, after some ideal good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some equal poise of sex, some unvowed love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inviolate, some spontaneous brotherhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some wealth that leaves none poor and finds none tired,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some freedom of the many that respects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wisdom of the few. Heroic dreams!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublime, to dream so; natural, to wake:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sad, to use such lofty scaffoldings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erected for the building of a church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build instead a brothel or a prison
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May God save France!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if at last she sighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her great soul up into a great man's face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To flush his temples out so gloriously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That few dare carp at Cæsar for being bald,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then? this Cæsar represents, not reigns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is no despot, though twice absolute:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Head has all the people for a heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This purple's lined with the democracy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let him see to it! for a rent within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would leave irreparable rags without.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious riddle: find such anywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in France; and when 'tis found in France,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to read it rightly. So, I mused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and down, up and down, the terraced streets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glittering boulevards, the white colonnades
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fair fantastic Paris who wears trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like plumes, as if man made them, spire and tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they had grown by nature, tossing up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her fountains in the sunshine of the squares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if in beauty's game she tossed the dice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or blew the silver down-balls of her dreams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sow futurity with seeds of thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And count the passage of her festive hours.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city swims in verdure, beautiful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Venice on the waters, the sea-swan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What bosky gardens dropped in close-walled courts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like plums in ladies' laps who start and laugh:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What miles of streets that run on after trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still carrying all the necessary shops,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those open caskets with the jewels seen!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trade is art, and art's philosophy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Paris. There's a silk for instance, there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As worth an artist's study for the folds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As that bronze opposite! nay, the bronze has faults,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art's here too artful, conscious as a maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who leans to mark her shadow on the wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until she lose a vantage in her step.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Art walks forward, and knows where to walk;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artists also are idealists,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too absolute for nature, logical
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To austerity in the application of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special theory, not a soul content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To paint a crooked pollard and an ass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the English will because they find it so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like it somehow. There the old Tuileries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is pulling its high cap down on its eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confounded, conscience-stricken, and amazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the apparition of a new fair face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those devouring mirrors. Through the grate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the gardens, what a heap of babes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept up like leaves beneath the chestnut-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From every street and alley of the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By ghosts perhaps that blow too bleak this way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-looking for their heads! dear pretty babes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish them luck to have their ball-play out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the next change. Here the air is thronged
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With statues poised upon their columns fine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to stand a moment were a feat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against that blue! What squares, what breathing-room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a nation that runs fast, ay, runs against
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dentist's teeth at the corner in pale rows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which grin at progress, in an epigram.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked the day out, listening to the chink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the first Napoleon's bones in his second grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By victories guarded 'neath the golden dome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That caps all Paris like a bubble. "Shall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These dry bones live?" thought Louis Philippe once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lived to know. Herein is argument
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For kings and politicians, but still more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For poets, who bear buckets to the well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ampler draught.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These crowds are very good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For meditation (when we are very strong)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though love of beauty makes us timorous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And draws us backward from the coarse town-sights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To count the daisies upon dappled fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the streams bleat on among the hills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In innocent and indolent repose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While still with silken elegiac thoughts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wind out from us the distracting world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And die into the chrysalis of a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the best that may, to come of us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some brown moth. I would be bold and bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look into the swarthiest face of things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For God's sake who has made them.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six days' work;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last day shutting 'twixt its dawn and eve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole work bettered of the previous five!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since God collected and resumed in man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firmaments, the strata, and the lights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish, fowl, and beast, and insect, all their trains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of various life caught back upon His arm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reorganised, and constituted man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The microcosm, the adding up of works,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within whose fluttering nostrils, then at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consummating Himself the Maker sighed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some strong winner at the foot-race sighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the goal.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity is great;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if I would not rather pore upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ounce of common, ugly, human dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An artisan's palm or a peasant's brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsmooth, ignoble, save to me and God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than track old Nilus to his silver roots,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wait on all the changes of the moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the mountain-peaks of Thessaly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Until her magic crystal round itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many a witch to see in) set it down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As weakness, strength by no means. How is this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That men of science, osteologists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And surgeons, beat some poets in respect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nature, count nought common or unclean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spend raptures upon perfect specimens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of indurated veins, distorted joints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or beautiful new cases of curved spine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we, we are shocked at nature's falling off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We dare to shrink back from her warts and blains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not, when she sneezes, look at her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even to say "God bless her"? That's our wrong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that, she will not trust us often with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her larger sense of beauty and desire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tethers us to a lily or a rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bids us diet on the dew inside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left ignorant that the hungry beggar-boy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who stares unseen against our absent eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wonders at the gods that we must be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pass so careless for the oranges!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bears yet a breastful of a fellow-world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this world, undisparaged, undespoiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And (while we scorn him for a flower or two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As being, Heaven help us, less poetical)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contains himself both flowers and firmaments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And surging seas and aspectable stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that we would push him out of sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to see nearer. Let us pray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's grace to keep God's image in repute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That so, the poet and philanthropist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Even I and Romney) may stand side by side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we both stand face to face with men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemplating the people in the rough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet each so follow a vocation, his
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mine.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked on, musing with myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On life and art, and whether after all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A larger metaphysics might not help
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our physics, a completer poetry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust our daily life and vulgar wants
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fully than the special outside plans,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phalansteries, material institutes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil conscriptions and lay monasteries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferred by modern thinkers, as they thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bread of man indeed made all his life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And washing seven times in the "People's Baths"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were sovereign for a people's leprosy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still leaving out the essential prophet's word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That comes in power. On which, we thunder down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We prophets, poets, Virtue's in the word!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maker burnt the darkness up with His,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inaugurate the use of vocal life;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, plant a poet's word even, deep enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any man's breast, looking presently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For offshoots, you have done more for the man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than if you dressed him in a broad-cloth coat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And warmed his Sunday pottage at your fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Romney leaves me . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God! what face is that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Romney, O Marian!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the quays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pulling thoughts to pieces leisurely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I caught at grasses in a field
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bit them slow between my absent lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shred them with my hands . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What face is that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a face, what a look, what a likeness! Full on mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden blow of it came down, till all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood swam, my eyes dazzled. Then I sprang . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as if a meditative man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were dreaming out a summer afternoon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watching gnats a-prick upon a pond,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When something floats up suddenly, out there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns over . . . a dead face, known once alive . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So old, so new! it would be dreadful now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose the sight and keep the doubt of this:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plunges ha! he has lost it in the splash.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plunged I tore the crowd up, either side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rushed on, forward, forward, after her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her? whom?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman sauntered slow in front,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Munching an apple, she left off amazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I had snatched it: that's not she, at least.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man walked arm-linked with a lady veiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both heads dropped closer than the need of talk:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They started; he forgot her with his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she, herself, and clung to him as if
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My look were fatal. Such a stream of folk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all with cares and business of their own!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran the whole quay down against their eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Marian; nowhere Marian. Almost, now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could call Marian, Marian, with the shriek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of desperate creatures calling for the Dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is she, was she? was she anywhere?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood still, breathless, gazing, straining out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every uncertain distance, till at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentleman abstracted as myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came full against me, then resolved the clash
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In voluble excuses, obviously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some learned member of the Institute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his way there, walking, for his health,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While meditating on the last "Discourse;"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinching the empty air 'twixt finger and thumb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which the snuff being ousted by that shock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defiled his snow-white waistcoat duly pricked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the button-hole with honourable red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Madame, your pardon," there he swerved from me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A metre, as confounded as he had heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Dumas would be chosen to fill up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next chair vacant, by his "men in us."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since when was genius found respectable?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It passes in its place, indeed, which means
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh floor back, or else the hospital:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolving pistols are ingenious things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But prudent men (Academicians are)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce keep them in the cupboard next the prunes.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, abandoned to a bitter mirth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I loitered to my inn. O world, O world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O jurists, rhymers, dreamers, what you please,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We play a weary game of hide-and-seek!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shape a figure of our fantasy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call nothing something, and run after it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lose it, lose ourselves too in the search,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till clash against us comes a somebody
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who also has lost something and is lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosopher against philanthropist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academician against poet, man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against woman, against the living the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then home, with a bad headache and worse jest!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the water for my heliotropes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yellow roses. Paris has such flowers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But England, also. 'Twas a yellow rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By that south window of the little house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin Romney gathered with his hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all my birthdays for me, save the last;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I shook the tree too rough, too rough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For roses to stay after.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, my maps.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must not linger here from Italy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the last nightingale is tired of song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the last fire-fly dies off in the maize.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul's in haste to leap into the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scorch and seethe itself to a finer mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which here, in this chill north, is apt to stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too stiffly in former moulds.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That face persists,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It floats up, it turns over in my mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As like to Marian as one dead is like
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same alive. In very deed a face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a fancy, though it vanished so;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small fair face between the darks of hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to liken, when I saw her first,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a point of moonlit water down a well:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low brow, the frank space between the eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which always had the brown, pathetic look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a dumb creature who had been beaten once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never since was easy with the world.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ah now I remember perfectly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those eyes, to-day, how overlarge they seemed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if some patient, passionate despair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Like a coal dropped and forgot on tapestry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which slowly burns a widening circle out)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had burnt them larger, larger. And those eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day, I do remember, saw me too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I saw them, with conscious lids astrain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition. Now a fantasy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple shade or image of the brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is merely passive, does not retro-act,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is seen, but sees not.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas a real face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a real Marian.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which being so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ought to write to Romney, "Marian's here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be comforted for Marian."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pen fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hands struck sharp together, as hands do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hold at nothing. Can I write to him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-truth? can I keep my own soul blind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the other half, . . . the worse? What are our souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If still, to run on straight a sober pace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor start at every pebble or dead leaf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must wear blinkers, ignore facts, suppress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six tenths of the road? Confront the truth, my soul!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, as truly as that was Marian's face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arms of that same Marian clasped a thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . Not hid so well beneath the scanty shawl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot name it now for what it was.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child. Small business has a castaway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Marian with that crown of prosperous wives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which the gentlest she grows arrogant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And says "My child." Who finds an emerald ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a beggar's middle finger and requires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More testimony to convict a thief?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child's too costly for so mere a wretch;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She filched it somewhere, and it means, with her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of honour, blessing, merely shame.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot write to Romney, "Here she is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's Marian found! I'll set you on her track:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw her here, in Paris, . . . and her child.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put away your love two years ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, plainly, not to starve. You suffered then;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, now that you've forgot her utterly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any last year's annual, in whose place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've planted a thick-flowering evergreen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I choose, being kind, to write and tell you this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make you wholly easy she's not dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only . . . damned."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop there: I go too fast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm cruel like the rest, in haste to take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stir in the arras for a rat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set my barking, biting thoughts upon't.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child! what then? Suppose a neighbour's sick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And asked her, "Marian, carry out my child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Spring air," I punish her for that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or say, the child should hold her round the neck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For good child-reasons, that he liked it so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would not leave her she had winning ways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brand her therefore that she took the child?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not write to Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now he's happy, and she may indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be guilty, and the knowledge of her fault
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would draggle his smooth time. But I, whose days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not so fine they cannot bear the rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who moreover having seen her face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must see it again, . . . will see it, by my hopes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one day seeing heaven too. The police
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall track her, hound her, ferret their own soil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll dig this Paris to its catacombs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But certainly we'll find her, have her out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And save her, if she will or will not child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or no child, if a child, then one to save!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long weeks passed on without consequence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As easy find a footstep on the sand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning after spring-tide, as the trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Marian's feet between the incessant surfs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this live flood. She may have moved this way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so the star-fish does, and crosses out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dent of her small shoe. The foiled police
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renounced me. "Could they find a girl and child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other signalment but girl and child?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No data shown but noticeable eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hair in masses, low upon the brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it were an iron crown and pressed?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends heighten, and suppose they specify:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, girls with hair and eyes are everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Paris; they had turned me up in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Marian Erle indeed, but certainly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathildes, Justines, Victoires, . . . or, if I sought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English, Betsis, Saras, by the score.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might as well go out into the fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find a speckled bean, that's somehow specked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And somewhere in the pod." They left me so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I leave Marian? have I dreamed a dream?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank God I have found her! I must say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank God," for finding her, although 'tis true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find the world more sad and wicked for't.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll write about her, presently.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hand's a-tremble, as I had just caught up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart to write with, in the place of it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least you'd take these letters to be writ
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sea, in storm! wait now. . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple chance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did all. I could not sleep last night, and, tired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of turning on my pillow and harder thoughts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went out at early morning, when the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is delicate with some last starry touch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wander through the Market-place of Flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The prettiest haunt in Paris), and make sure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At worst that there were roses in the world.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wandering, musing, with the artist's eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That keeps the shade-side of the thing it loves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-absent, whole-observing, while the crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of young, vivacious, and black-braided heads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dipped, quick as finches in a blossomed tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the nosegays, cheapening this and that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a cheerful twitter of rapid speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart leapt in me, startled by a voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That slowly, faintly, with long breaths that marked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interval between the wish and word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquired in stranger's French, "Would that be much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That branch of flowering mountain-gorse?" "So much?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much for me, then!" turning the face round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So close upon me that I felt the sigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned with.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marian, Marian!" face to face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marian! I find you. Shall I let you go?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I held her two slight wrists with both my hands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah Marian, Marian, can I let you go?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fluttered from me like a cyclamen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As white, which taken in a sudden wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beats on against the palisade. "Let pass,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said at last. "I will not," I replied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I lost my sister Marian many days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sought her ever in my walks and prayers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, now I find her . . . do we throw away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bread we worked and prayed for, crumble it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drop it, . . . to do even so by thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom still I've hungered after more than bread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sister Marian? can I hurt thee, dear?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why distrust me? Never tremble so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come with me rather where we'll talk and live,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none shall vex us. I've a home for you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And me and no one else." . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A home for you and me and no one else
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill suits one of us: I prefer to such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roof of grass on which a flower might spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less costly to me than the cheapest here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I could not, at this hour, afford
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A like home even. That you offer yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank you. You are good as heaven itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As good as one I knew before. . . . Farewell."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I loosed her hands: "In his name, no farewell!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(She stood as if I held her.) "For his sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his sake, Romney's! by the good he meant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, always! by the love he pressed for once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the grief, reproach, abandonment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took in change" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He? Romney! who grieved him?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had the heart for't? what reproach touched him?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be merciful, speak quickly."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore come,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered with authority. "I think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We dare to speak such things and name such names
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the open squares of Paris!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, but in a gentle humbled way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As one who had forgot herself in grief)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned round and followed closely where I went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I led her by a narrow plank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across devouring waters, step by step;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so in silence we walked on a mile.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she stopped: her face was white as wax.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We go much farther?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are ill," I asked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or tired?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked the whiter for her smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's one at home," she said, "has need of me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time, and I must not let him wait."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not even," I asked, "to hear of Romney Leigh?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not even," she said, "to hear of Mister Leigh."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In that case," I resumed, "I go with you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we can talk the same thing there as here.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None waits for me: I have my day to spend."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lips moved in a spasm without a sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then she spoke. "It shall be as you please;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And better so 'tis shorter seen than told:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though you will not find me worth your pains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, even, may be worth some pains to know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one as good as you are."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she led
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way, and I, as by a narrow plank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across devouring waters, followed her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping by her footsteps, breathing by her breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And holding her with eyes that would not slip;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, without a word, we walked a mile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, another mile, without a word.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the peopled streets being all dismissed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House-rows and groups all scattered like a flock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market-gardens thickened, and the long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White walls beyond, like spiders' outside threads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched, feeling blindly toward the country-fields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through half-built habitations and half-dug
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundations, intervals of trenchant chalk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bit betwixt the grassy uneven turfs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where goats (vine-tendrils trailing from their mouths)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood perched on edges of the cellarage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which should be, staring as about to leap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find their coming Bacchus. All the place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed less a cultivation than a waste.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men work here, only, scarce begin to live:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All's sad, the country struggling with the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an untamed hawk upon a strong man's fist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That beats its wings and tries to get away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cannot choose be satisfied so soon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hop through court-yards with its right foot tied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vintage plains and pastoral hills in sight.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stopped beside a house too high and slim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stand there by itself, but waiting till
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five others, two on this side, three on that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should grow up from the sullen second floor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pause at now, to build it to a row.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper windows partly were unglazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime, a meagre, unripe house: a line
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rigid poplars elbowed it behind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, just in front, beyond the lime and bricks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wronged the grass between it and the road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great acacia with its slender trunk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And overpoise of multitudinous leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In which a hundred fields might spill their dew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And intense verdure, yet find room enough)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood reconciling all the place with green.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed up the stair upon her step.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hurried upward, shot across a face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman's, on the landing, "How now, now!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is no one to have holidays but you?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said an hour, and stayed three hours, I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Julie waiting for your betters here?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why if he had waked he might have waked, for me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just murmuring an excusing word, she passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shut the rest out with the chamber-door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself shut in beside her.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas a room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce larger than a grave, and near as bare;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two stools, a pallet-bed; I saw the room:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mouse could find no sort of shelter in't,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less a greater secret; curtainless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window fixed you with its torturing eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defying you to take a step apart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If peradventure you would hide a thing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the whole room, I and Marian there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone? She threw her bonnet off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, sighing as 'twere sighing the last time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approached the bed, and drew a shawl away:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could not peel a fruit you fear to bruise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More calmly and more carefully than so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor would you find within, a rosier flushed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pomegranate


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he lay upon his back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yearling creature, warm and moist with life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the bottom of his dimples, to the ends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lovely tumbled curls about his face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For since he had been covered over-much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep him from the light-glare, both his cheeks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were hot and scarlet as the first live rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shepherd's heart-blood ebbed away into
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faster for his love. And love was here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As instant; in the pretty baby-mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut close as if for dreaming that it sucked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little naked feet, drawn up the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nestled birdlings; everything so soft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tender, to the tiny holdfast hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, closing on a finger into sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had kept the mould of't.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we stood there dumb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For oh, that it should take such innocence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove just guilt, I thought, and stood there dumb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light upon his eyelids pricked them wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, staring out at us with all their blue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As half perplexed between the angelhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had been away to visit in his sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our most mortal presence, gradually
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his mother's face, accepting it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In change for heaven itself with such a smile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As might have well been learnt there, never moved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But smiled on, in a drowse of ecstasy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So happy (half with her and half with heaven)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not have the trouble to be stirred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But smiled and lay there. Like a rose, I said?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As red and still indeed as any rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blows in all the silence of its leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content in blowing to fulfil its life.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaned above him (drinking him as wine)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that extremity of love, 'twill pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For agony or rapture, seeing that love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes the whole of nature, rounding it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To love . . . no more, since more can never be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than just love. Self-forgot, cast out of self,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drowning in the transport of the sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her whole pale passionate face, mouth, forehead, eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One gaze, she stood: then, slowly as he smiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled too, slowly, smiling unaware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drawing from his countenance to hers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fainter red, as if she watched a flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood in it a-glow. "How beautiful,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said she.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered, trying to be cold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Must sin have compensations, was my thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it were a holy thing like grief?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is a woman to be fooled aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From putting vice down, with that woman's toy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A baby?) "Ay! the child is well enough,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered. "If his mother's palms are clean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They need be glad of course in clasping such;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if not, I would rather lay my hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were I she, on God's brazen altar-bars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red-hot with burning sacrificial lambs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than touch the sacred curls of such a child."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She plunged her fingers in his clustering locks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who would not be afraid of fire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then with indrawn steady utterance said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My lamb, my lamb! although, through such as thou,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most unclean got courage and approach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To God, once, now they cannot, even with men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find grace enough for pity and gentle words."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Marian," I made answer, grave and sad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The priest who stole a lamb to offer him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was still a thief. And if a woman steals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Through God's own barrier-hedges of true love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which fence out license in securing love)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child like this, that smiles so in her face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is no mother, but a kidnapper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he's a dismal orphan, not a son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom all her kisses cannot feed so full
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not miss hereafter a pure home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live in, a pure heart to lean against,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pure good mother's name and memory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hope by, when the world grows thick and bad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he feels out for virtue."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," she smiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bitter patience, "the child takes his chance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much worse off in being fatherless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I was, fathered. He will say, belike,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother was the saddest creature born;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll say his mother lived so contrary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To joy, that even the kindest, seeing her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew sometimes almost cruel: he'll not say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flew contrarious in the face of God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bat-wings of her vices. Stole my child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My flower of earth, my only flower on earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sweet, my beauty!" . . . Up she snatched the child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, breaking on him in a storm of tears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew out her long sobs from their shivering roots,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he took it for a game, and stretched
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feet and flapped his eager arms like wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crowed and gurgled through his infant laugh:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mine, mine," she said. "I have as sure a right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any glad proud mother in the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sets her darling down to cut his teeth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon her church-ring. If she talks of law,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talk of law! I claim my mother-dues
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By law, the law which now is paramount,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law, by which the poor and weak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are trodden underfoot by vicious men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loathed for ever after by the good.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let pass! I did not filch, I found the child."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You found him, Marian?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay, I found him where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found my curse, in the gutter, with my shame!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have you, any of you, to say to that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who all are happy, and sit safe and high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never spoke before to arraign my right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To grief itself? What, what, . . . being beaten down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By hoofs of maddened oxen into a ditch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-dead, whole mangled, when a girl at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathes, sees . . . and finds there, bedded in her flesh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the extremity of the shock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some coin of price! . . . and when a good man comes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That's God! the best men are not quite as good)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And says 'I dropped the coin there: take it you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep it, it shall pay you for the loss,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You all put up your finger 'See the thief!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Observe what precious thing she has come to filch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'How bad those girls are!' Oh, my flower, my pet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare forget I have you in my arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fly off to be angry with the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fright you, hurt you with my tempers, till
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You double up your lip? Why, that indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is bad: a naughty mother!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mistake,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I interrupted; "if I loved you not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should not, Marian, certainly be here."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas," she said, "you are so very good;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I wish indeed you had never come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make me sob until I vex the child.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not wholesome for these pleasure-plats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be so early watered by our brine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, who knows? he may not like me now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, perhaps, as ere he saw me fret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One's ugly fretting! he has eyes the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As angels, but he cannot see as deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I've kept for ever in his sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sort of smile to please him, as you place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green thing from the garden in a cup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make believe it grows there. Look, my sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cowslip-ball! we've done with that cross face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here's the face come back you used to like.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ah! he laughs! he likes me. Ah, Miss Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're great and pure; but were you purer still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if you had walked, we'll say, no otherwhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than up and down the New Jerusalem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held your trailing lutestring up yourself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From brushing the twelve stones, for fear of some
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small speck as little as a needle-prick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White stitched on white, the child would keep to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would choose his poor lost Marian, like me best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, though you stretched your arms, cry back and cling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we do when God says it's time to die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bids us go up higher. Leave us, then;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We two are happy. Does he push me off?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's satisfied with me, as I with him."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So soft to one, so hard to others! Nay,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cried, more angry that she melted me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We make henceforth a cushion of our faults
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sit and practise easy virtues on?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought a child was given to sanctify
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman, set her in the sight of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear-eyed heavens, a chosen minister
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do their business and lead spirits up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficult blue heights. A woman lives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not bettered, quickened toward the truth and good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through being a mother? . . . then she's none! although
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She damps her baby's cheeks by kissing them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we kill roses."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill! O Christ," she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned her wild sad face from side to side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With most despairing wonder in it, "What,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have you in your souls against me then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of you? am I wicked, do you think?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God knows me, trusts me with the child; but you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think me really wicked?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complaisant,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered softly, "to a wrong you've done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of certain profits, which is wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the first wrong, Marian. When you left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure place and the noble heart, to take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of a seducer" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whom? whose hand?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the hand of" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springing up erect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lifting up the child at full arm's length,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to bear him like an oriflamme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconquerable to armies of reproach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By him," she said, "my child's head and its curls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By these blue eyes no woman born could dare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A perjury on, I make my mother's oath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That if I left that Heart, to lighten it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of mine was still, except for grief!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cleaner maid than I was took a step
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a sadder end, no matron-mother now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks backward to her early maidenhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through chaster pulses. I speak steadily;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I lie so, . . . if, being fouled in will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And paltered with in soul by devil's lust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dared to bid this angel take my part, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would God sit quiet, let us think, in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor strike me dumb with thunder? Yet I speak:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clears me therefore. What, 'seduced' 's your word!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do wolves seduce a wandering fawn in France?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do eagles, who have pinched a lamb with claws,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seduce it into carrion? So with me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not ever, as you say, seduced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But simply, murdered."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There she paused, and sighed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a sigh as drops from agony
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To exhaustion, sighing while she let the babe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slide down upon her bosom from her arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all her face's light fell after him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a torch quenched in falling. Down she sank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sat upon the bedside with the child.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I, convicted, broken utterly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With woman's passion clung about her waist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissed her hair and eyes, "I have been wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Marian" . . . (weeping in a tender rage) . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet holy Marian! And now, Marian, now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll use your oath although my lips are hard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the child, my Marian, by the child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear his mother shall be innocent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my conscience, as in the open Book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Him who reads for judgment. Innocent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sister! let the night be ne'er so dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon is surely somewhere in the sky;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So surely is your whiteness to be found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all dark facts. But pardon, pardon me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smile a little, Marian, for the child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not for me, my sister."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor lip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just motioned for the smile and let it go:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, with scarce a stirring of the mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a statue spoke that could not breathe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But spoke on calm between its marble lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm glad, I'm very glad you clear me so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be sorry that you set me down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With harlots, or with even a better name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which misbecomes his mother. For the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not on a level with your love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ever was, you know, but now am worse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that world of yours has dealt with me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the hard sea bites and chews a stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And changes the first form of it. I've marked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shore of pebbles bitten to one shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the various life of madrepores;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, that little stone, called Marian Erle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picked up and dropped by you and another friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was ground and tortured by the incessant sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bruised from what she was, changed! death's a change,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she, I said, was murdered; Marian's dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can you do with people when they are dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if you are pious, sing a hymn and go;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if you are tender, heave a sigh and go;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But go by all means, and permit the grass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep its green feud up 'twixt them and you?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then leave me, let me rest. I'm dead, I say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if, to save the child from death as well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother in me has survived the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, that's God's miracle you must not tax,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not less dead for that: I'm nothing more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just a mother. Only for the child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm warm, and cold, and hungry, and afraid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smell the flowers a little and see the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speak still, and am silent, just for him!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray you therefore to mistake me not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And treat me haply as I were alive;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For though you ran a pin into my soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would not hurt nor trouble me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's proof, dear lady, in the market-place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, you promised me to say a word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About . . . a friend, who once, long years ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took God's place toward me, when He leans and loves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And does not thunder, . . . whom at last I left,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all of us leave God. You thought perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seemed to care for hearing of that friend?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, judge me! we have sat here half an hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talked together of the child and me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I not asked as much as 'What's the thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You had to tell me of the friend . . . the friend?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's sad, I think you said, he's sick perhaps?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis nought to Marian if he's sad or sick.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another would have crawled beside your foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prayed your words out. Why, a beast, a dog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A starved cat, if he had fed it once with milk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would show less hardness. But I'm dead, you see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that explains it."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor, poor thing, she spoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook her head, as white and calm as frost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On days too cold for raining any more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still with such a face, so much alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not choose but take it on my arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stroke the placid patience of its cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then told my story out, of Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, having lost her, sought her, missed her still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, broken-hearted for himself and her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had drawn the curtains of the world awhile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he had done with morning. There I stopped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when she gasped, and pressed me with her eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now . . . how is it with him? tell me now,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt the shame of compensated grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chose my words with scruple slowly stepped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the slippery stones set here and there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the sliding water. "Certainly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As evening empties morning into night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another morning takes the evening up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With healthful, providential interchange;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, though he thought still of her "


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, she knew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She understood: she had supposed indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, as one stops a hole upon a flute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which a new note comes and shapes the tune,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding her would bring a worthier in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, long ere this, that Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved so" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Loved," I started, "loved her so!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now tell me" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will tell you," she replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, since we're taking oaths, you'll promise first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he in England, he, shall never learn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what a dreadful trap his creature here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round whose unworthy neck he had meant to tie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honourable ribbon of his name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell unaware and came to butchery:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, I know him, as he takes to heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grief of every stranger, he's not like
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To banish mine as far as I should choose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In wishing him most happy. Now he leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think of me, perverse, who went my way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unkind, and left him, but if once he knew . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, then, the sharp nail of my cruel wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would fasten me for ever in his sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some poor curious bird, through each spread wing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nailed high up over a fierce hunter's fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spoil the dinner of all tenderer folk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come in by chance. Nay, since your Marian's dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not hang her up, but dig a hole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bury her in silence! ring no bells."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered gaily, though my whole voice wept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We'll ring the joy-bells, not the funeral-bells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we have her back, dead or alive."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never answered that, but shook her head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then low and calm, as one who, safe in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall tell a story of his lower life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmoved by shame or anger, so she spoke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me she had loved upon her knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As others pray, more perfectly absorbed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the act and inspiration. She felt his
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For just his uses, not her own at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His stool, to sit on or put up his foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cup, to fill with wine or vinegar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whichever drink might please him at the chance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that should please her always: let him write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name upon her . . . it seemed natural;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was most precious, standing on his shelf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wait until he chose to lift his hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, well, I saw her then, and must have seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How bright her life went floating on her love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like wicks the housewives send afloat on oil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which feeds them to a flame that lasts the night.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do good seemed so much his business,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, having done it, she was fain to think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must fill up his capacity for joy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first she never mooted with herself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he was happy, since he made her so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if he loved her, being so much beloved.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thinks of asking if the sun is light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observing that it lightens? who's so bold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To question God of His felicity?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still less. And thus she took for granted first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What first of all she should have put to proof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sinned against him so, but only so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What could you hope," she said, "of such as she?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take a kid you like, and turn it out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some fair garden: though the creature's fond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gentle, it will leap upon the beds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And break your tulips, bite your tender trees;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonder would be if such innocence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoiled less: a garden is no place for kids."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, by degrees, when he who had chosen her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought in his courteous and benignant friends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spend their goodness on her, which she took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So very gladly, as a part of his,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By slow degrees it broke on her slow sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she too in that Eden of delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was out of place, and, like the silly kid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still did most mischief where she meant most love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought enough to make a woman mad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(No beast in this but she may well go mad),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That saying "I am thine to love and use"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May blow the plague in her protesting breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the very man for whom she claims to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, clinging round his neck, she pulls him down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drowns him, and that, lavishing her soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hales perdition on him. "So, being mad,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Marian . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah who stirred such thoughts,you ask?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose fault it was, that she should have such thoughts?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None's fault, none's fault. The light comes, and we see:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it were not truly for our eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be nothing seen, for all the light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so with Marian: if she saw at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense was in her, Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had spoken all in vain else."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O my heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O prophet in my heart," I cried aloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then Lady Waldemar spoke!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did she speak,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mused Marian softly, "or did she only sign?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or did she put a word into her face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look, and so impress you with the word?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or leave it in the foldings of her gown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like rosemary smells a movement will shake out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When no one's conscious? who shall say, or guess?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing alone was certain from the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gracious lady paid a visit first,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, Marian, saw things different, felt distrust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that sheltering roof of circumstance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hopes were building into with clay nests:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her heart was restless, pacing up and down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fluttering, like dumb creatures before storms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not knowing wherefore she was ill at ease."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And still the lady came," said Marian Erle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Much oftener than he knew it, Mister Leigh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bade me never tell him she had come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She liked to love me better than he knew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So very kind was Lady Waldemar:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every time she brought with her more light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every light made sorrow clearer . . . Well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, well! we cannot give her blame for that;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould be the same thing if an angel came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose right should prove our wrong. And every time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady came, she looked more beautiful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spoke more like a flute among green trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last, as one, whose heart being sad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing lovely music, suddenly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolves in weeping, I brake out in tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before her, asked her counsel, 'Had I erred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In being too happy? would she set me straight?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For she, being wise and good and born above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The flats I had never climbed from, could perceive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If such as I might grow upon the hills;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And whether such poor herb sufficed to grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For Romney Leigh to break his fast upon't,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Or would he pine on such, or haply starve?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wrapped me in her generous arms at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me dream a moment how it feels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a real mother, like some girls:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I looked, her face was younger . . . ay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth's too bright not to be a little hard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beauty keeps itself still uppermost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's true! Though Lady Waldemar was kind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hurt me, hurt, as if the morning-sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should smite us on the eyelids when we sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wake us up with headache. Ay, and soon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was light enough to make my heart ache too:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me truths I asked for, 'twas my fault,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That Romney could not love me, if he would,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As men call loving: there are bloods that flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Together like some rivers and not mix,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Through contraries of nature. He indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Was set to wed me, to espouse my class,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Act out a rash opinion, and, once wed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So just a man and gentle could not choose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But make my life as smooth as marriage-ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Bespeak me mildly, keep me a cheerful house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With servants, brooches, all the flowers I liked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And pretty dresses, silk the whole year round' . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which I stopped her, 'This for me. And now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For him.' She hesitated, truth grew hard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She owned ''Twas plain a man like Romney Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Required a wife more level to himself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If day by day he had to bend his height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To pick up sympathies, opinions, thoughts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And interchange the common talk of life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Which helps a man to live as well as talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'His days were heavily taxed. Who buys a staff
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To fit the hand, that reaches but the knee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He'd feel it bitter to be forced to miss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The perfect joy of married suited pairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Who, bursting through the separating hedge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Of personal dues with that sweet eglantine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Of equal love, keep saying, "So we think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"It strikes us, that's our fancy."' When I asked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If earnest will, devoted love, employed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In youth like mine, would fail to raise me up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As two strong arms will always raise a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a fruit hung overhead, she sighed and sighed . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That could not be,' she feared. 'You take a pink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You dig about its roots and water it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And so improve it to a garden-pink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But will not change it to a heliotrope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The kind remains. And then, the harder truth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This Romney Leigh, so rash to leap a pale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So bold for conscience, quick for martyrdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would suffer steadily and never flinch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But suffer surely and keenly, when his class
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Turned shoulder on him for a shameful match,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And set him up as nine-pin in their talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To bowl him down with jestings.' There, she paused.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I used the pause in doubting that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wronged him after all in what we feared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Suppose such things could never touch him more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In his high conscience (if the things should be)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Than, when the queen sits in an upper room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The horses in the street can spatter her!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment, hope came, but the lady closed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That door and nicked the lock and shut it out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observing wisely that 'the tender heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Which made him over-soft to a lower class,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Would scarcely fail to make him sensitive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To a higher, how they thought and what they felt.'


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas, alas!" said Marian, rocking slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pretty baby who was near asleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyelids creeping over the blue balls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She made it clear, too clear I saw the whole!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet who knows if I had seen my way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight out of it by looking, though 'twas clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the generous lady, 'ware of this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had set her own house all a-fire for me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To light me forwards? Leaning on my face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her heavy agate eyes which crushed my will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me tenderly (as when men come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a bedside to tell people they must die),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'She knew of knowledge, ay, of knowledge knew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That Romney Leigh had loved her formerly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And she loved him, she might say, now the chance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Was past, but that, of course, he never guessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For something came between them, something thin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As a cobweb, catching every fly of doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To hold it buzzing at the window-pane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And help to dim the daylight. Ah, man's pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Or woman's which is greatest? most averse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To brushing cobwebs? Well, but she and he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Remained fast friends; it seemed not more than so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because he had bound his hands and could not stir.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An honourable man, if somewhat rash;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And she, not even for Romney, would she spill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A blot . . . as little even as a tear . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Upon his marriage-contract, not to gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A better joy for two than came by that:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For, though I stood between her heart and heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'She loved me wholly.'"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I laugh or curse?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I sat there silent, hearing all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, hearing double, Marian's tale, at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Romney's marriage vow, "I'll keep to thee,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means that woman-serpent. Is it time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For church now?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lady Waldemar spoke more,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued Marian, "but, as when a soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will pass out through the sweetness of a song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond it, voyaging the uphill road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so mine wandered from the things I heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those I suffered. It was afterward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shaped the resolution to the act.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many hours we talked. What need to talk?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate was clear and close; it touched my eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still the generous lady tried to keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case afloat, and would not let it go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And argued, struggled upon Marian's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was not Romney's! though she little knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ugly monster would take up the end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What griping death within the drowning death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was ready to complete my sum of death."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought, Perhaps he's sliding now the ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon that woman's finger . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went on:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lady, failing to prevail her way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgathered my torn wishes from the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pieced them with her strong benevolence;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as I thought I could breathe freer air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from England, going without pause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without farewell, just breaking with a jerk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blossomed offshoot from my thorny life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She promised kindly to provide the means,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With instant passage to the colonies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full protection, 'would commit me straight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To one who once had been her waiting-maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And had the customs of the world, intent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On changing England for Australia
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Herself, to carry out her fortune so.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which I thanked the Lady Waldemar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men upon their death-beds thank last friends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lay the pillow straight: it is not much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet 'tis all of which they are capable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lying smoothly in a bed to die.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, 'twas fixed; and so, from day to day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman named came in to visit me."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then the girl stopped speaking, sat erect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stared at me as if I had been a ghost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Perhaps I looked as white as any ghost),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With large-eyed horror. "Does God make," she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All sorts of creatures really, do you think?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is it that the Devil slavers them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So excellently, that we come to doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who's stronger, He who makes, or he who mars?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never liked the woman's face or voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ways: it made me blush to look at her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made me tremble if she touched my hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when she spoke a fondling word I shrank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if one hated me who had power to hurt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, every time she came, my veins ran cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As somebody were walking on my grave.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last I spoke to Lady Waldemar:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Could such an one be good to trust?' I asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat the lady stroked my cheek and laughed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her silver-laugh (one must be born to laugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put such music in it), 'Foolish girl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Your scattered wits are gathering wool beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The sheep-walk reaches! leave the thing to me.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore, half in trust, and half in scorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I had heart still for another fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a safe despair, I left the thing.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rest is short. I was obedient:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote my letter which delivered him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Marian to his own prosperities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And followed that bad guide. The lady? hush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never blame the lady. Ladies who
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit high, however willing to look down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will scarce see lower than their dainty feet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lady Waldemar saw less than I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what a Devil's daughter I went forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the swine's road, down the precipice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a curl of hell-foam caught and choked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No shriek of soul in anguish could pierce through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fetch some help. They say there's help in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all such cries. But if one cries from hell . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then? the heavens are deaf upon that side.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A woman . . . hear me, let me make it plain, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman . . . not a monster . . . both her breasts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made right to suckle babes . . . she took me off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman also, young and ignorant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heavy with my grief, my two poor eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near washed away with weeping, till the trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blessed unaccustomed trees and fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran either side the train like stranger dogs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unworthy of any notice, took me off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So dull, so blind, so only half-alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not seeing by what road, nor by what ship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor toward what place, nor to what end of all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men carry a corpse thus, past the doorway, past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden-gate, the children's playground, up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green lane, then they leave it in the pit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleep and find corruption, cheek to cheek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him who stinks since Friday.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But suppose;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go down with one's soul into the grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go down half-dead, half-alive, I say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wake up with corruption, . . . cheek to cheek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him who stinks since Friday! There it is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's the horror of't, Miss Leigh.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You feel?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You understand? no, do not look at me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But understand. The blank, blind, weary way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which led, where'er it led, away at least;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shifted ship, to Sydney or to France,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still bound, wherever else, to another land;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swooning sickness on the dismal sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign shore, the shameful house, the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeble blood, the heavy-headed grief, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to bring their damnable drugged cup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet they brought it. Hell's so prodigal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of devil's gifts, hunts liberally in packs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will kill no poor small creature of the wilds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fifty red wide throats must smoke at it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his at me . . . when waking up at last . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told you that I waked up in the grave.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough so! it is plain enough so. True,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wretches cannot tell out all our wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without offence to decent happy folk.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we must scrupulously hint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With half-words, delicate reserves, the thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which no one scrupled we should feel in full.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let pass the rest, then; only leave my oath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon this sleeping child, man's violence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not man's seduction, made me what I am,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lost as . . . I told him I should be lost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When mothers fail us, can we help ourselves?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's fatal! And you call it being lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That down came next day's noon and caught me there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-gibbering and half-raving on the floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wondering what had happened up in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That suns should dare to shine when God Himself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was certainly abolished.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was mad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many weeks, I know not, many weeks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they let me go when I was mad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feared my eyes and loosed me, as boys might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mad dog which they had tortured. Up and down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went, by road and village, over tracts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of open foreign country, large and strange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossed everywhere by long thin poplar-lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like fingers of some ghastly skeleton Hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sunlight and through moonlight evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushed out from hell itself to pluck me back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And resolute to get me, slow and sure;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While every roadside Christ upon his cross
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung reddening through his gory wounds at me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook his nails in anger, and came down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To follow a mile after, wading up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low vines and green wheat, crying 'Take the girl!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'She's none of mine from henceforth.' Then I knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(But this is somewhat dimmer than the rest)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charitable peasants gave me bread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave to sleep in straw: and twice they tied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At parting, Mary's image round my neck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How heavy it seemed! as heavy as a stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman has been strangled with less weight:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I threw it in a ditch to keep it clean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ease my breath a little, when none looked;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not need such safeguards: brutal men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopped short, Miss Leigh, in insult, when they had seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My face, I must have had an awful look.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I lived: the weeks passed on, I lived.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas living my old tramp-life o'er again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, this time, in a dream, and hunted round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By some prodigious Dream-fear at my back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ended yet: my brain cleared presently;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there I sat, one evening, by the road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, Marian Erle, myself, alone, undone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facing a sunset low upon the flats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it were the finish of all time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great red stone upon my sepulchre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which angels were too weak to roll away.

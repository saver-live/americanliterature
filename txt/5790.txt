<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RICHARD HENRY DANA

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old churchyard of his native town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the ancestral tomb beside the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We laid him in the sleep that comes to all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him to his rest and his renown.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow was falling, as if Heaven dropped down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White flowers of Paradise to strew his pall;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead around him seemed to wake, and call
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name, as worthy of so white a crown.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the moon is shining on the scene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the broad sheet of snow is written o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With shadows cruciform of leafless trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As once the winding-sheet of Saladin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With chapters of the Koran; but, ah! more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious and triumphant signs are these.

               In a year, in a year, when the grapes are ripe,
               I shall stay no more away -
               Then if you still are true, my love,
               It will be our wedding day.

               In a year, in a year, when my time is past -
               Then I'll live in your love for aye.
               Then if you still are true, my love,
               It will be our wedding day.

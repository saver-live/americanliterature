<p>As a silver, delicate strand<br> Is woven in my dark tresses –<br> Only you, silent nightingale,<br> Can understand this torment.<br> <br> Your sensitive ear hears distance,<br> In the willow's thin branches,<br> Ruffled, you gaze – without breathing –<br> If a strange song sounds.<br> <br> But a moment ago, a moment,<br> The poplars suddenly stilled,<br> And your ineffable joy,<br> Rang out, your poisonous song.<br></p>

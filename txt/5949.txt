<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that somewhere and somehow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You all have heard of Hagenau,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet, quaint, and ancient town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the green Alsatian hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place of valleys, streams, and mills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Barbarossa's castle, brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rust of centuries, still looks down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the broad, drowsy land below,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On shadowy forests filled with game,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the blue river winding slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through meadows, where the hedges grow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That give this little town its name.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened in the good old times,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet the Master-singers filled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noisy workshop and the guild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With various melodies and rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That here in Hagenau there dwelt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cobbler,--one who loved debate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, arguing from a postulate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would say what others only felt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of forecast and of thrift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of a shrewd and careful mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world's business, but inclined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat to let the next world drift.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hans Sachs with vast delight he read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Regenbogen's rhymes of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For their poetic fame had spread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to the town of Hagenau;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some Quick Melody of the Plough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Double Harmony of the Dove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was always running in his head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept, moreover, at his side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among his leathers and his tools,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reynard the Fox, the Ship of Fools,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Eulenspiegel, open wide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these he was much edified:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought them wiser than the Schools.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His good wife, full of godly fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liked not these worldly themes to hear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Psalter was her book of songs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only music to her ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that which to the Church belongs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the loud choir on Sunday chanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the two angels carved in wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That by the windy organ stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew on their trumpets loud and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the echoes, far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibbered as if the church were haunted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside his door, one afternoon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This humble votary of the muse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat in the narrow strip of shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a projecting cornice made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mending the Burgomaster's shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And singing a familiar tune:--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our ingress into the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was naked and bare;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our progress through the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is trouble and care;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our egress from the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will be nobody knows where;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we do well here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall do well there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I could tell you no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I preach a whole year!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus sang the cobbler at his work;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with his gestures marked the time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing together with a jerk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his waxed thread the stitch and rhyme.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile his quiet little dame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was leaning o'er the window-sill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eager, excited, but mouse-still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing impatiently to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the great throng of folk might be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That onward in procession came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the unfrequented street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With horns that blew, and drums that beat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And banners flying, and the flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tapers, and, at times, the sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of nuns; and as they sang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly all the church-bells rang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a gay coach, above the crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There sat a monk in ample hood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who with his right hand held aloft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A red and ponderous cross of wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which at times he meekly bowed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front three horsemen rode, and oft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With voice and air importunate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boisterous herald cried aloud:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The grace of God is at your gate!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So onward to the church they passed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cobbler slowly tuned his last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, wagging his sagacious head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto his kneeling housewife said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis the monk Tetzel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cawings of that reverend bird.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't let him cheat you of your gold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulgence is not bought and sold."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church of Hagenau, that night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was full of people, full of light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An odor of incense filled the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest intoned, the organ groaned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its inarticulate despair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candles on the altar blazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full in front of it upraised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red cross stood against the glare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below, upon the altar-rail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulgences were set to sale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like ballads at a country fair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy strong-box, iron-bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carved with many a quaint device,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received, with a melodious sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coin that purchased Paradise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from the pulpit overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tetzel the monk, with fiery glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thundered upon the crowd below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good people all, draw near!" he said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Purchase these letters, signed and sealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By which all sins, though unrevealed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unrepented, are forgiven!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count but the gain, count not the loss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your gold and silver are but dross,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet they pave the way to heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear your mothers and your sires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry from their purgatorial fires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will ye not their ransom pay?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O senseless people! when the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven is open, will ye wait?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will ye not enter in to-day?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow it will be too late;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be gone upon my way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make haste! bring money while ye may!'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women shuddered, and turned pale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allured by hope or driven by fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a sob and many a tear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All crowded to the altar-rail.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pieces of silver and of gold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the tinkling strong-box fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like pebbles dropped into a well;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon the ballads were all sold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cobbler's wife among the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slipped into the capacious chest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden florin; then withdrew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding the paper in her breast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And homeward through the darkness went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comforted, quieted, content;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not walk, she rather flew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dove that settles to her nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some appalling bird of prey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scared her has been driven away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days went by, the monk was gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer passed, the winter came;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though seasons changed, yet still the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily round of life went on;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily round of household care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow life of toil and prayer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in her heart the cobbler's dame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had now a treasure beyond price,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secret joy without a name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certainty of Paradise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust unto dust!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the winter wore away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her body in the churchyard lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her patient soul was with the Just!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After her death, among the things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That even the poor preserve with care,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some little trinkets and cheap rings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A locket with her mother's hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wedding gown, the faded flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore upon her wedding day,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these memories of past hours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That so much of the heart reveal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully kept and put away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Letter of Indulgence lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folded, with signature and seal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Priest, aggrieved and pained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited and wondered that no word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mass or requiem he heard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As by the Holy Church ordained;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the Magistrate complained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That as this woman had been dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week or more, and no mass said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was rank heresy, or at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contempt of Church; thus said the Priest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight the cobbler was arraigned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came, confiding in his cause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rather doubtful of the laws.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Justice from his elbow-chair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave him a look that seemed to say:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou standest before a Magistrate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore do not prevaricate!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then asked him in a business way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly but cold: "Is thy wife dead?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cobbler meekly bowed his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is," came struggling from his throat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce audibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Justice wrote
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words down in a book, and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued, as he raised his pen:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is; and hath a mass been said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the salvation of her soul?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, speak the truth! confess the whole!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cobbler without pause replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of mass or prayer there was no need;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For at the moment when she died
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her soul was with the glorified!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from his pocket with all speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew the priestly title-deed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prayed the Justice he would read.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Justice read, amused, amazed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he read his mirth increased;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times his shaggy brows he raised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now wondering at the cobbler gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now archly at the angry Priest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From all excesses, sins, and crimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast committed in past times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee I absolve!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And furthermore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purified from all earthly taints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the communion of the Saints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the sacraments restore!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stains of weakness, and all trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shame and censure I efface;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remit the pains thou shouldst endure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make thee innocent and pure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that in dying, unto thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of heaven shall open be!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though long thou livest, yet this grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the moment of thy death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unchangeable continueth!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said he to the Priest: "I find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document is duly signed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother John Tetzel, his own hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all tribunals in the land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In evidence it may be used;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore acquitted is the accused."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the cobbler turned: "My friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray tell me, didst thou ever read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reynard the Fox?"--"O yes, indeed!"--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget the end."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was the end?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ashamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to remember Reynard's fate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not read the book of late;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was he not hanged?" the Poet said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student gravely shook his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And answered: "You exaggerate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tournament proclaimed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Reynard fought with Isegrim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wolf, and having vanquished him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose to high honor in the State,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Keeper of the Seals was named!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this the gay Sicilian laughed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fight fire with fire, and craft with craft;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful cunning seems to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of your tale," said he.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mine had a better, and the Jew's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had none at all, that I could see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His aim was only to amuse."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile from out its ebon case
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His violin the Minstrel drew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having tuned its strings anew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now held it close in his embrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poising in his outstretched hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow, like a magician's wand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, and said, with beaming face:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night my story was too long;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day I give you but a song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old tradition of the North;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, to put you in the mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will a little while prelude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from this instrument draw forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something by way of overture."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He played; at first the tones were pure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tender as a summer night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full moon climbing to her height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sob and ripple of the seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flapping of an idle sail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then by sudden and sharp degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multiplied, wild harmonies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freshened and burst into a gale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tempest howling through the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crash as of some shipwrecked bark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud and melancholy wail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the prelude to the tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told by the Minstrel; and at times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused amid its varying rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at each pause again broke in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of his violin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tones of sweetness or of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Movements of trouble or of calm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating their own atmosphere;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sitting in a church we hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the verses of the psalm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organ playing soft and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thundering on the startled ear.

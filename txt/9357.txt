&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I came over Windy Gap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They threw a halfpenny into my cap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am running to Paradise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that I need do is to wish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And somebody puts his hand in the dish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To throw me a bit of salted fish:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there the king is but as the beggar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother Mourteen is worn out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With skelping his big brawling lout,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am running to Paradise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poor life do what he can,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though he keep a dog and a gun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serving maid and a serving man:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there the king is but as the beggar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor men have grown to be rich men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rich men grown to be poor again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am running to Paradise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a darling witÂ’s grown dull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tossed a bare heel when at school,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it has filled an old sock full:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there the king is but as the beggar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is old and still at play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I must hurry upon my way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am running to Paradise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet never have I lit on a friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take my fancy like the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nobody can buy or bind:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there the king is but as the beggar.

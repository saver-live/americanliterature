<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Craoibhin Aoibhin, look into our case.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are high and airy hundreds say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That if we hold that flight theyll leave the place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While those same hundreds mock another day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we have made our art of common things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So bitterly, youd dream they longed to look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All their lives through into some drift of wings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youve dandled them and fed them from the book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know them to the bone; impart to us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well keep the secret, a new trick to please.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a bridle for this Proteus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That turns and changes like his draughty seas?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is there none, most popular of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they mock us that we mock again?
</pre>

<p>One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.</p><p>"What!" cried the Ants in surprise, "haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer?"</p><p>"I didn't have time to store up any food," whined the Grasshopper; "I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone."</p><p>The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust.</p><p>"Making music, were you?" they cried. "Very well; now dance!" And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work.</p><p class="center"><i>There's a time for work and a time for play.</i></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general eard the firin on the flank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An e sent a mounted man to bring im back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silly, pushin persons name an rank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ood dared to answer Brother Boers attack:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there might ave been a serious engagement,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An e might ave wasted alf a dozen men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So e ordered im to stop is operations round the kopjes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An e told im off before the Staff at ten!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it all goes into the laundry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it never comes out in the wash,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ow were sugared about by the old men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Eavy sterned amateur old men!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That amper an inder an scold men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear o Stellenbosh!*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General ad produced a great effect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General ad the country cleared, almost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General ad no reason to expect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Boers ad us bloomin well on toast!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we might ave crossed the drift before the twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead o sitting down an takin root;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we was not allowed, so the Boojers scooped the crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the last survivin bandolier an boot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General saw the farmouse in is rear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its stoep so nicely shaded from the sun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sez e, Ill pitch my tabernacle ere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An e kept us muckin round till e ad done.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For e might ave caught the confluent pneumonia
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From sleepin in his gaiters in the dew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So e took a book an dozed while the other columns closed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And De Wets commando out an trickled through!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General saw the mountain-range ahead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their elios showin saucy on the eight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So e eld us to the level ground instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An telegraphed the Boojers would nt fight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For e might ave gone an sprayed em with a pompom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or e might ave slung a squadron out to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bute was nt takin chances in them igh an ostile kranzes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was markin time to earn a K.C.B

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General got is decorations thick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The men that backed is lies could not complain),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Staff ad D.S.O.s till we was sick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An the soldier, ad the work to do again!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For e might ave known the District was an otbed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of andin over, upside-down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a man oo ad to fight alf a year to put it right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the General went an slandered im in town!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An it all went into the laundry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it never came out in the wash.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were sugared about by the old men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Panicky, perishin old men)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That amper an inder an scold men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear o Stellenbosh!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many bards gild the lapses of time!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few of them have ever been the food
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my delighted fancy, I could brood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over their beauties, earthly, or sublime:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And often, when I sit me down to rhyme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These will in throngs before my mind intrude:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no confusion, no disturbance rude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they occasion; 'tis a pleasing chime.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the unnumbered sounds that evening store;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The songs of birds the whispering of the leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of waters the great bell that heaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With solemn sound, and thousand others more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That distance of recognizance bereaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes pleasing music, and not wild uproar.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days said Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo! how all things fade and perish!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the memory of the old men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass away the great traditions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements of the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventures of the hunters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wisdom of the Medas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the craft of the Wabenos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the marvellous dreams and visions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Jossakeeds, the Prophets!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great men die and are forgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise men speak; their words of wisdom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perish in the ears that hear them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not reach the generations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, as yet unborn, are waiting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great, mysterious darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the speechless days that shall be!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the grave-posts of our fathers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are no signs, no figures painted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are in those graves we know not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only know they are our fathers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what kith they are and kindred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what old, ancestral Totem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be it Eagle, Bear, or Beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They descended, this we know not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only know they are our fathers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Face to face we speak together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot speak when absent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot send our voices from us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the friends that dwell afar off;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot send a secret message,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bearer learns our secret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May pervert it, may betray it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May reveal it unto others."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus said Hiawatha, walking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the solitary forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondering, musing in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the welfare of his people.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his pouch he took his colors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took his paints of different colors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the smooth bark of a birch-tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted many shapes and figures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful and mystic figures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each figure had a meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each some word or thought suggested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito the Mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, the Master of Life, was painted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an egg, with points projecting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the four winds of the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere is the Great Spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the meaning of this symbol.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitche Manito the Mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the dreadful Spirit of Evil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a serpent was depicted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Kenabeek, the great serpent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very crafty, very cunning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the creeping Spirit of Evil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the meaning of this symbol.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life and Death he drew as circles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life was white, but Death was darkened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun and moon and stars he painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man and beast, and fish and reptile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forests, mountains, lakes, and rivers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the earth he drew a straight line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sky a bow above it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White the space between for daytime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with little stars for night-time;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left a point for sunrise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right a point for sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top a point for noontide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for rain and cloudy weather
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waving lines descending from it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Footprints pointing towards a wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were a sign of invitation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were a sign of guests assembling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloody hands with palms uplifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were a symbol of destruction,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were a hostile sign and symbol.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these things did Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show unto his wondering people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And interpreted their meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said: "Behold, your grave-posts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have no mark, no sign, nor symbol,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and paint them all with figures;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one with its household symbol,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its own ancestral Totem;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that those who follow after
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May distinguish them and know them."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they painted on the grave-posts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the graves yet unforgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each his own ancestral Totem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each the symbol of his household;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures of the Bear and Reindeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Turtle, Crane, and Beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each inverted as a token
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the owner was departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the chief who bore the symbol
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay beneath in dust and ashes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wabenos, the Magicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Medicine-men, the Medas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted upon bark and deer-skin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures for the songs they chanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each song a separate symbol,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures mystical and awful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures strange and brightly colored;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each figure had its meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each some magic song suggested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Spirit, the Creator,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashing light through all the heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Serpent, the Kenabeek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his bloody crest erected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creeping, looking into heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky the sun, that listens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon eclipsed and dying;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl and eagle, crane and hen-hawk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cormorant, bird of magic;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headless men, that walk the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodies lying pierced with arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloody hands of death uplifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flags on graves, and great war-captains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasping both the earth and heaven!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as these the shapes they painted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the birch-bark and the deer-skin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of war and songs of hunting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of medicine and of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were written in these figures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each figure had its meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each its separate song recorded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor forgotten was the Love-Song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most subtle of all medicines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most potent spell of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous more than war or hunting!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Love-Song was recorded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbol and interpretation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a human figure standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted in the brightest scarlet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is the lover, the musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the meaning is, "My painting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes me powerful over others."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the figure seated, singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing on a drum of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the interpretation, "Listen!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is my voice you hear, my singing!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the same red figure seated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shelter of a wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the meaning of the symbol,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will come and sit beside you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mystery of my passion!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two figures, man and woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing hand in hand together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their hands so clasped together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they seemed in one united,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the words thus represented
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are, "I see your heart within you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your cheeks are red with blushes!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next the maiden on an island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the centre of an island;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the song this shape suggested
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was, "Though you were at a distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were upon some far-off island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the spell I cast upon you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the magic power of passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could straightway draw you to me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the figure of the maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeping, and the lover near her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispering to her in her slumbers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Though you were far from me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of Sleep and Silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the voice of love would reach you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the last of all the figures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a heart within a circle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn within a magic circle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the image had this meaning:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naked lies your heart before me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your naked heart I whisper!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was that Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his wisdom, taught the people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the mysteries of painting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the art of Picture-Writing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the smooth bark of the birch-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the white skin of the reindeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grave-posts of the village.

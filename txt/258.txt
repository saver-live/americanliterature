<p>Now farewell, capital,<br> Farewell, my spring.<br> Karelia's earth,<br> Already, yearns for me.<br> <br> Fields and gardens,<br> Tranquil and green,<br> The waters there still deep,<br> The heavens pale.<br> <br> The marsh water-nymph,<br> Mistress of those spaces<br> Gazes, sadly sighing,<br> At the bell-tower's cross.<br> <br> And the oriole, my friend<br> Of innocent days,<br> Flew north yesterday,<br> And cries, among the branches,<br> <br> That it's shameful to stay<br> Till May in the city,<br> Stifle in the theatres,<br> Be bored on the islands.<br> <br> Though the oriole can't know,<br> The nymph can't understand,<br> How sweet it is for me,<br> Kissing him!<br> <br> And yet, this evening,<br> In the day's quiet decline,<br> Ishall leave. God's country,<br> Take me in!</p>

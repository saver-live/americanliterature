Mother, the hen is cackling;
What is she trying to say?
She says, “Cluck! cluck! I humbly beg
To tell you all I’ve laid an egg
For Little Boy to-day!”
Oh! oh! is it so?
Truly now, I did not know!
But in return what shall I give?
“Be kind, be kind, to all that live!”

Mother, the cow is lowing;
What is she trying to say?
“Milk and cream and butter and cheese,
Good people, I have brought you these
For Little Boy to-day.”
Oh! oh! is it so?
Truly now, I did not know!
But in return what shall I give?
“Be kind, be kind, to all that live.”

Mother, the sheep is bleating;
What is she trying to say?
She says “I’ll give my fleecy wool
To make warm clothes for play and school
For Little Boy to-day.”
Oh! oh! is it so?
Truly now, I did not know!
But in return what shall I give?
“Be kind, be kind, to all that live.”

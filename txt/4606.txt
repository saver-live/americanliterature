<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you no Bananas, simple townsmen all?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, but we have them certainly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We buy them off the barrows, with the vegetable-marrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cabbage of our own country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(From the costers of our own country.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are not Bananas, simple townsmen all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Plantains from Canaryward maybe!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the true are red and gold, and they fill no steamers hold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But flourish in a rare country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That men go far to see.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their stiff fronds point the nooning down, simple townsmen all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rear against the breezes off the sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or duck and loom again, through the curtains of the rain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the loaded hills let free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Bellying twixt the uplands and the sea.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little birds inhabit there, simple townsmen all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewelled things no bigger than a bee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the opal butterflies plane and settle, flare and rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the low-arched greenery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That is malachite and jade of the sea.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red earth works and whispers there, simple towns men all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day and night in rank fecundity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Blossom and the Snake lie open and awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it was by Eden Tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(When the First Moon silvered through the Tree) . . .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you must go to business, simple townsmen all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By bus and train and tram and tube must flee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your Pharpars and Abanas do not include Bananas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And Jordan is a distant stream to drink of, simple townsmen),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which leaves the more for me!

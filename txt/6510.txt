<p>"I'm writing a poem on Peace," said Reginald, emerging from a sweeping operation through a tin of mixed biscuits, in whose depths a macaroon or two might yet be lurking.</p><p> "Something of the kind seems to have been attempted already," said the Other.</p><p> "Oh, I know; but I may never have the chance again. Besides, I've got a new fountain pen. I don't pretend to have gone on any very original lines; in writing about Peace the thing is to say what everybody else is saying, only to say it better. It begins with the usual ornithological emotion -</p><p> 'When the widgeon westward winging Heard the folk Vereeniginging, Heard the shouting and the singing'" -</p><p> "Vereeniginging is good, but why widgeon?"</p><p> "Why not? Anything that winged westward would naturally begin with a W."</p><p> "Need it wing westward?"</p><p> "The bird must go somewhere. You wouldn't have it hang around and look foolish. Then I've brought in something about the heedless hartebeest galloping over the deserted veldt."</p><p> "Of course you know it's practically extinct in those regions?"</p><p> "I can't help <i>that</i>, it gallops so nicely. I make it have all sorts of unexpected yearnings -</p><p> 'Mother, may I go and maffick, Tear around and hinder traffic?'</p><p> Of course you'll say there would be no traffic worth bothering about on the bare and sun-scorched veldt, but there's no other word that rhymes with maffick."</p><p> "Seraphic?"</p><p> Reginald considered. "It might do, but I've got a lot about angels later on. You must have angels in a Peace poem; I know dreadfully little about their habits."</p><p> "They can do unexpected things, like the hartebeest."</p><p> "Of course. Then I turn on London, the City of Dreadful Nocturnes, resonant with hymns of joy and thanksgiving -</p><p> 'And the sleeper, eye unlidding, Heard a voice for ever bidding Much farewell to Dolly Gray; Turning weary on his truckle- Bed he heard the honey-suckle Lauded in apiarian lay.'</p><p> Longfellow at his best wrote nothing like that."</p><p> "I agree with you."</p><p> "I wish you wouldn't. I've a sweet temper, but I can't stand being agreed with. And I'm so worried about the aasvogel."</p><p> Reginald stared dismally at the biscuit-tin, which now presented an unattractive array of rejected cracknels.</p><p> "I believe," he murmured, "if I could find a woman with an unsatisfied craving for cracknels, I should marry her."</p><p> "What is the tragedy of the aasvogel?" asked the Other sympathetically.</p><p> "Oh, simply that there's no rhyme for it. I thought about it all the time I was dressing--it's dreadfully bad for one to think whilst one's dressing--and all lunch-time, and I'm still hung up over it. I feel like those unfortunate automobilists who achieve an unenviable motoriety by coming to a hopeless stop with their cars in the most crowded thoroughfares. I'm afraid I shall have to drop the aasvogel, and it did give such lovely local colour to the thing."</p><p> "Still you've got the heedless hartebeest."</p><p> "And quite a decorative bit of moral admonition--when you've worried the meaning out -</p><p> 'Cease, War, thy bubbling madness that the wine shares, And bid thy legions turn their swords to mine shares.'</p><p> Mine shares seems to fit the case better than ploughshares. There's lots more about the blessings of Peace, shall I go on reading it?"</p><p> "If I must make a choice, I think I would rather they went on with the war." </p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes aloft over dangerous places,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children follow where Psyche flies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in the sweat of their upturned faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slash with a net at the empty skies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it goes they fall amid brambles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sting their toes on the nettle-tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till after a thousand scratches and scrambles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wipe their brows, and the hunting stops.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to quiet them comes their father
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stills the riot of pain and grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, Little ones, go and gather
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of my garden a cabbage leaf.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find on it whorls and clots of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dull grey eggs that, properly fed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn by way of the worm to lots of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radiant Psyches raised from the dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven is beautiful, Earth is ugly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-dimensioned preacher saith.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we must not look where the snail and the slug lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Psyches birth . . . . And that is our death!

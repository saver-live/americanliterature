<p>Don't taunt your heart with earthly joys,<br> Don't cleave to your wife and home,<br> Take the bread from your child's mouth,<br> So you can give it to a stranger.<br> <br> Be the humblest servant of the man<br> Who was your bitterest enemy,<br> Call the woodland creatures kin,<br> And don't ask God for anything.<br></p>

<p>PATIENCE and I have traveled hand in hand<br> So many days that I have grown to trace<br> The lines of sad, sweet beauty in her face,<br> And all its veiled depths to understand.<br> <br> Not beautiful is she to eyes profane;<br> Silent and unrevealed her holy charms;<br> But, like a mother's, her serene, strong arms<br> Uphold my footsteps on the path of pain.<br> <br> I long to cry, -- her soft voice whispers, "Nay!"<br> I seek to fly, but she restrains my feet;<br> In wisdom stern, yet in compassion sweet,<br> She guides my helpless wanderings, day by day.<br> <br> O my Beloved, life's golden visions fade,<br> And one by one life's phantom joys depart;<br> They leave a sudden darkness in the heart,<br> And patience fills their empty place instead.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I compare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have lost with what I have gained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have missed with what attained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little room do I find for pride.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many days have been idly spent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How like an arrow the good intent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has fallen short or been turned aside.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But who shall dare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To measure loss and gain in this wise?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defeat may be victory in disguise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest ebb is the turn of the tide.

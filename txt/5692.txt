<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon Danz has come home again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From cruising about with his buccaneers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has singed the beard of the King of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carried away the Dean of Jaen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sold him in Algiers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his house by the Maese, with its roof of tiles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weathercocks flying aloft in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are silver tankards of antique styles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunder of convent and castle, and piles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of carpets rich and rare.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his tulip-garden there by the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overlooking the sluggish stream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his Moorish cap and dressing-gown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old sea-captain, hale and brown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walks in a waking dream.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smile in his gray mustachio lurks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he thinks of the King of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the listed tulips look like Turks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the silent gardener as he works
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is changed to the Dean of Jaen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windmills on the outermost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verge of the landscape in the haze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him are towers on the Spanish coast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With whiskered sentinels at their post,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this is the river Maese.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the winter rains begin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sits and smokes by the blazing brands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And old seafaring men come in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goat-bearded, gray, and with double chin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rings upon their hands.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sit there in the shadow and shine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the flickering fire of the winter night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures in color and design
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like those by Rembrandt of the Rhine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half darkness and half light.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they talk of ventures lost or won,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their talk is ever and ever the same,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they drink the red wine of Tarragon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cellars of some Spanish Don,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or convent set on flame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restless at times with heavy strides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paces his parlor to and fro;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a ship that at anchor rides,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swings with the rising and falling tides,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tugs at her anchor-tow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices mysterious far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound of the wind and sound of the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are calling and whispering in his ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simon Danz! Why stayest thou here?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come forth and follow me!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he thinks he shall take to the sea again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one more cruise with his buccaneers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To singe the beard of the King of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And capture another Dean of Jaen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sell him in Algiers.

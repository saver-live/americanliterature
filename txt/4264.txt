<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pleasant tale is like a little copse:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honied lines do freshly interlace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the reader in so sweet a place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that he here and there full hearted stops;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oftentimes he feels the dewy drops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come cool and suddenly against his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the wandering melody may trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which way the tender-legged linnet hops.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! What a power hath white simplicity!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What mighty power has this gentle story!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, that for ever feel athirst for glory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could at this moment be content to lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekly upon the grass, as those whose sobbings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were heard of none beside the mournful robbins.

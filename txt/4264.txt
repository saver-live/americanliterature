<pre>1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One morn before me were three figures seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I With bowed necks, and joined hands, side-faced;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one behind the other stepp'd serene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In placid sandals, and in white robes graced;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pass'd, like figures on a marble urn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shifted round to see the other side;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came again; as when the urn once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is shifted round, the first seen shades return;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were strange to me, as may betide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.

2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it, Shadows! that I knew ye not?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How came ye muffled in so hush a masque?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it a silent deep-disguised plot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To steal away, and leave without a task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blissful cloud of summer-indolence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benumb'd my eyes; my pulse grew less and less;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain had no sting, and pleasure's wreath no flower:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhaunted quite of all but nothingness?

3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time came they by; alas! wherefore?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sleep had been embroider'd with dim dreams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morn was clouded, but no shower fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' in her lids hung the sweet tears of May;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open casement press'd a new-leav'd vine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let in the budding warmth and throstle's lay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Shadows! 'twas a time to bid farewell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.

4.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time pass'd they by, and, passing, turn'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one the face a moment whiles to me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then faded, and to follow them I burn'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ached for wings, because I knew the three;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first was a fair maid, and Love her name;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second was Ambition, pale of cheek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever watchful with fatigued eye;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last, whom I love more, the more of blame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is heap'd upon her, maiden most unmeek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew to be my demon Poesy.

5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O folly! What is Love! and where is it?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for that poor Ambition it springs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a man's little heart's short fever-fit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Poesy! no, she has not a joy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least for me, so sweet as drowsy noons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And evenings steep'd in honied indolence;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, for an age so shelter'd from annoy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may never know how change the moons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hear the voice of busy common-sense!

6.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I would not be dieted with praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fade sofdy from my eyes, and be once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell! I yet have visions for the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the day faint visions there is store;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the clouds, and never more return!

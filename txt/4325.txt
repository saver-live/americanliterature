<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great spirits now on earth are sojourning;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He of the cloud, the cataract, the lake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who on Helvellyn's summit, wide awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catches his freshness from Archangel's wing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He of the rose, the violet, the spring, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social smile, the chain for Freedom's sake:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! whose stedfastness would never take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meaner sound than RaphaelÂ’s whispering.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other spirits there are standing apart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the forehead of the age to come; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, these will give the world another heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other pulses. Hear ye not the hum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mighty workings?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen awhile ye nations, and be dumb.

Through the starry hollow
     Of the summer night
     I would follow, follow
     Hesperus the bright,
     To seek beyond the western wave
     His garden of delight.

     Hesperus the fairest
     Of all gods that are,
     Peace and dreams thou bearest
     In thy shadowy car,
     And often in my evening walks
     I've blessed thee from afar.

     Stars without number,
     Dust the noon of night,
     Thou the early slumber
     And the still delight
     Of the gentle twilit hours
     Rulest in thy right.

     When the pale skies shiver,
     Seeing night is done,
     Past the ocean-river,
     Lightly thou dost run,
     To look for pleasant, sleepy lands,
     That never fear the sun.

     Where, beyond the waters
     Of the outer sea,
     Thy triple crown of daughters
     That guards the golden tree
     Sing out across the lonely tide
     A welcome home to thee.

     And while the old, old dragon
     For joy lifts up his head,
     They bring thee forth a flagon
     Of nectar foaming red,
     And underneath the drowsy trees
     Of poppies strew thy bed.

     Ah! that I could follow
     In thy footsteps bright,
     Through the starry hollow
     Of the summer night,
     Sloping down the western ways
     To find my heart's delight!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My future will not copy fair my past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On any leaf but Heaven's. Be fully done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supernal Will! I would not fain be one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, satisfying thirst and breaking fast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the fulness of the heart, at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saith no grace after meat. My wine hath run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed out of my cup, and there is none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gather up the bread of my repast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered and trampled! Yet I find some good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In earth's green herbs, and streams that bubble up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear from the darkling ground, content until
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit with angels before better food.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Christ! when thy new vintage fills my cup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hand shall shake no more, nor that wine spill.
</pre>

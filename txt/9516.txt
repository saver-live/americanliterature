<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gave but will not give again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until enough of Paudeens pence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Biddys halfpennies have lain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be some sort of evidence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before youll put your guineas down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That things it were a pride to give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are what the blind and ignorant town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagines best to make it thrive.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What cared Duke Ercole, that bid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mummers to the market place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What th onion-sellers thought or did
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that his Plautus set the pace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Italian comedies?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Guidobaldo, when he made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That grammar school of courtesies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where wit and beauty learned their trade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Urbinos windy hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had sent no runners to and fro
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he might learn the shepherds will.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they drove out Cosimo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indifferent how the rancour ran,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave the hours they had set free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Michelozzos latest plan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the San Marco Library,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence turbulent Italy should draw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delight in Art whose end is peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In logic and in natural law
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sucking at the dugs of Greece.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your open hand but shows our loss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he knew better how to live.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Paudeens play at pitch and toss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up in the suns eye and give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the exultant heart calls good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That some new day may breed the best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you gave, not what they would
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the right twigs for an eagles nest!

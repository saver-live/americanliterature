<p>Always so many pleas from a lover!<br> None when they fall out of love.<br> I'm so glad it plunges, the river,<br> Beneath colourless ice above.<br> <br> And I'm to stand – God help me! –<br> On the surface, fissured, gleaming,<br> With my letters, for posterity<br> To judge, in your safe keeping,<br> <br> So that clearly, and distinctly,<br> They can see you, brave and wise,<br> In your glorious biography,<br> No gaps revealed to the eye?<br> <br> To drink of Earth's too sweet,<br> And Love's nets are too fine.<br> But may my name be seen<br> In the students' books in time,<br> <br> And, let them smile, secretly,<br> On reading my sad story…<br> If I can't have love, if I can't have peace,<br> Grant me a bitter glory.<br></p>

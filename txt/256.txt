<p>My voice is weak but not my will,<br> It's better even without love.<br> High skies and mountain winds,<br> And my thoughts now innocent.<br> <br> Insomnia, my nurse, is elsewhere.<br> I'm not brooding by cold ashes.<br> And the curved hand on the tower clock,<br> Is no longer a deadly arrow.<br> <br> How the past loses power over the heart!<br> Freedom is near. Everything's simple,<br> See how the sunlight falls across<br> The wet ivy this spring.<br></p>

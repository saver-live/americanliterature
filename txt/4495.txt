<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend, thou beholdest the lightning? Who has the charge of it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To decree which rock-ridge shall receive, shall be chosen for targe of it?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which crown among palms shall go down, by the thunderbolt broken;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the floods drown the sere wadis where no bud is token?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First for my eyes, above all, he made show of his treasure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First in his ear, before all, I made sure of my measure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were good, what acclaim! None other so moved me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were faulty, what shame? While he mocked me he loved me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend, thou hast seen in Ridaar, the low moon descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One silent, swart, swift-striding camel, oceanward wending?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browbound and jawbound the rider, his shadow in front of him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceaselessly eating the distances? That was the wont of him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the cliff-walled defiles, the ambush prepared for him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the wave-crested dunes, a single sword bared for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether cold danger fore-weighed, or quick peril that took him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, out of comfort or aid, no breath of it shook him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether he feasted or fasted, sweated or shivered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no proof of the matter, no sign was delivered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever this dust or that heat, or those fools that he laboured with,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forgot and forbore no observance towards any he neighboured with.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend, thou hast known at Ridaar, when the Council was bidden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One face among faces that leaped to the light and were hidden?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One voice among night-wasting voices of boasting and shouting?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that face and that voice abide with thee? His beyond doubting!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never again in Ridaar, my watch-fire burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he might see from afar, shall I wait his returning;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the roar of his beast as she knelt and he leaped to unlade her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-handedly tossing me jewels. He was no trader!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gems and wrought gold, never sold, brought for me to behold them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tales of far magic unrolled, to me only he told them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light, easy laugh of dismissal twixt story and story,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a man brushes sand from his hand, or the great dismiss glory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never again in Ridaar! My ways are made black to me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether I sing or am silent, he shall not come back to me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no measure for trial, nor treasure for bringing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allah divides the Companions. (Yet he said, yet he said:, Cease not from singing.)

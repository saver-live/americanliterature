<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With most prevailing tinsel: who unpen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their baaing vanities, to browse away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comfortable green and juicy hay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From human pastures; or, O torturing fact!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our gold and ripe-ear'd hopes. With not one tinge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sanctuary splendour, not a sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Able to face an owl's, they still are dight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crowns, and turbans. With unladen breasts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save of blown self-applause, they proudly mount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their spirit's perch, their being's high account,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the fierce intoxicating tones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of trumpets, shoutings, and belabour'd drums,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sudden cannon. Ah! how all this hums,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like thunder clouds that spake to Babylon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set those old Chaldeans to their tasks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are then regalities all gilded masks?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there are throned seats unscalable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by a patient wing, a constant spell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by ethereal things that, unconfin'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can make a ladder of the eternal wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poise about in cloudy thunder-tents
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch the abysm-birth of elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, 'bove the withering of old-lipp'd Fate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand Powers keep religious state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In water, fiery realm, and airy bourne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, silent as a consecrated urn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold sphery sessions for a season due.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet few of these far majesties, ah, few!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have bared their operations to this globe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our piece of heaven whose benevolence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes hand with our own Ceres; every sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt Nothing and Creation, I here swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eterne Apollo! that thy Sister fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is of all these the gentlier-mightiest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thy gold breath is misting in the west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unobserved steals unto her throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there she sits most meek and most alone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she had not pomp subservient;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if thine eye, high Poet! was not bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards her with the Muses in thine heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the ministring stars kept not apart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for silver-footed messages.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Moon! the oldest shades 'mong oldest trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel palpitations when thou lookest in:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while they feel thine airy fellowship.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou dost bless every where, with silver lip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innumerable mountains rise, and rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet thy benediction passeth not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One obscure hiding-place, one little spot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where pleasure may be sent: the nested wren
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within its pearly house. The mighty deeps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monstrous sea is thine the myriad sea!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tellus feels his forehead's cumbrous load.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia! where art thou now? What far abode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of green or silvery bower doth enshrine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such utmost beauty? Alas, thou dost pine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one as sorrowful: thy cheek is pale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one whose cheek is pale: thou dost bewail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! surely that light peeps from Vesper's eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what a thing is love! 'Tis She, but lo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How chang'd, how full of ache, how gone in woe!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dies at the thinnest cloud; her loveliness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is wan on Neptune's blue: yet there's a stress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love-spangles, just off yon cape of trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dancing upon the waves, as if to please
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curly foam with amorous influence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, not so idle: for down-glancing thence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fathoms eddies, and runs wild about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erwhelming water-courses; scaring out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright'ning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their savage eyes with unaccustomed lightning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will the splendor be content to reach?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O love! how potent hast thou been to teach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange journeyings! Wherever beauty dwells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gulf or aerie, mountains or deep dells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou pointest out the way, and straight 'tis won.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid his toil thou gav'st Leander breath;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou leddest Orpheus through the gleams of death;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou madest Pluto bear thin element;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, O winged Chieftain! thou hast sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find Endymion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On gold sand impearl'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lily shells, and pebbles milky white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against his pallid face: he felt the charm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To breathlessness, and suddenly a warm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so he kept, until the rosy veils
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were lifted from the water's breast, and fann'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into sweet air; and sober'd morning came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekly through billows: when like taper-flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left sudden by a dallying breath of air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose in silence, and once more 'gan fare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along his fated way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far had he roam'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With nothing save the hollow vast, that foam'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, around, and at his feet; save things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More dead than Morpheus' imaginings:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudders that for a hundred years had lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With long-forgotten story, and wherein
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reveller had ever dipp'd a chin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those of Saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ponderous stone, developing the mood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ancient Nox; then skeletons of man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nameless monster. A cold leaden awe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These secrets struck into him; and unless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dian had chaced away that heaviness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might have died: but now, with cheered feel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the labyrinth in his soul of love.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is there in thee, Moon! that thou shouldst move
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart so potently? When yet a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I oft have dried my tears when thou hast smil'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou seem'dst my sister: hand in hand we went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From eve to morn across the firmament.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No apples would I gather from the tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till thou hadst cool'd their cheeks deliciously:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No tumbling water ever spake romance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when my eyes with thine thereon could dance:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No woods were green enough, no bower divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sowing time ne'er would I dibble take,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in the summer tide of blossoming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one but thee hath heard me blithly sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mesh my dewy flowers all the night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No melody was like a passing spright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it went not to solemnize thy reign.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as I grew in years, still didst thou blend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast the mountain-top the sage's pen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet's harp the voice of friends the sun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast the river thou wast glory won;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast my clarion's blast thou wast my steed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My goblet full of wine my topmost deed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O what a wild and harmonized tune
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My spirit struck from all the beautiful!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On some bright essence could I lean, and lull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself to immortality: I prest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My strange love came Felicity's abyss!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been an under-passion to this hour.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I begin to feel thine orby power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is coming fresh upon me: O be kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep back thine influence, and do not blind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sovereign vision. Dearest love, forgive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I can think away from thee and live!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pardon me, airy planet, that I prize
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought beyond thine argent luxuries!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far beyond!" At this a surpris'd start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frosted the springing verdure of his heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as he lifted up his eyes to swear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How his own goddess was past all things fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw far in the concave green of the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man sitting calm and peacefully.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a weeded rock this old man sat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his white hair was awful, and a mat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, ample as the largest winding-sheet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ambitious magic: every ocean-form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was woven in with black distinctness; storm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And calm, and whispering, and hideous roar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were emblem'd in the woof; with every shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To its huge self; and the minutest fish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would pass the very hardest gazer's wish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show his little eye's anatomy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was pictur'd the regality
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside this old man lay a pearly wand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his lap a book, the which he conn'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So stedfastly, that the new denizen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had time to keep him in amazed ken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man rais'd his hoary head and saw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilder'd stranger seeming not to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His features were so lifeless. Suddenly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went arching up, and like two magic ploughs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till round his wither'd lips had gone a smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had not from mid-life to utmost age
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to the trees. He rose: he grasp'd his stole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo into oblivion, he said:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In peace upon my watery pillow: now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Jove! I shall be young again, be young!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc'd and stung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their melodies, and see their long hair glisten;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon upon that giant's arm I'll be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That writhes about the roots of Sicily:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To northern seas I'll in a twinkling sail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mount upon the snortings of a whale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some black cloud; thence down I'll madly sweep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On forked lightning, to the deepest deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where through some sucking pool I will be hurl'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rapture to the other side of the world!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bow full hearted to your old decree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art the man!" Endymion started back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutter'd: "What lonely death am I to die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this cold region? Will he let me freeze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or will he touch me with his searing hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave a black memorial on the sand?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep me as a chosen food to draw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His magian fish through hated fire and flame?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O misery of hell! resistless, tame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the gods through heaven's blue look out!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Tartarus! but some few days agone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her soft arms were entwining me, and on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lips were all my own, and ah, ripe sheaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never may be garner'd. I must stoop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there no hope from thee? This horrid spell

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would melt at thy sweet breath. By Dian's hind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeding from her white fingers, on the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I care not for this old mysterious man!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spake, and walking to that aged form,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look'd high defiance. Lo! his heart 'gan warm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convulsion to a mouth of many years?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penitent shower fell, as down he knelt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About his large dark locks, and faultering spake:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arise, good youth, for sacred Phoebus' sake!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know thine inmost bosom, and I feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very brother's yearning for thee steal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into mine own: for why? thou openest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prison gates that have so long opprest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My weary watching. Though thou know'st it not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art commission'd to this fated spot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For great enfranchisement. O weep no more;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a friend to love, to loves of yore:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been grieving at this joyous hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even now most miserable old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw thee, and my blood no longer cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave mighty pulses: in this tottering case
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew a new heart, which at this moment plays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as we speed towards our joyous task."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, this young soul in age's mask
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went forward with the Carian side by side:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took silently their foot-prints. "My soul stands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now past the midway from mortality,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I can prepare without a sigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a fisher once, upon this main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough billows were my home by night and day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-gulls not more constant; for I had
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No housing from the storm and tempests mad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hollow rocks, and they were palaces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of silent happiness, of slumberous ease:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long years of misery have told me so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, thus it was one thousand years ago.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand years! Is it then possible
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look so plainly through them? to dispel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand years with backward glance sublime?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From off a crystal pool, to see its deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one's own image from the bottom peep?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My long captivity and moanings all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The which I breathe away, and thronging come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I touch'd no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a lonely youth on desert shores.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaining discrepant between sea and sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would let me feel their scales of gold and green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor be my desolation; and, full oft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life away like a vast sponge of fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some friendly monster, pitying my sad state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has dived to its foundations, gulph'd it down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left me tossing safely. But the crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all my life was utmost quietude:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More did I love to lie in cavern rude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping in wait whole days for Neptune's voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There blush'd no summer eve but I would steer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never was a day of summer shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I beheld its birth upon the brine:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I would watch all night to see unfold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven's gates, and Aethon snort his morning gold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide o'er the swelling streams: and constantly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My nets would be spread out, and I at rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor folk of the sea-country I blest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With daily boon of fish most delicate:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew not whence this bounty, and elate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At things which, but for thee, O Latmian!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been my dreary death? Fool! I began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel distemper'd longings: to desire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utmost privilege that ocean's sire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could grant in benediction: to be free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all his kingdom. Long in misery
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasted, ere in one extremest fit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plung'd for life or death. To interknit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might seem a work of pain; so not enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetful utterly of self-intent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried in fear the pinions of my will.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas freedom! and at once I visited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to tell thee of them, for I see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou hast been a witness it must be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the melancholy corners of that mouth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I will in my story straightway pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To more immediate matter. Woe, alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did poor Glaucus ever ever dare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger-youth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lov'd her to the very white of truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she would not conceive it. Timid thing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round every isle, and point, and promontory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From where large Hercules wound up his story
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more, the more I saw her dainty hue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleam delicately through the azure clear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 'twas too fierce agony to bear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in that agony, across my grief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It flash'd, that Circe might find some relief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cruel enchantress! So above the water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rear'd my head, and look'd for Phoebus' daughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aeaea's isle was wondering at the moon:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left me dead-drifting to that fatal power.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over it a sighing voice expire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ceased I caught light footsteps; and anon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Push'd through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dew of her rich speech: "Ah! Art awake?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me hear thee speak, for Cupid's sake!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so oppress'd with joy! Why, I have shed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I find thee living, I will pour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these devoted eyes their silver store,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until exhausted of the latest drop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, that I too may live: but if beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me pluck it for thee." Thus she link'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her charming syllables, till indistinct
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she hover'd over me, and stole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So near, that if no nearer it had been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young man of Latmos! thus particular
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I, that thou may'st plainly see how far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fierce temptation went: and thou may'st not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who could resist? Who in this universe?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fine existence in a golden clime.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took me like a child of suckling time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current of my former life was stemm'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to this arbitrary queen of sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bow'd a tranced vassal: nor would thence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have mov'd, even though Amphion's harp had woo'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me back to Scylla o'er the billows rude.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as Apollo each eve doth devise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new appareling for western skies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So every eve, nay every spendthrift hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shed balmy consciousness within that bower.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was free of haunts umbrageous;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could wander in the mazy forest-house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of squirrels, foxes shy, and antler'd deer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And birds from coverts innermost and drear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me new born delights!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now let me borrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For moments few, a temperament as stern
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Pluto's sceptre, that my words not burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These uttering lips, while I in calm speech tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How specious heaven was changed to real hell.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One morn she left me sleeping: half awake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was gone. Whereat the barbed shafts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of disappointment stuck in me so sore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That out I ran and search'd the forest o'er.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandering about in pine and cedar gloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound of moan, an agony of sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sepulchral from the distance all around.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down a precipitous path, as if impell'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to a dark valley. Groanings swell'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poisonous about my ears, and louder grew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearer I approach'd a flame's gaunt blue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That glar'd before me through a thorny brake.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fire, like the eye of gordian snake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bewitch'd me towards; and I soon was near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sight too fearful for the feel of fear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thicket hid I curs'd the haggard scene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated upon an uptorn forest root;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all around her shapes, wizard and brute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O such deformities! Old Charon's self,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he give up awhile his penny pelf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take a dream 'mong rushes Stygian,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could not be so phantasied. Fierce, wan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tyrannizing was the lady's look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As over them a gnarled staff she shook.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft-times upon the sudden she laugh'd out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from a basket emptied to the rout
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clusters of grapes, the which they raven'd quick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And roar'd for more; with many a hungry lick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About their shaggy jaws. Avenging, slow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon she took a branch of mistletoe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And emptied on't a black dull-gurgling phial:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groan'd one and all, as if some piercing trial
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was sharpening for their pitiable bones.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lifted up the charm: appealing groans
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their poor breasts went sueing to her ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain; remorseless as an infant's bier
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whisk'd against their eyes the sooty oil.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat was heard a noise of painful toil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing gradual to a tempest rage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And puff from the tail's end to stifled throat:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then was appalling silence: then a sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More wildering than all that hoarse affright;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went through the dismal air like one huge Python
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antagonizing Boreas, and so vanish'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet there was not a breath of wind: she banish'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dancing and loud revelry, and went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter than centaurs after rapine bent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing an elephant appear'd and bow'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In human accent: "Potent goddess! chief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pains resistless! make my being brief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or let me from this heavy prison fly:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or give me to the air, or let me die!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sue not for my happy crown again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sue not for my lone, my widow'd wife;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children fair, my lovely girls and boys!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will forget them; I will pass these joys;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask nought so heavenward, so too too high:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or be deliver'd from this cumbrous flesh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And merely given to the cold bleak air.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have mercy, Goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That curst magician's name fell icy numb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my wild conjecturing: truth had come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked and sabre-like against my heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a fury whetting a death-dart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fainted away in that dark lair of night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think, my deliverer, how desolate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My waking must have been! disgust, and hate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And terrors manifold divided me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spoil amongst them. I prepar'd to flee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the dungeon core of that wild wood:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fled three days when lo! before me stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glaring the angry witch. O Dis, even now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clammy dew is beading on my brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! ha! Sir Dainty! there must be a nurse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of rose leaves and thistledown, express,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee: yes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My tenderest squeeze is but a giant's clutch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unheard of yet; and it shall still its cries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon some breast more lily-feminine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no it shall not pine, and pine, and pine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one pretty, trifling thousand years;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then 'twere pity, but fate's gentle shears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young dove of the waters! truly I'll not hurt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hair of thine: see how I weep and sigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That our heart-broken parting is so nigh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And must we part? Ah, yes, it must be so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sob over thee my last adieus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speak a blessing: Mark me! thou hast thews
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immortal, for thou art of heavenly race:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a love is mine, that here I chase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternally away from thee all bloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of youth, and destine thee towards a tomb.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, ere many days be overpast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disabled age shall seize thee; and even then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not go the way of aged men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But live and wither, cripple and still breathe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten hundred years: which gone, I then bequeath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy fragile bones to unknown burial.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu, sweet love, adieu!" As shot stars fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poisoned was my spirit: despair sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A war-song of defiance 'gainst all hell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hand was at my shoulder to compel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sullen steps; another 'fore my eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved on with pointed finger. In this guise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforced, at the last by ocean's foam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found me; by my fresh, my native home.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its tempering coolness, to my life akin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came salutary as I waded in;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with a blind voluptuous rage, I gave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large froth before me, while there yet remain'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain'd.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young lover, I must weep such hellish spite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dry cheek who can tell? While thus my might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proving upon this element, dismay'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a dead thing's face my hand I laid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look'd 'twas Scylla! Cursed, cursed Circe!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O vulture-witch, hast never heard of mercy?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not thy harshest vengeance be content,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou must nip this tender innocent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I lov'd her? Cold, O cold indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were her fair limbs, and like a common weed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-swell took her hair. Dead as she was
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I clung about her waist, nor ceas'd to pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleet as an arrow through unfathom'd brine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until there shone a fabric crystalline,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ribb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headlong I darted; at one eager swirl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all around But wherefore this to thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in few minutes more thyself shalt see?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met palsy half way: soon these limbs became
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaunt, wither'd, sapless, feeble, cramp'd, and lame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without one hope, without one faintest trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mitigation, or redeeming bubble
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of colour'd phantasy; for I fear 'twould trouble
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy brain to loss of reason: and next tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How a restoring chance came down to quell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One half of the witch in me. On a day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting upon a rock above the spray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw grow up from the horizon's brink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gallant vessel: soon she seem'd to sink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from me again, as though her course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been resum'd in spite of hindering force
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So vanish'd: and not long, before arose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark clouds, and muttering of winds morose.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Eolus would stifle his mad spleen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But could not: therefore all the billows green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toss'd up the silver spume against the clouds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tempest came: I saw that vessel's shrouds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In perilous bustle; while upon the deck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O they had all been sav'd but crazed eld
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annull'd my vigorous cravings: and thus quell'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And curb'd, think on't, O Latmian! did I sit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writhing with pity, and a cursing fit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By one and one, to pale oblivion;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was gazing on the surges prone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a scalding tear and many a groan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knelt with pain reached out my hand had grasp'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These treasures touch'd the knuckles they unclasp'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I caught a finger: but the downward weight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erpowered me it sank. Then 'gan abate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comfortable sun. I was athirst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To search the book, and in the warming air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul page after page, till well-nigh won
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read these words, and read again, and tried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes against the heavens, and read again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O what a load of misery and pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Atlas-line bore off! a shine of hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came gold around me, cheering me to cope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thou hast brought their promise to an end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His loath'd existence through ten centuries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then to die alone. Who can devise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total opposition? No one. So
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One million times ocean must ebb and flow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things accomplish'd: If he utterly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scans all the depths of magic, and expounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he explores all forms and substances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight homeward to their symbol-essences;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall not die. Moreover, and in chief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must pursue this task of joy and grief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most piously; all lovers tempest-tost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the savage overwhelming lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall deposit side by side, until
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which done, and all these labours ripened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth, by heavenly power lov'd and led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall stand before him; whom he shall direct
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to consummate all. The youth elect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must do the thing, or both will be destroy'd."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then," cried the young Endymion, overjoy'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are twin brothers in this destiny!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, I intreat thee, what achievement high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is, in this restless world, for me reserv'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had we both perish'd?" "Look!" the sage replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of divers brilliances? 'tis the edifice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where I have enshrined piously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All lovers, whom fell storms have doom'd to die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my bondage." Thus discoursing, on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went till unobscur'd the porches shone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure never since king Neptune held his state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was seen such wonder underneath the stars.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn to some level plain where haughty Mars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has legion'd all his battle; and behold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His even breast: see, many steeled squares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rigid ranks of iron whence who dares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step? Imagine further, line by line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These warrior thousands on the field supine:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in that crystal place, in silent rows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such ranges of white feet, and patient lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ruddy, for here death no blossom nips.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put sleekly on one side with nicest care;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each one's gentle wrists, with reverence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put cross-wise to its heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let us commence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whisper'd the guide, stuttering with joy, even now."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Began to tear his scroll in pieces small,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttering the while some mumblings funeral.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore it into pieces small as snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having done it, took his dark blue cloak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bound it round Endymion: then struck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wand against the empty air times nine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What more there is to do, young man, is thine:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first a little patience; first undo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shouldst thou break it What, is it done so clean?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor mark'd with any sign or charactery
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canst thou read aught? O read for pity's sake!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olympus! we are safe! Now, Carian, break
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wand against yon lyre on the pedestal."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas done: and straight with sudden swell and fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lullaby to silence. "Youth! now strew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These minced leaves on me, and passing through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those files of dead, scatter the same around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou wilt see the issue." 'Mid the sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion from Glaucus stood apart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scatter'd in his face some fragments light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling beneath a coral diadem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press'd its cold hand, and wept and Scylla sigh'd!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion, with quick hand, the charm applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nymph arose: he left them to their joy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And onward went upon his high employ,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showering those powerful fragments on the dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as he pass'd, each lifted up its head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As doth a flower at Apollo's touch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death felt it to his inwards; 'twas too much:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death fell a weeping in his charnel-house.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latmian persever'd along, and thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were re-animated. There arose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noise of harmony, pulses and throes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gladness in the air while many, who
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had died in mutual arms devout and true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang to each other madly; and the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt a high certainty of being blest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gaz'd upon Endymion. Enchantment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew drunken, and would have its head and bent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two deliverers tasted a pure wine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless they eyed each other, and about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair assembly wander'd to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distracted with the richest overflow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of joy that ever pour'd from heaven.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Away!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted the new-born god; "Follow, and pay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our piety to Neptunus supreme!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They led on first, bent to her meek surprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through portal columns of a giant size,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the vaulted, boundless emerald.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down marble steps; pouring as easily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hour-glass sand and fast, as you might see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swallows obeying the south summer's call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or swans upon a gentle waterfall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just within ken, they saw descending thick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another multitude. Whereat more quick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved either host. On a wide sand they met,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of those numbers every eye was wet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what was never heard in all the throes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wind and waters: 'tis past human wit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mighty consummation made, the host
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the rear diminishing away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till a faint dawn surpris'd them. Glaucus cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God Neptune's palaces!" With noise increas'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shoulder'd on towards that brightening east.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every onward step proud domes arose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prospect, diamond gleams, and golden glows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of amber 'gainst their faces levelling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyous, and many as the leaves in spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich opal domes were seen, on high upheld
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By jasper pillars, letting through their shafts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what poor mortals fragment up, as mere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As marble was there lavish, to the vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for common bulk, those olden three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As large, as bright, as colour'd as the bow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Iris, when unfading it doth shew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond a silvery shower, was the arch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through which this Paphian army took its march,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the outer courts of Neptune's state:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which the leaders sped; but not half raught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like callow eagles at the first sunrise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, behold! large Neptune on his throne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his right hand stood winged Love, and on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His left sat smiling Beauty's paragon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far as the mariner on highest mast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can see all round upon the calmed vast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wide was Neptune's hall: and as the blue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth vault the waters, so the waters drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their doming curtains, high, magnificent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aw'd from the throne aloof; and when storm-rent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclos'd the thunder-gloomings in Jove's air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sooth'd as now, flash'd sudden everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death to a human eye: for there did spring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From natural west, and east, and south, and north,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light as of four sunsets, blazing forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gold-green zenith 'bove the Sea-God's head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lucid depth the floor, and far outspread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of feather'd Indian darts about, as through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delicatest air: air verily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the portraiture of clouds and sky:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This palace floor breath-air, but for the amaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of deep-seen wonders motionless, and blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globing a golden sphere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stood in dreams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Triton blew his horn. The palace rang;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nereids danc'd; the Syrens faintly sang;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great Sea-King bow'd his dripping head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Love took wing, and from his pinions shed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all the multitude a nectarous dew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Scylla and her guides to conference;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they reach'd the throned eminence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kist the sea-nymph's cheek, who sat her down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A toying with the doves. Then, "Mighty crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sceptre of this kingdom!" Venus said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy vows were on a time to Nais paid:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold!" Two copious tear-drops instant fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the God's large eyes; he smil'd delectable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over Glaucus held his blessing hands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love? Now this is cruel. Since the hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met thee in earth's bosom, all my power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I put forth to serve thee. What, not yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escap'd from dull mortality's harsh net?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I am skilless quite: an idle tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A humid eye, and steps luxurious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where these are new and strange, are ominous.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, I have seen these signs in one of heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When others were all blind; and were I given
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To utter secrets, haply I might say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pleasant words: but Love will have his day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wait awhile expectant. Pr'ythee soon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the passing of thine honey-moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit my Cytherea: thou wilt find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cupid well-natured, my Adonis kind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pray persuade with thee Ah, I have done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the fair goddess: while Endymion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt to receive those accents halcyon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime a glorious revelry began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Water-Monarch. Nectar ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In courteous fountains to all cups outreach'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plunder'd vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New growth about each shell and pendent lyre;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The which, in disentangling for their fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull'd down fresh foliage and coverture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dainty toying. Cupid, empire-sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flutter'd and laugh'd, and oft-times through the throng
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a delighted way. Then dance, and song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In harmless tendril they each other chain'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strove who should be smother'd deepest in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh crush of leaves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O 'tis a very sin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one so weak to venture his poor verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a place as this. O do not curse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High Muses! let him hurry to the ending.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All suddenly were silent. A soft blending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dulcet instruments came charmingly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a hymn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"KING of the stormy sea!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother of Jove, and co-inheritor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of elements! Eternally before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee the waves awful bow. Fast, stubborn rock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At thy fear'd trident shrinking, doth unlock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its deep foundations, hissing into foam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mountain-rivers lost, in the wide home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy capacious bosom ever flow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou frownest, and old Eolus thy foe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skulks to his cavern, 'mid the gruff complaint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all his rebel tempests. Dark clouds faint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, from thy diadem, a silver gleam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slants over blue dominion. Thy bright team
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulphs in the morning light, and scuds along
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring thee nearer to that golden song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo singeth, while his chariot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waits at the doors of heaven. Thou art not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For scenes like this: an empire stern hast thou;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it hath furrow'd that large front: yet now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As newly come of heaven, dost thou sit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To blend and interknit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subdued majesty with this glad time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O shell-borne King sublime!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lay our hearts before thee evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sing, and we adore!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Breathe softly, flutes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be tender of your strings, ye soothing lutes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor be the trumpet heard! O vain, O vain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not flowers budding in an April rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor breath of sleeping dove, nor river's flow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, nor the Eolian twang of Love's own bow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can mingle music fit for the soft ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of goddess Cytherea!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet deign, white Queen of Beauty, thy fair eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our souls' sacrifice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bright-winged Child!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has another care when thou hast smil'd?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunates on earth, we see at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All death-shadows, and glooms that overcast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our spirits, fann'd away by thy light pinions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sweetest essence! sweetest of all minions!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of warm pulses, and dishevell'd hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And panting bosoms bare!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear unseen light in darkness! eclipser
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of light in light! delicious poisoner!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy venom'd goblet will we quaff until
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fill we fill!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by thy Mother's lips "


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was heard no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For clamour, when the golden palace door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened again, and from without, in shone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new magnificence. On oozy throne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth-moving came Oceanus the old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a latest glimpse at his sheep-fold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he went into his quiet cave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To muse for ever Then a lucid wave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scoop'd from its trembling sisters of mid-sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afloat, and pillowing up the majesty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Doris, and the Egean seer, her spouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on a dolphin, clad in laurel boughs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theban Amphion leaning on his lute:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers went across it All were mute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gaze on Amphitrite, queen of pearls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Thetis pearly too.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The palace whirls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around giddy Endymion; seeing he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there far strayed from mortality.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not bear it shut his eyes in vain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagination gave a dizzier pain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O I shall die! sweet Venus, be my stay!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is my lovely mistress? Well-away!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I die I hear her voice I feel my wing "
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Neptune's feet he sank. A sudden ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Nereids were about him, in kind strife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To usher back his spirit into life:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still he slept. At last they interwove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their cradling arms, and purpos'd to convey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards a crystal bower far away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! while slow carried through the pitying crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his inward senses these words spake aloud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written in star-light on the dark above:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dearest Endymion! my entire love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How have I dwelt in fear of fate: 'tis done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immortal bliss for me too hast thou won.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise then! for the hen-dove shall not hatch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her ready eggs, before I'll kissing snatch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee into endless heaven. Awake! awake!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth at once arose: a placid lake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came quiet to his eyes; and forest green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooler than all the wonders he had seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lull'd with its simple song his fluttering breast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How happy once again in grassy nest!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There where the course is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delight makes all of the one mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riders upon the galloping horses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd that closes in behind:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, too, had good attendance once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearers and hearteners of the work;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, horsemen for companions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the merchant and the clerk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed on the world with timid breath.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing on: sometime, and at some new moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WeÂ’ll learn that sleeping is not death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the whole earth change its tune,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its flesh being wild, and it again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying aloud as the race course is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we find hearteners among men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ride upon horses.

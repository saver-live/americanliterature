<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who, walking in the twilight gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hears round about him voices as it darkens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing not the forms from which they come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pauses from time to time, and turns and hearkens;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So walking here in twilight, O my friends!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear your voices, softened by the distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pause, and turn to listen, as each sends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words of friendship, comfort, and assistance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any thought of mine, or sung or told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has ever given delight or consolation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye have repaid me back a thousand-fold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By every friendly sign and salutation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the sympathies that ye have shown!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for each kindly word, each silent token,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That teaches me, when seeming most alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends are around us, though no word be spoken.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind messages, that pass from land to land;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind letters, that betray the heart's deep history,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which we feel the pressure of a hand,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One touch of fire,--and all the rest is mystery!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasant books, that silently among
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our household treasures take familiar places,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are to us as if a living tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spice from the printed leaves or pictured faces!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps on earth I never shall behold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eye of sense, your outward form and semblance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore to me ye never will grow old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But live forever young in my remembrance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never grow old, nor change, nor pass away!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your gentle voices will flow on forever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When life grows bare and tarnished with decay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As through a leafless landscape flows a river.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not chance of birth or place has made us friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being oftentimes of different tongues and nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the endeavor for the selfsame ends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the same hopes, and fears, and aspirations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I hope to join your seaside walk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saddened, and mostly silent, with emotion;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not interrupting with intrusive talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand, majestic symphonies of ocean.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I hope, as no unwelcome guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At your warm fireside, when the lamps are lighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have my place reserved among the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor stand as one unsought and uninvited!

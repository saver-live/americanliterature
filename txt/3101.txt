<p><cite class="al-title">The Federalist Papers</cite>, written in 1787-1789 by Alexander Hamilton, <a href="/author/james-madison/bio-books-stories">James Madison</a>, and John Jay, was a series of essays, "written in favour of the New Constitution, as agreed upon by the Federal Convention on September 17, 1787." This formative document served as the basis to establish the infrastructure of a new nation's government, how it would be financed and defended, and clearly differentiated the roles of federal and state governments. Before being published as a two volume set of books in 1789, the essays were printed in installments predominantly in New York periodicals, over a seven month period to communicate the nation's plan to its people. <cite class="al-title">The Federalist Papers</cite> comprises eighty-five essays and is considered a vital reference document for the United States, next to <a href="/author/thomas-jefferson/essay/the-declaration-of-independence">The Declaration of Independence</a>, <a href="/history/us-congress-senate-and-states/declaration/united-states-constitution">United States Constitution</a>, and its <a href="/history/us-congress-senate-and-states/declaration/amendments-to-the-us-constitution">Amendments</a>.

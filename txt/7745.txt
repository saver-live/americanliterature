<pre>I asked the heaven of stars
What I should give my love,
It answered me with silence,
Silence above.

I asked the darkened sea
Down where the fishers go,
It answered me with silence,
Silence below.

Oh, I could give him weeping,
Or I could give him song,
But how can I give silence,
My whole life long?

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope that you may understand!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can books of men that wive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dragon-guarded land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paintings of the dolphin-drawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-nymphs in their pearly waggons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do, but awake a hope to live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dragons?

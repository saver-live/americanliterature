<p>My imagination, obediently,<br> Conceives grey eyes.<br> In Tver, in my solitude,<br> It's you I bitterly remember.<br> <br> Happily captive in another's arms,<br> On the left bank of the Neva,<br> My famed contemporary,<br> You have all that you desired;<br> <br> You who told me: Enough,<br> Go now, quench your love!<br> And I weakly, waste away,<br> Though the blood beats more strongly.<br> <br> If I die, who will write,<br> These poems to you,<br> Whose voice will ring<br> With my still unspoken words?<br></p>

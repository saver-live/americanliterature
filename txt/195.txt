<p>A grey cloud, in the sky overhead,<br> Like a squirrel skin uncurled.<br> 'I'm not sorry your body,' he said,<br> 'Will melt in March, frail snow-girl!'<br> <br> In the soft muff my hands grew cold.<br> Ifelt afraid, somehow confused.<br> How to recall the swift weeks' flow,<br> His short-lived insubstantial love!<br> <br> I don't want bitterness or revenge,<br> Let me die with the last snow-storm.<br> My fortune told of him at year's end.<br> I was his before February was born.<br></p>

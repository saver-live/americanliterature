<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things can tempt me from this craft of verse:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time it was a womanÂ’s face, or worse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeming needs of my fool-driven land;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now nothing but comes readier to the hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than this accustomed toil. When I was young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not given a penny for a song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not the poet sing it with such airs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That one believed he had a sword upstairs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet would be now, could I but have my wish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colder and dumber and deafer than a fish.

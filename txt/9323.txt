<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly I saw the cold and rook-delighting Heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereupon imagination and heart were driven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wild that every casual thought of that and this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished, and left but memories, that should be out of season
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I took all the blame out of all sense and reason,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to quicken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the injustice of the skies for punishment?

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never stoops the soaring vulture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his quarry in the desert,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sick or wounded bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another vulture, watching
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his high aerial look-out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees the downward plunge, and follows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a third pursues the second,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the invisible ether,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a speck, and then a vulture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the air is dark with pinions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So disasters come not singly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as if they watched and waited,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanning one another's motions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first descends, the others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow, follow, gathering flock-wise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round their victim, sick and wounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a shadow, then a sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the air is dark with anguish.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, o'er all the dreary North-land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mighty Peboan, the Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing on the lakes and rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into stone had changed their waters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his hair he shook the snow-flakes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the plains were strewn with whiteness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One uninterrupted level,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if, stooping, the Creator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hand had smoothed them over.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest, wide and wailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roamed the hunter on his snow-shoes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the village worked the women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pounded maize, or dressed the deer-skin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the young men played together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ice the noisy ball-play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plain the dance of snow-shoes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One dark evening, after sundown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her wigwam Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat with old Nokomis, waiting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the steps of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward from the hunt returning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their faces gleamed the firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painting them with streaks of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glimmered like the watery moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glistened like the sun in water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind them crouched their shadows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corners of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the smoke in wreaths above them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbed and crowded through the smoke-flue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the curtain of the doorway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From without was slowly lifted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighter glowed the fire a moment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a moment swerved the smoke-wreath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As two women entered softly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed the doorway uninvited,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without word of salutation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without sign of recognition,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat down in the farthest corner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouching low among the shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their aspect and their garments,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers seemed they in the village;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very pale and haggard were they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they sat there sad and silent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling, cowering with the shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it the wind above the smoke-flue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muttering down into the wigwam?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it the owl, the Koko-koho,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hooting from the dismal forest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure a voice said in the silence:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are corpses clad in garments,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are ghosts that come to haunt you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Hereafter!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward now came Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his hunting in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the snow upon his tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the red deer on his shoulders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feet of Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down he threw his lifeless burden;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobler, handsomer she thought him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when first he came to woo her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First threw down the deer before her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a token of his wishes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a promise of the future.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned and saw the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cowering, crouching with the shadows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said within himself, "Who are they?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What strange guests has Minnehaha?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he questioned not the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only spake to bid them welcome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his lodge, his food, his fireside.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evening meal was ready,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the deer had been divided,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the pallid guests, the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springing from among the shadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized upon the choicest portions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized the white fat of the roebuck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set apart for Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the wife of Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without asking, without thanking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagerly devoured the morsels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitted back among the shadows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a word spake Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a motion made Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a gesture Laughing Water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a change came o'er their features;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Minnehaha softly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered, saying, "They are famished;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them do what best delights them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them eat, for they are famished."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a daylight dawned and darkened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a night shook off the daylight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the pine shakes off the snow-flakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the midnight of its branches;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day the guests unmoving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat there silent in the wigwam;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by night, in storm or starlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth they went into the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing fire-wood to the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing pine-cones for the burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always sad and always silent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whenever Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from fishing or from hunting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evening meal was ready,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the food had been divided,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gliding from their darksome corner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the pallid guests, the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized upon the choicest portions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set aside for Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And without rebuke or question
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitted back among the shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never once had Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a word or look reproved them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never once had old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a gesture of impatience;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never once had Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shown resentment at the outrage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All had they endured in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the rights of guest and stranger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the virtue of free-giving,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a look might not be lessened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a word might not be broken.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once at midnight Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever wakeful, ever watchful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wigwam, dimly lighted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the brands that still were burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the glimmering, flickering firelight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard a sighing, oft repeated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard a sobbing, as of sorrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his couch rose Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his shaggy hides of bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushed aside the deer-skin curtain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the pallid guests, the shadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting upright on their couches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping in the silent midnight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said: "O guests! why is it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That your hearts are so afflicted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you sob so in the midnight?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has perchance the old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has my wife, my Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wronged or grieved you by unkindness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed in hospitable duties?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the shadows ceased from weeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceased from sobbing and lamenting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they said, with gentle voices:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are ghosts of the departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Souls of those who once were with you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the realms of Chibiabos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither have we come to try you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither have we come to warn you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cries of grief and lamentation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach us in the Blessed Islands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cries of anguish from the living,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling back their friends departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadden us with useless sorrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore have we come to try you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows us, no one heeds us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are but a burden to you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we see that the departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have no place among the living.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think of this, O Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak of it to all the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That henceforward and forever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They no more with lamentations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadden the souls of the departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Islands of the Blessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not lay such heavy burdens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the graves of those you bury,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not such weight of furs and wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not such weight of pots and kettles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the spirits faint beneath them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only give them food to carry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only give them fire to light them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four days is the spirit's journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of ghosts and shadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four its lonely night encampments;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four times must their fires be lighted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the dead are buried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let a fire, as night approaches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four times on the grave be kindled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the soul upon its journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May not lack the cheerful firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May not grope about in darkness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell, noble Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put you to the trial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the proof have put your patience,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the insult of our presence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the outrage of our actions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found you great and noble.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fail not in the greater trial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint not in the harder struggle."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they ceased, a sudden darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell and filled the silent wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha heard a rustle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of garments trailing by him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the curtain of the doorway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted by a hand he saw not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt the cold breath of the night air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment saw the starlight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he saw the ghosts no longer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw no more the wandering spirits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Hereafter.

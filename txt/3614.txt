&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Clee to heaven the beacon burns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shires have seen it plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From north and south the sign returns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beacons burn again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look left, look right, the hills are bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dales are light between,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because 'tis fifty years to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That God has saved the Queen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when the flame they watch not towers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the soil they trod,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lads, we'll remember friends of ours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shared the work with God.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To skies that knit their heartstrings right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fields that bred them brave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saviours come not home to-night:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Themselves they could not save.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It dawns in Asia, tombstones show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shropshire names are read;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Nile spills his overflow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Severn's dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pledge in peace by farm and town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen they served in war,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fire the beacons up and down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land they perished for.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God Save the Queen" we living sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From height to height 'tis heard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the rest your voices ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lads of the Fifty-third.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, God will save her, fear you not:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be you the men you've been,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get you the sons your fathers got,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God will Save the Queen.

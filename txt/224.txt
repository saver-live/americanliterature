<p>Here we're all drunkards and whores,<br> Joylessly stuck together!<br> On the walls, birds and flowers<br> Pine for the clouds and air.<br> <br> The smoke from your black pipe<br> Makes strange vapours rise.<br> The skirt I wear is tight,<br> Revealing my slim thighs.<br> <br> Windows tightly closed:<br> Who's there, frost or thunder?<br> Your eyes, are they those<br> Of some cautious cat, I wonder?<br> <br> O, my heart how you yearn!<br> Is it for death you wait?<br> Or that girl, dancing there,<br> For hell to be her sure fate?<br></p>

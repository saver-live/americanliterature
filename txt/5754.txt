<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his evening fire the artist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondered o'er his secret shame;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baffled, weary, and disheartened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still he mused, and dreamed of fame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was an image of the Virgin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had tasked his utmost skill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, alas! his fair ideal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished and escaped him still.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a distant Eastern island
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the precious wood been brought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day and night the anxious master
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his toil untiring wrought;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, discouraged and desponding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat he now in shadows deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the day's humiliation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found oblivion in sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a voice cried, "Rise, O master!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the burning brand of oak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape the thought that stirs within thee!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the startled artist woke,--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woke, and from the smoking embers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized and quenched the glowing wood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefrom he carved an image,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he saw that it was good.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou sculptor, painter, poet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take this lesson to thy heart:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is best which lieth nearest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape from that thy work of art.

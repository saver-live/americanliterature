<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening came; the golden vane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment in the sunset glanced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then darkened, and then gleamed again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the east the moon advanced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touched it with a softer light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While underneath, with flowing mane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the sign the Red Horse pranced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And galloped forth into the night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But brighter than the afternoon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That followed the dark day of rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brighter than the golden vane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That glistened in the rising moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the ruddy fire-light gleamed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every separate window-pane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backed by the outer darkness, showed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mirror, where the flamelets gleamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flickered to and fro, and seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bonfire lighted in the road.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the hospitable glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an old actor on the stage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the uncertain voice of age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singing chimney chanted low
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homely songs of long ago.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice that Ossian heard of yore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When midnight winds were in his hall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ghostly and appealing call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound of days that are no more!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dark as Ossian sat the Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listened to the sound, and knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of the airy hosts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray and misty cloud of ghosts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their interminable flight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listening muttered in his beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With accent indistinct and weird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are ye, children of the Night?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beholding his mysterious face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me," the gay Sicilian said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why was it that in breaking bread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At supper, you bent down your head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, musing, paused a little space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who says a silent grace?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jew replied, with solemn air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said the Manichaean's prayer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was his faith,--perhaps is mine,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That life in all its forms is one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that its secret conduits run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen, but in unbroken line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the great fountain-head divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through man and beast, through grain and grass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe'er we struggle, strive, and cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From death there can be no escape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no escape from life, alas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we cannot die, but pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From one into another shape:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is but into life we die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore the Manichaean said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple prayer on breaking bread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest he with hasty hand or knife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might wound the incarcerated life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul in things that we call dead:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I did not reap thee, did not bind thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not thrash thee, did not grind thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did I in the oven bake thee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not I, it was another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did these things unto thee, O brother;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have thee, hold thee, break thee!'"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That birds have souls I can concede,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet cried, with glowing cheeks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flocks that from their beds of reed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprising north or southward fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flying write upon the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biforked letter of the Greeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hath been said by Rucellai;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All birds that sing or chirp or cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those migratory bands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minor poets of the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plover, peep, and sanderling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hardly can be said to sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But pipe along the barren sands,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these have souls akin to ours;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So hath the lovely race of flowers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus much I grant, but nothing more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rusty hinges of a door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not alive because they creak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chimney, with its dreary roar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rattling windows, do not speak!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To me they speak," the Jew replied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the sounds that sink and soar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the voices of a tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That breaks upon an unknown shore!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the Sicilian interfered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was your dream, then, as you dozed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment since, with eyes half-closed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmured something in your beard."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hebrew smiled, and answered, "Nay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that, but something very near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, and yet not the same, may seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of my waking dream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it wholly dies away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to me, and you shall hear."

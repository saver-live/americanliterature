<p>With a jar of wine I sit by the flowering trees.<br> I drink alone, and where are my friends?<br> Ah, the moon above looks down on me;<br> I call and lift my cup to his brightness.<br> And see, there goes my shadow before me.<br> Ho! We’re a party of three, I say,–<br> Though the poor moon can’t drink,<br> And my shadow but dances around me,<br> We’re all friends to-night,<br> The drinker, the moon and the shadow.<br> Let our revelry be suited to the spring!<br> <br> I sing, the wild moon wanders the sky.<br> I dance, my shadow goes tumbling about.<br> While we’re awake, let us join in carousal;<br> Only sweet drunkenness shall ever part us.<br> Let us pledge a friendship no mortals know,<br> And often hail each other at evening<br> Far across the vast and vaporous space!<br></p>

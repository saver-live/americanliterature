<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own shire, if I was sad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homely comforters I had:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth, because my heart was sore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrowed for the son she bore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And standing hills, long to remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared their short-lived comrade's pain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bound for the same bourn as I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On every road I wandered by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trod beside me, close and dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful and death-struck year:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether in the woodland brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the beechnut rustle down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the purple crocus pale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower about the autumn dale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or littering far the fields of May
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady-smocks a-bleaching lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like a skylit water stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bluebells in the azured wood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder, lightening other loads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seasons range the country roads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here in London streets I ken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No such helpmates, only men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these are not in plight to bear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they would, another's care.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have enough as 'tis: I see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many an eye that measures me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortal sickness of a mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too unhappy to be kind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undone with misery, all they can
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is to hate their fellow man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And till they drop they needs must still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at you and wish you ill.

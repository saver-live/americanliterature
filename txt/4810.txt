<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not love my Empires foes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor call em angels; still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the sense of atin those
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oom you are paid to kill?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, barrin all that foreign lot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which only joined for spite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself, Id just as soon as not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect the man I fight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah there, Piet!, is trousies to is knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is coat-tails lyin level in the bullet-sprinkled breeze;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E does not lose is rifle an e does not lose is seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive known a lot o people ride a dam sight worse than Piet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive eard im cryin from the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Abels blood of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An skirmished out to look, an found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggar nearly cold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive waited on till e was dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Which couldnt elp im much),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But many grateful things e s said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me for doin such.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah there, Piet! whose time as come to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is carcase past rebellion, but is eyes inquirin why.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though dressed in stolen uniform with badge o rank complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive known a lot o fellers go a dam sight worse than Piet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An when there was nt aught to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But camp and cattle-guards,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive fought with im the ole day through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At fifteen undred yards;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long afternoons o lyin still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An earin as you lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullets swish from ill to ill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like scythes among the ay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah there, Piet!-beind is stony kop.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With is Boer bread an biltong, an is flask of awful Dop;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Mauser for amusement an is pony for retreat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive known a lot o fellers shoot a dam sight worse than Piet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hes shoved is rifle neath my nose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Id time to think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An borrowed all my Sunday cloes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An sent me ome in pink;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An I ave crept (Lord, ow Ive crept!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On ands an knees Ive gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spoored and floored and caught and kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An sent him to Ceylon!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah there, Piet!, youve sold me many a pup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When week on week alternate it was you an me ands up! 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though I never made you walk man-naked in the eat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive known a lot of fellows stalk a dam sight worse than Piet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Plewmans to Marabastad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Ookiep to De Aar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me an my trusty friend ave ad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you might say, a war;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seein what both parties done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before e owned defeat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I aint more proud of avin won,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I am pleased with Piet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah there, Piet!, picked up beind the drive!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonder wasnt ow e fought, but ow e kep alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With nothin in is belly, on is back, or to is feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive known a lot o men behave a dam sight worse than Piet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more Ill ear is rifle crack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the blockouse fence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggars on the peaceful tack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of expense;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For countin what e eats an draws,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An gifts an loans as well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Es gettin alf the Earth, because
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E didnt give us Ell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah there, Piet! with your brand-new English plough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your gratis tents an cattle, an your most ungrateful frow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youve made the British taxpayer rebuild your country seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive known some pet battalions charge a dam sight less than Piet.

<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll to the weeds no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laurels are all cut,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bowers are bare of bay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That once the Muses wore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year draws in the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon will evening shut:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laurels all are cut,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll to the woods no more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh we'll no more, no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the leafy woods away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the high wild woods of laurel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bowers of bay no more.
</pre>

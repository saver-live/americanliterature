<p>TO what a cumbersome unwieldiness<br> And burdenous corpulence my love had grown,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>But that I did, to make it less,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>And keep it in proportion,<br> Give it a diet, made it feed upon<br> That which love worst endures, discretion<br> <br> Above one sigh a day I allow'd him not,<br> Of which my fortune, and my faults had part;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>And if sometimes by stealth he got<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>A she sigh from my mistress' heart,<br> And thought to feast upon that, I let him see<br> 'Twas neither very sound, nor meant to me.<br> <br> If he wrung from me a tear, I brined it so<br> With scorn and shame, that him it nourish'd not;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>If he suck'd hers, I let him know<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>'Twas not a tear which he had got;<br> His drink was counterfeit, as was his meat;<br> For eyes, which roll towards all, weep not, but sweat.<br> <br> Whatever he would dictate I writ that,<br> But burnt her letters when she writ to me;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>And if that favour made him fat,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>I said, "If any title be<br> Convey'd by this, ah! what doth it avail,<br> To be the fortieth name in an entail?"<br> <br> Thus I reclaim'd my buzzard love, to fly<br> At what, and when, and how, and where I choose.<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Now negligent of sports I lie,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>And now, as other falconers use,<br> I spring a mistress, swear, write, sigh, and weep;<br> And the game kill'd, or lost, go talk or sleep.</p>

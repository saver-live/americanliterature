<p>Evening hours at the desk,<br> The page irremediably white,<br> The mimosa's scent is of Nice, warmth,<br> Over the moon some vast bird flies.<br> <br> And, twining my braids for night,<br> As if I must wear them tomorrow,<br> Ilook from the window at sand-dunes, sea,<br> Free of sorrow.<br> <br> How much power a man has<br> Who doesn't ask for affection!<br> I can't even lift my weary eyelids<br> When he chooses to speak my name.<br></p>

<p> Shirley Jackson's short story <span class="al-title">The Lottery</span> was published in 1948 and it is not in the public domain. </p><p> Accordingly, we are prohibited from presenting the full text here in our short story collection, but we can present a summary of the story, along with by some study questions, commentary, and explanations. You can also listen to the audiobook reading at the bottom of this page. </p><p> <small style="font-size:90%;"><em> It is important to have some historical context to understand this story and the negative reaction that it generated when it appeared in the June 26, 1948 issue of <span class="al-periodical">The New Yorker</span>. The setting for the story, a gathering in a small rural village, wasn't a fictional construct in America in the summer of 1948. The setting was emblematic of "small town America" and many people identified directly with the setting and the gathering depicted. It was customary at that time for rural community leaders to organize summertime gatherings to draw people together in town centers to socialize and to frequent and support some of the town's business establishments. It was thought to be good for the businesses and good for the community. These gatherings were usually organized by the city council and featured lotteries with modest cash-prizes to help lure people into their vehicles for the long drive to town. So the scene was instantly recognizable to readers -- especially rural readers -- when the story was published, and they did not like the way that this particular story developed and concluded. Many interpreted the story as an attack on the values of rural communities and "small town America." As a result, the story engendered an unanticipated avalanche of anger and criticism. </em></small> </p><p> <small style="font-size:90%;"><em> Here is a summary of the story, which will be followed by additional commentary. </em></small> </p><p><br> On a warm summer day, villagers gather in a town square to participate in a lottery. The village is small with about 300 residents, and they are in an excited but anxious mood. We learn that this is an annual event and that some surrounding towns are thinking about abandoning the lottery. Mrs. (Tess) Hutchinson makes an undramatic entrance and chats briefly with Mrs. Delacroix, her friend. </p><p> The night before Mr. Summers, a town leader who officiates the lottery, had made paper slips listing all the families with the help of Mr. Graves (subtle name choice?). The slips were stored overnight in a safe at the coal company. </p><p> The villagers start to gather at 10 a.m. so that they may finish in time for lunch. Children busy themselves collecting stones -- one of those odd details that will later emerge loaded with meaning -- until the proceedings get underway and they are called together by their parents. </p><p> Mr. Summers works down the list of families, summoning the head man of each household. A male sixteen years or older comes forward and draws a slip of paper. When every family has a slip of paper, Mr. Summers has everyone look at the slip, and we discover that Bill Hutchinson has drawn the one slip with a black spot. It's his family that has been chosen. Mrs. Hutchinson begins to protest. With tension mounting, it becomes clear that "winning" this lottery isn't going to be what we expected, and that the "winner" isn't going to walk away with a pile of cash. </p><p> Once a family is chosen, the second round begins. In this round, each family member, no matter how old or young, must draw a slip of paper. It is Tess Hutchinson who draws the slip with the black circle. While Mrs. Hutchinson protests the unfairness of the situation, each of the villagers picks up a stone -- "And someone gave little Davy Hutchinson a few pebbles" -- and closes in on her. The story ends with Mrs. Hutchinson being stoned to death while protesting, "It isn't fair, it isn't right." The story concludes with six of the most famous closing words in short story history, <em>"And then they were upon her."</em> </p><p> For those of you that have landed on this page looking for the secret to winning the lottery, I have a few thoughts . . . </p><p> First, good luck to you. I hope you win. </p><p> Second, there is no magic formula, and the odds of winning are extremely low. So balance your participation modestly, never spend more than you can afford. Enjoy dreaming about what you will do if you win. </p><p> Lastly, keep in mind, that no matter how often you play and lose, your worst loss is better than Tess Hutchinson's win! </p><p>Finally, here is an audiobook that will allow you to listen to the full text of <span class="al-title">The Lottery</span></p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

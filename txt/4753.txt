<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry, our King in England, from London town is gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And comen to Hamull on the Hoke in the Countie of Suthampton.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there lay the Mary of the Tower, his ship of war so strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he would discover, certaynely, if his shipwrights did him wrong.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told not none of his setting forth, nor yet where he would go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(But only my Lord of Arundel) and meanly did he show,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an old jerkin and patched hose that no man might him mark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his frieze hood and cloak above, he looked like any clerk.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was at Hamull on the Hoke about the hour of the tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the Mary haled into dock, the winter to abide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all her tackle and habilaments which are the King his own;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then ran on his false shipwrights and stripped her to the bone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heaved the main-mast overboard, that was of a trusty tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they wrote down it was spent and lost by force of weather at sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they sawen it into planks and strakes as far as it might go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maken beds for their own wives and little children also.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knave called Slingawai, he crope beneath the deck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying: Good felawes, come and see! The ship is nigh a wreck!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the storm that took our tall main-mast, it blew so fierce and fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alack! it hath taken the kettles and pans, and this brass pott as well!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that he set the pott on his head and hied him up the hatch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all the shipwrights ran below to find what they might snatch;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All except Bob Brygandyne and he was a yeoman good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught Slingawai round the waist and threw him on to the mud.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken plank and rope and nail, without the King his leave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the custom of Portesmouth, but I will not suffer a thief.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, never lift up thy hand at me, theres no clean hands in the trade.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steal in measure, quo Brygandyne. Theres measure in all things made!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gramercy, yeoman! said our King. Thy council liketh me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he pulled a whistle out of his neck and whistled whistles three.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came my Lord of Arundel pricking across the down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him the Mayor and Burgesses of merry Suthampton town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They drew the naughty shipwrights up, with the kettles in their hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bound them round the forecastle to wait the Kings commands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sith ye have made your beds, said the King, ye needs must lie thereon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of your wives and little ones, felawes, get you gone!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they had beaten Slingawai, out of his own lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our King appointed Brygandyne to be Clerk of all his ships.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, never lift up thy hands to me, theres no clean hands in the trade.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But steal in measure, said Harry our King. Theres measure in all things made!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God speed the Mary of the Tower, the Sovereign, and Grace Dieu,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sweepstakes and the Mary Fortune, and the Henry of Bristol too !
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All tall ships that sail on the sea, or in our harbours stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they may keep measure with Harry our King and peace in Engeland !

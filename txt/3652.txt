&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun at noon to higher air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unharnessing the silver Pair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That late before his chariot swam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rides on the gold wool of the Ram.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So braver notes the storm-cock sings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start the rusted wheel of things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brutes in field and brutes in pen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leap that the world goes round again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys are up the woods with day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fetch the daffodils away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And home at noonday from the hills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They bring no dearth of daffodils.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afield for palms the girls repair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sure enough the palms are there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each will find by hedge or pond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her waving silver-tufted wand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In farm and field through all the shire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye beholds the heart's desire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, let not only mine be vain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For lovers should be loved again.

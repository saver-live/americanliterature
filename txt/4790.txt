<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things made he, Shiva the Preserver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He made all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mothers heart for sleepy head, O little Son of mine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheat he gave to rich folk, millet to the poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cattle to the tiger, carrion to the kite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught he found too lofty, none he saw too low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parbati beside him watched them come and go;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she tricked him, Shiva the Preserver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahadeo! Mahadeo, turn and see!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this was Least of Little Things, O little Son of mine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dole was ended, laughingly she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master, of a million mouths is not one unfed?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing, Shiv made answer, All have had their part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even he, the little one, hidden 'neath thy heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her breast she plucked it, Parbati the thief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the Least of Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw and feared and wondered, making prayer to Shiv,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath surely given meat to all that live!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things made he, Shiva the Preserver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He made all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine, find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mothers heart for sleepy head, O little Son of mine

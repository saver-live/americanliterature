<p>So many stones are thrown at me<br> That I no longer cower,<br> The turret's cage is shapely,<br> High among high towers.<br> My thanks, to its builders,<br> May they evade pain and woe,<br> Here, I see suns rise earlier,<br> Here, their last splendours glow.<br> And often winds from northern seas<br> Fill the windows of my sanctuary,<br> And a dove eats corn from my palmâ€¦<br> And divinely light and calm,<br> The Muse's sunburnt hand's at play,<br> Finishing my unfinished page.<br></p>

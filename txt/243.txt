<p>I was not born too early or too late,<br> The time was uniquely blessed,<br> Only the Lord did not permit<br> My heart to live without illusion.<br> <br> That's why it's dark in the living-room,<br> That's why my friends,<br> Like sorrowful twilight birds,<br> Sing of past non-existent love.<br></p>

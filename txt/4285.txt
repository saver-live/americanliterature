<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All gentle folks who owe a grudge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any living thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your ears and stay your t[r]udge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I in dudgeon sing.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gadfly he hath stung me sore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O may he ne'er sting you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have many a horrid bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may sting black and blue.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has any here an old grey Mare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With three legs all her store,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O put it to her Buttocks bare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight she'll run on four.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has any here a Lawyer suit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of 1743,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Lawyer's nose and put it to't
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you the end will see.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a Man in Parliament
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dum[b-] founder'd in his speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let his neighbour make a rent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put one in his breech.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Lowther how much better thou
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hadst figur'd t'other day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When to the folks thou mad'st a bow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hadst no more to say.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If lucky Gadfly had but ta'en
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His seat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put thee to a little pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save thee from a worse.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than Southey it had been,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than Mr. D-------,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than Wordsworth too, I ween,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than Mr. V-------.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me pray good people all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For deviating so --
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spirit sure I had a call --
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I on will go.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has any here a daughter fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too fond of reading novels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too apt to fall in love with care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And charming Mister Lovels,


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O put a Gadfly to that thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She keeps so white and pert --
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean the finger for the ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it will breed a wort.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has any here a pious spouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who seven times a day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scolds as King David pray'd, to chouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have her holy way --


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let a Gadfly's little sting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuade her sacred tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That noises are a common thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that her bell has rung.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as this is the summon bo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;num of all conquering,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave "withouten wordes mo"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gadfly's little sting.

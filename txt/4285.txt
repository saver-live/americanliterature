<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dark vapors have oppress'd our plains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long dreary season, comes a day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born of the gentle South, and clears away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sick heavens all unseemly stains.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anxious month, relieved of its pains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes as a long-lost right the feel of May;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyelids with the passing coolness play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like rose leaves with the drip of Summer rains.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calmest thoughts came round us; as of leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budding, fruit ripening in stillness, Autumn suns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling at eve upon the quiet sheaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Sappho's cheek, a smiling infant's breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gradual sand that through an hour-glass runs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woodland rivulet, a Poet's death.

<p>THOUGH life should come<br> With all its marshalled honours, trump and drum,<br> To proffer you the captaincy of some<br> Resounding exploit, that shall fill<br> Man's pulses with commemorative thrill,<br> And be a banner to far battle days<br> For truths unrisen upon untrod ways,<br> What would your answer be,<br> O heart once brave?<br> <i>Seek otherwhere; for me,</i><br> <i>I watch beside a grave.</i><br> <br> Though to some shining festival of thought<br> The sages call you from steep citadel<br> Of bastioned argument, whose rampart gained<br> Yields the pure vision passionately sought,<br> In dreams known well,<br> But never yet in wakefulness attained,<br> How should you answer to their summons, save:<br> <i>I watch beside a grave?</i><br> <br> Though Beauty, from her fane within the soul<br> Of fire-tongued seers descending,<br> Or from the dream-lit temples of the past<br> With feet immortal wending,<br> Illuminate grief's antre swart and vast<br> With half-veiled face that promises the whole<br> To him who holds her fast,<br> What answer could you give?<br> <i>Sight of one face I crave,</i><br> <i>One only while I live;</i><br> <i>Woo elsewhere; for I watch beside a grave.</i><br> <br> Though love of the one heart that loves you best,<br> A storm-tossed messenger,<br> Should beat its wings for shelter in your breast,<br> Where clung its last year's nest,<br> The nest you built together and made fast<br> Lest envious winds should stir,<br> And winged each delicate thought to minister<br> With sweetness far-amassed<br> To the young dreams withinâ€”<br> What answer could it win?<br> <i>The nest was whelmed in sorrow's rising wave,</i><br> <i>Nor could I reach one drowning dream to save;</i><br> <i>I watch beside a grave.</i></p>

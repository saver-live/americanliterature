<p>Life is a dream. No need to stir.<br> Remembering this I'm drunk all day.<br> Lying helpless beside the porch,<br> Waking to see the deep garden.<br> One bird calls among the flowers.<br> Ask myself what's the season?<br> Song of the oriole in Spring breezes,<br> Voice of beauty sadly moves me.<br> Is there wine? Ah, fill the cup.<br> Sing and watch the white moon rise,<br> until song's end and sense is gone. <br></p>

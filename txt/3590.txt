<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot? so quick, so clean an ending?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh that was right, lad, that was brave:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours was not an ill for mending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas best to take it to the grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh you had forethought, you could reason,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw your road and where it led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And early wise and brave in season
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the pistol to your head.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh soon, and better so than later
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After long disgrace and scorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shot dead the household traitor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul that should not have been born.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right you guessed the rising morrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scorned to tread the mire you must:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust's your wages, son of sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But men may come to worse than dust.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Souls undone, undoing others,-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time since the tale began.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would not live to wrong your brothers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh lad, you died as fits a man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to your grave shall friend and stranger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ruth and some with envy come:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undishonoured, clear of danger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean of guilt, pass hence and home.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn safe to rest, no dreams, no waking;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, man, here's the wreath I've made:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis not a gift that's worth the taking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wear it and it will not fade.
</pre>

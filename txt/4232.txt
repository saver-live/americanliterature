<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What though, for showing truth to flatter'd state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind Hunt was shut in prison, yet has he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his immortal spirit, been as free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sky-searching lark, and as elate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minion of grandeur! think you he did wait?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think you he nought but prison-walls did see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, so unwilling, thou unturn'dst the key?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, no! far happier, nobler was his fate!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Spenser's halls he stray'd, and bowers fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culling enchanted flowers; and he flew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With daring Milton through the fields of air:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To regions of his own his genius true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took happy flights. Who shall his fame impair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou art dead, and all thy wretched crew?

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full many a dreary hour have I past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brain bewildered, and my mind o'ercast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With heaviness; in seasons when I've thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No spherey strains by me could e'er be caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the blue dome, though I to dimness gaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the far depth where sheeted lightning plays;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, on the wavy grass outstretched supinely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pry 'mong the stars, to strive to think divinely:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should never hear Apollo's song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though feathery clouds were floating all along
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple west, and, two bright streaks between,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lyre itself were dimly seen:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the still murmur of the honey bee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would never teach a rural song to me:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the bright glance from beauty's eyelids slanting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would never make a lay of mine enchanting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or warm my breast with ardour to unfold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tale of love and arms in time of old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are times, when those that love the bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly from all sorrowing far, far away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden glow comes on them, nought they see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In water, earth, or air, but poesy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said, dear George, and true I hold it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For knightly Spenser to Libertas told it,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That when a Poet is in such a trance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In air her sees white coursers paw, and prance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bestridden of gay knights, in gay apparel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who at each other tilt in playful quarrel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what we, ignorantly, sheet-lightning call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the swift opening of their wide portal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bright warder blows his trumpet clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose tones reach nought on earth but Poet's ear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these enchanted portals open wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the light the horsemen swiftly glide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet's eye can reach those golden halls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And view the glory of their festivals:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ladies fair, that in the distance seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fit for the silv'ring of a seraph's dream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their rich brimmed goblets, that incessant run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the bright spots that move about the sun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when upheld, the wine from each bright jar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pours with the lustre of a falling star.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet further off, are dimly seen their bowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which, no mortal eye can reach the flowers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'tis right just, for well Apollo knows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould make the Poet quarrel with the rose.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that's revealed from that far seat of blisses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the clear fountains' interchanging kisses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As gracefully descending, light and thin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like silver streaks across a dolphin's fin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he upswimmeth from the coral caves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sports with half his tail above the waves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wonders strange he sees, and many more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose head is pregnant with poetic lore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he upon an evening ramble fare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With forehead to the soothing breezes bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he nought see but the dark, silent blue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its diamonds trembling through and through?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the coy moon, when in the waviness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And staidly paces higher up, and higher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sweet nun in holy-day attire?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, yes! much more would start into his sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revelries and mysteries of night:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And should I ever see them, I will tell you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such tales as needs must with amazement spell you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the living pleasures of the bard:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But richer far posterity's reward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he murmur with his latest breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his proud eye looks though the film of death?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What though I leave this dull and earthly mould,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet shall my spirit lofty converse hold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With after times. The patriot shall feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My stern alarum, and unsheath his steel;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, in the senate thunder out my numbers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To startle princes from their easy slumbers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage will mingle with each moral theme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My happy thoughts sententious; he will teem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lofty periods when my verses fire him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I'll stoop from heaven to inspire him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lays have I left of such a dear delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That maids will sing them on their bridal night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay villagers, upon a morn of May,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they have tired their gentle limbs with play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And formed a snowy circle on the grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And placed in midst of all that lovely lass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who chosen is their queen, with her fine head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned with flowers purple, white, and red:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are emblems true of hapless lovers dying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between her breasts, that never yet felt trouble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bunch of violets full blown, and double,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serenely sleep: she from a casket takes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little book, and then a joy awakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About each youthful heart, with stifled cries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One that I fostered in my youthful years:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must ever and anon with silent creep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lured by the innocent dimples. To sweet rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall the dear babe, upon its mother's breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be lulled with songs of mine. Fair world, adieu!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy dales, and hills, are fading from my view:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly I mount, upon wide spreading pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the narrow bound of thy dominions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full joy I feel, while thus I cleave the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And warm thy sons!" Ah, my dear friend and brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I, at once, my mad ambition smother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tasting joys like these, sure I should be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happier, and dearer to society.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, 'tis true, I've felt relief from pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some bright thought has darted through my brain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all that day I've felt a greater pleasure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than if I'd brought to light a hidden treasure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to my sonnets, though none else should heed them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel delighted, still, that you should read them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched on the grass at my best loved employment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of scribbling lines for you. These things I thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, in my face, the freshest breeze I caught.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en now I'm pillowed on a bed of flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the ocean-waves, The stalks, and blades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chequer my tablet with their quivering shades.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side is a field of drooping oats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through which the poppies show their scarlet coats;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So pert and useless, that they bring to mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scarlet coats that pester human-kind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the other side, outspread, is seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocean's blue mantle streaked with purple, and green.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now 'tis I see a canvassed ship, and now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark the bright silver curling round her prow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the lark dowm-dropping to his nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the broad winged sea-gull never at rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when no more he spreads his feathers free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His breast is dancing on the restless sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I direct my eyes into the west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why westward turn? 'Twas but to say adieu!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas but to kiss my hand, dear George, to you!

<p><b>I</b><br> ON immemorial altitudes august<br> Grief holds her high dominion. Bold the feet<br> That climb unblenching to that stern retreat<br> Whence, looking down, man knows himself but dust.<br> There lie the mightiest passions, earthward thrust<br> Beneath her regnant footstool, and there meet<br> Pale ghosts of buried longings that were sweet,<br> With many an abdicated "shall" and "must."<br> <br> For there she rules omnipotent, whose will<br> Compels a mute acceptance of her chart;<br> Who holds the world, and lo! it cannot fill<br> Her mighty hand; who will be served apart<br> With uncommunicable rites, and still<br> Surrender of the undivided heart.<br> <br> <b>II</b><br> She holds the world within her mighty hand,<br> And lo! it is a toy for babes to toss,<br> And all its shining imagery but dross,<br> To those that in her awful presence stand;<br> As sun-confronting eagles o'er the land<br> That lies below, they send their gaze across<br> The common intervals of gain and loss,<br> And hope's infinitude without a strand.<br> <br> But he who, on that lonely eminence,<br> Watches too long the whirling of the spheres<br> Through dim eternities, descending thence<br> The voices of his kind no longer hears,<br> And, blinded by the spectacle immense,<br> Journeys alone through all the after years.</p>

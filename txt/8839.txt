<p>ONE grief there is, the helpmeet of my heart,<br> That shall not from me till my days be sped,<br> That walks beside me in sunshine and in shade,<br> And hath in all my fortunes equal part.<br> At first I feared it, and would often start<br> Aghast to find it bending o'er my bed,<br> Till usage slowly dulled the edge of dread,<br> And one cold night I cried: _How warm thou art!_<br> <br> Since then we two have travelled hand in hand,<br> And, lo, my grief has been interpreter<br> For me in many a fierce and alien land<br> Whose speech young Joy had failed to understand,<br> Plucking me tribute of red gold and myrrh<br> From desolate whirlings of the desert sand.</p>

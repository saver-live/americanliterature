<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are not taken; there are left behind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living Belov√®ds, tender looks to bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make the daylight still a happy thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tender voices, to make soft the wind:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it were not so, if I could find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No love in all this world for comforting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any path but hollowly did ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where 'dust to dust' the love from life disjoin'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if, before those sepulchres unmoving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood alone (as some forsaken lamb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes bleating up the moors in weary dearth)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying 'Where are ye, O my loved and loving?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know a voice would sound, 'Daughter, I am.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I suffice for Heaven and not for earth?'

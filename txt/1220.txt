<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We overstate the ills of life, and take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagination (given us to bring down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choirs of singing angels overshone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By God's clear glory) down our earth to rake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dismal snows instead, flake following flake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cover all the corn; we walk upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of hills across a level thrown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pant like climbers: near the alder brake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sigh so loud, the nightingale within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refuses to sing loud, as else she would.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O brothers, let us leave the shame and sin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of taking vainly, in a plaintive mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy name of grief! holy herein
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That by the grief of one came all our good.
</pre>

<p>For Nikolai Nedobrovo<br> <br> There's a secret border in human closeness,<br> That love's being, love's passion, cannot pass –<br> Though lips are sealed together in dreadful silence,<br> Though hearts break in two with love's distress.<br> <br> And friendship too is powerless, and years<br> Of sublime flame-filled happiness,<br> When the soul itself is free, a stranger,<br> To the slow languor of sensuality.<br> <br> Those who try to reach that boundary are mad,<br> And those who have – are filled with anguish.<br> Now you know, now you understand,<br> Why my heart won't beat at your caress.<br></p>

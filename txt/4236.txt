<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keen, fitful gusts are whisp'ring here and there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the bushes half leafless, and dry;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars look very cold about the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have many miles on foot to fare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet feel I little of the cool bleak air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of the dead leaves rustling drearily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of those silver lamps that burn on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of the distance from home's pleasant lair:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am brimfull of the friendliness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in a little cottage I have found;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fair-hair'd Milton's eloquent distress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his love for gentle Lycid drown'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lovely Laura in her light green dress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faithful Petrarch gloriously crown'd.

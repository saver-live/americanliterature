<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen she sent to look for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant he did say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young man, a soldier will you be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thirteen pence a day?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thirteen pence a day did I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take off the things I wore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have marched to where I lie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall march no more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mouth is dry, my shirt is wet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood runs all away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now I shall not die in debt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thirteen pence a day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow after new young men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant he must see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For things will all be over then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the Queen and me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall have to bate my price,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For in the grave, they say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is neither knowledge nor device
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor thirteen pence a day.
</pre>

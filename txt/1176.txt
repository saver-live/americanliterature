<p>There's little joy in life for me,<br> And little terror in the grave;<br> I've lived the parting hour to see<br> Of one I would have died to save.<br> <br> Calmly to watch the failing breath,<br> Wishing each sigh might be the last;<br> Longing to see the shade of death<br> O'er those beloved features cast.<br> <br> The cloud, the stillness that must part<br> The darling of my life from me;<br> And then to thank God from my heart,<br> To thank Him well and fervently;<br> <br> Although I knew that we had lost<br> The hope and glory of our life;<br> And now, benighted, tempest-tossed,<br> Must bear alone the weary strife.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Hermes once took to his feathers light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lulled Argus, baffled, swoon'd and slept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on a Delphic reed my idle spright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So play'd, so charm'd, so conquer'd, so bereft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, seeing it asleep, so fled away:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor unto Tempe where Jove griev'd a day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to that second circle of sad hell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where 'mid the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale were the lips I kiss'd, and fair the form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I floated with, about that melancholy storm.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy is England! I could be content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see no other verdure than its own;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel no other breezes than are blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through its tall woods with high romances blent:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet do I sometimes feel a languishment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For skies Italian, and an inward groan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sit upon an Alp as on a throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half forget what world or worldling meant.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy is England, sweet her artless daughters;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough their simple loveliness for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough their whitest arms in silence clinging:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet do I often warmly burn to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauties of deeper glance, and hear their singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And float with them about the summer waters.

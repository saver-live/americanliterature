<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I would muse in boyhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild green woods among,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nurse resolves and fancies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the world was young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not foes to conquer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor sweethearts to be kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was friends to die for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I would seek and find.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought them far and found them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sure, the straight, the brave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearts I lost my own to,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The souls I could not save.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They braced their belts about them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They crossed in ships the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sought and found six feet of ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there they died for me.

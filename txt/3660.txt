<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lads in their hundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there with the rest are the lads that will never be old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many to count are the stalwart, and many the brave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish one could know them, I wish there were tokens to tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch them depart on the way that they will not return.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now you may stare as you like and there's nothing to scan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brushing your elbow unguessed-at and not to be told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lads that will die in their glory and never be old.

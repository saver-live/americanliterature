<pre>Made from a fetter of Bonnivard, the Prisoner of Chillon; the handle of wood from the Frigate Constitution, and bound with a circlet of gold, inset with three precious stones from Siberia, Ceylon, and Maine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought this Pen would arise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the casket where it lies--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of itself would arise and write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thanks and my surprise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you gave it me under the pines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamed these gems from the mines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Siberia, Ceylon, and Maine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would glimmer as thoughts in the lines;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this iron link from the chain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Bonnivard might retain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some verse of the Poet who sang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the prisoner and his pain;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this wood from the frigate's mast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might write me a rhyme at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it used to write on the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song of the sea and the blast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But motionless as I wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a Bishop lying in state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies the Pen, with its mitre of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its jewels inviolate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then must I speak, and say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the light of that summer day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the garden under the pines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not fade and pass away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall see you standing there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caressed by the fragrant air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the shadow on your face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sunshine on your hair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall hear the sweet low tone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a voice before unknown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "This is from me to you--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From me, and to you alone."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in words not idle and vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall answer and thank you again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the gift, and the grace of the gift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O beautiful Helen of Maine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forever this gift will be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a blessing from you to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a drop of the dew of your youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the leaves of an aged tree.
</pre>

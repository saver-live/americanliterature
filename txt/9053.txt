<p> "What is good for a bootless bene?"<br> With these dark words begins my Tale;<br> And their meaning is, whence can comfort spring<br> When Prayer is of no avail?<br> <br> "What is good for a bootless bene?"<br> The Falconer to the Lady said;<br> And she made answer "ENDLESS SORROW!"<br> For she knew that her Son was dead.<br> <br> She knew it by the Falconer's words,<br> And from the look of the Falconer's eye;<br> And from the love which was in her soul<br> For her youthful Romilly.<br> <br> --Young Romilly through Barden woods<br> Is ranging high and low;<br> And holds a greyhound in a leash,<br> To let slip upon buck or doe.<br> <br> The pair have reached that fearful chasm,<br> How tempting to bestride!<br> For lordly Wharf is there pent in<br> With rocks on either side. <br> <br> This striding-place is called THE STRID,<br> A name which it took of yore:<br> A thousand years hath it borne that name,<br> And shall a thousand more.<br> <br> And hither is young Romilly come,<br> And what may now forbid<br> That he, perhaps for the hundredth time,<br> Shall bound across THE STRID?<br> <br> He sprang in glee,--for what cared he<br> That the river was strong, and the rocks were steep?-- <br> But the greyhound in the leash hung back,<br> And checked him in his leap.<br> <br> The Boy is in the arms of Wharf,<br> And strangled by a merciless force;<br> For never more was young Romilly seen<br> Till he rose a lifeless corse.<br> <br> Now there is stillness in the vale,<br> And long, unspeaking, sorrow:<br> Wharf shall be to pitying hearts<br> A name more sad than Yarrow. <br> <br> If for a lover the Lady wept,<br> A solace she might borrow<br> From death, and from the passion of death;--<br> Old Wharf might heal her sorrow.<br> <br> She weeps not for the wedding-day<br> Which was to be to-morrow:<br> Her hope was a further-looking hope,<br> And hers is a mother's sorrow.<br> <br> He was a tree that stood alone,<br> And proudly did its branches wave; <br> And the root of this delightful tree<br> Was in her husband's grave!<br> <br> Long, long in darkness did she sit,<br> And her first words were, "Let there be<br> In Bolton, on the field of Wharf,<br> A stately Priory!"<br> <br> The stately Priory was reared;<br> And Wharf, as he moved along,<br> To matins joined a mournful voice,<br> Nor failed at evensong. <br> <br> And the Lady prayed in heaviness<br> That looked not for relief!<br> But slowly did her succour come,<br> And a patience to her grief.<br> <br> Oh! there is never sorrow of heart<br> That shall lack a timely end,<br> If but to God we turn, and ask<br> Of Him to be our friend!<br> </p>

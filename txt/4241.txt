<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm breath, light whisper, tender semitone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright eyes, accomplished shape, and lang'rous waist!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded the flower and all its budded charms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished unseasonably at shut of eve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dusk holiday, or holinight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fragrant-curtained love begins to weave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as I've read love's missal through today,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray.

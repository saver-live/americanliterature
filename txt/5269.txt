<p>Fear ye not the stormy future, for the Battle Hymn is strong,<br> And the armies of Australia shall not march without a song;<br> The glorious words and music of Australia's song shall come<br> When her true hearts rush together at the beating of a drum.<br> <br></p>
<p>We may not be there to hear it â€“ 'twill be written in the night,<br> And Australia's foes shall fear it in the hour before the fight.<br> The glorious words and music from a lonely heart shall come<br> When our sons shall rush to danger at the beating of the drum.<br> <br></p>
<p>He shall be unknown who writes it; he shall soon forgotten be,<br> But the song shall ring through ages as a song of liberty.<br> And I say the words and music of our battle hymn shall come,<br> When Australia wakes in anger at the beating of a drum.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One summer morning, when the sun was hot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary with labor in his garden-plot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a rude bench beneath his cottage eaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo sat among the leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a huge vine, that, with its arms outspread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung its delicious clusters overhead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below him, through the lovely valley flowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river Arno, like a winding road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from its banks were lifted high in air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spires and roofs of Florence called the Fair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him a marble tomb, that rose above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wasted fortunes and his buried love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there, in banquet and in tournament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wealth had lavished been, his substance spent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To woo and lose, since ill his wooing sped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna, who his rival wed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet ever in his fancy reigned supreme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal woman of a young man's dream.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he withdrew, in poverty and pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this small farm, the last of his domain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only comfort and his only care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prune his vines, and plant the fig and pear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only forester and only guest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His falcon, faithful to him, when the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose willing hands had found so light of yore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brazen knocker of his palace door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had now no strength to lift the wooden latch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companion of his solitary ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purveyor of his feasts on holidays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On him this melancholy man bestowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love with which his nature overflowed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the empty-handed years went round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacant, though voiceful with prophetic sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, that summer morn, he sat and mused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With folded, patient hands, as he was used,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreamily before his half-closed sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated the vision of his lost delight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him, motionless, the drowsy bird
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamed of the chase, and in his slumber heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden, scythe-like sweep of wings, that dare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headlong plunge thro' eddying gulfs of air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, starting broad awake upon his perch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinkled his bells, like mass-bells in a church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, looking at his master, seemed to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ser Federigo, shall we hunt to-day?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo thought not of the chase;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tender vision of her lovely face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not say he seems to see, he sees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the leaf-shadows of the trellises,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself, yet not herself; a lovely child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flowing tresses, and eyes wide and wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming undaunted up the garden walk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking not at him, but at the hawk.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful falcon!" said he, "would that I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might hold thee on my wrist, or see thee fly!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice was hers, and made strange echoes start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the haunted chambers of his heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aeolian harp through gusty doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some old ruin its wild music pours.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is thy mother, my fair boy?" he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand laid softly on that shining head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monna Giovanna.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you let me stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while, and with your falcon play?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live there, just beyond your garden wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great house behind the poplars tall."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he spake on; and Federigo heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from afar each softly uttered word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drifted onward through the golden gleams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shadows of the misty sea of dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mariners becalmed through vapors drift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel the sea beneath them sink and lift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear far off the mournful breakers roar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And voices calling faintly from the shore!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, waking from his pleasant reveries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the little boy upon his knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told him stories of his gallant bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in their friendship he became a third.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna, widowed in her prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had come with friends to pass the summer time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her grand villa, half-way up the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erlooking Florence, but retired and still;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With iron gates, that opened through long lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sacred ilex and centennial pines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And terraced gardens, and broad steps of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sylvan deities, with moss o'ergrown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fountains palpitating in the heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all Val d'Arno stretched beneath its feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in seclusion, as a widow may,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely lady whiled the hours away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pacing in sable robes the statued hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself the stateliest statue among all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing more and more, with secret joy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband risen and living in her boy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the lost sense of life returned again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as delight, but as relief from pain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the boy, rejoicing in his strength,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stormed down the terraces from length to length;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming peacock chased in hot pursuit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And climbed the garden trellises for fruit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his chief pastime was to watch the flight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a gerfalcon, soaring into sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the trees that fringed the garden wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then downward stooping at some distant call;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he gazed full often wondered he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who might the master of the falcon be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until that happy morning, when he found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master and falcon in the cottage ground.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now a shadow and a terror fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the great house, as if a passing-bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolled from the tower, and filled each spacious room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With secret awe, and preternatural gloom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petted boy grew ill, and day by day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pined with mysterious malady away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's heart would not be comforted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her darling seemed to her already dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And often, sitting by the sufferer's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do to comfort thee?" she cried.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first the silent lips made no reply,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But moved at length by her importunate cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me," he answered, with imploring tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ser Federigo's falcon for my own!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answer could the astonished mother make;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could she ask, e'en for her darling's sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such favor at a luckless lover's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well knowing that to ask was to command?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well knowing, what all falconers confessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the land that falcon was the best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master's pride and passion and delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sole pursuivant of this poor knight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet, for her child's sake, she could no less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than give assent to soothe his restlessness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So promised, and then promising to keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her promise sacred, saw him fall asleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morrow was a bright September morn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth was beautiful as if new-born;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was that nameless splendor everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wild exhilaration in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes the passers in the city street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulate each other as they meet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two lovely ladies, clothed in cloak and hood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed through the garden gate into the wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lustrous leaves, and through the sheen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dewy sunshine showering down between.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one, close-hooded, had the attractive grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which sorrow sometimes lends a woman's face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dark eyes moistened with the mists that roll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gulf-stream of passion in the soul;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other with her hood thrown back, her hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a golden glory in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cheeks suffused with an auroral blush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her young heart singing louder than the thrush.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So walked, that morn, through mingled light and shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each by the other's presence lovelier made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna and her bosom friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intent upon their errand and its end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found Ser Federigo at his toil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like banished Adam, delving in the soil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he looked and these fair women spied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden suddenly was glorified;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His long-lost Eden was restored again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strange river winding through the plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer was the Arno to his eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Euphrates watering Paradise!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna raised her stately head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with fair words of salutation said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ser Federigo, we come here as friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping in this to make some poor amends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For past unkindness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I who ne'er before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would even cross the threshold of your door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I who in happier days such pride maintained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refused your banquets, and your gifts disdained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning come, a self-invited guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put your generous nature to the test,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breakfast with you under your own vine."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which he answered: "Poor desert of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not your unkindness call it, for if aught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is good in me of feeling or of thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From you it comes, and this last grace outweighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sorrows, all regrets of other days."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after further compliment and talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the asters in the garden walk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left his guests; and to his cottage turned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he entered for a moment yearned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lost splendors of the days of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruby glass, the silver and the gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt how piercing is the sting of pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By want embittered and intensified.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked about him for some means or way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep this unexpected holiday;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searched every cupboard, and then searched again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned the maid, who came, but came in vain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Signor did not hunt to-day," she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's nothing in the house but wine and bread."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly the drowsy falcon shook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His little bells, with that sagacious look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which said, as plain as language to the ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If anything is wanting, I am here!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, everything is wanting, gallant bird!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master seized thee without further word.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like thine own lure, he whirled thee round; ah me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pomp and flutter of brave falconry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells, the jesses, the bright scarlet hood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flight and the pursuit o'er field and wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these forevermore are ended now;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer victor, but the victim thou!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the board a snow-white cloth he spread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid on its wooden dish the loaf of bread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought purple grapes with autumn sunshine hot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragrant peach, the juicy bergamot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the midst a flask of wine he placed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with autumnal flowers the banquet graced.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo, would not these suffice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without thy falcon stuffed with cloves and spice?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all was ready, and the courtly dame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her companion to the cottage came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Ser Federigo's brain there fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild enchantment of a magic spell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room they entered, mean and low and small,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was changed into a sumptuous banquet-hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fanfares by aerial trumpets blown;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rustic chair she sat on was a throne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ate celestial food, and a divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flavor was given to his country wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the poor falcon, fragrant with his spice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A peacock was, or bird of paradise!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the repast was ended, they arose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed again into the garden-close.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the lady, "Far too well I know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering still the days of long ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you betray it not with what surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see me here in this familiar wise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have no children, and you cannot guess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What anguish, what unspeakable distress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mother feels, whose child is lying ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor how her heart anticipates his will.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet for this, you see me lay aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All womanly reserve and check of pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ask the thing most precious in your sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your falcon, your sole comfort and delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which if you find it in your heart to give,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My poor, unhappy boy perchance may live."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo listens, and replies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tears of love and pity in his eyes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas, dear lady! there can be no task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sweet to me, as giving when you ask.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One little hour ago, if I had known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wish of yours, it would have been my own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thinking in what manner I could best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do honor to the presence of my guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deemed that nothing worthier could be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than what most dear and precious was to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so my gallant falcon breathed his last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To furnish forth this morning our repast."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mute contrition, mingled with dismay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle lady tuned her eyes away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grieving that he such sacrifice should make,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kill his falcon for a woman's sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet feeling in her heart a woman's pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nothing she could ask for was denied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then took her leave, and passed out at the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With footstep slow and soul disconsolate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days went by, and lo! a passing-bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolled from the little chapel in the dell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten strokes Ser Federigo heard, and said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing a prayer, "Alas! her child is dead!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months went by; and lo! a merrier chime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang from the chapel bells at Christmas time;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cottage was deserted, and no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo sat beside its door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, with servitors to do his will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the grand villa, half-way up the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat at the Christmas feast, and at his side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna, his beloved bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never so beautiful, so kind, so fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enthroned once more in the old rustic chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-perched upon the back of which there stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of a falcon carved in wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And underneath the inscription, with date,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All things come round to him who will but wait."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as the story reached its end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, over eager to commend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned it with injudicious praise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the voice of blame found vent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fanned the embers of dissent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a somewhat lively blaze.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian shook his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These old Italian tales," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the much-praised Decameron down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the rabble of the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are either trifling, dull, or lewd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gossip of a neighborhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some remote provincial town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scandalous chronicle at best!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to me a stagnant fen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown rank with rushes and with reeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a white lily, now and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blooms in the midst of noxious weeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deadly nightshade on its banks."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this the Student straight replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the white lily, many thanks!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One should not say, with too much pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fountain, I will not drink of thee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor were it grateful to forget,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That from these reservoirs and tanks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even imperial Shakespeare drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Moor of Venice, and the Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Romeo and Juliet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a famous comedy."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a long pause; till some one said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Angel is flying overhead!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At these words spake the Spanish Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmured with an inward breath:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God grant, if what you say be true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be the Angel of Death!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then another pause; and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stroking his beard, he said again:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This brings back to my memory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A story in the Talmud told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That book of gems, that book of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wonders many and manifold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale that often comes to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fills my heart, and haunts my brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never wearies nor grows old."

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days the Evil Spirits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Manitos of mischief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing Hiawatha's wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his love for Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous of their faithful friendship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their noble words and actions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made at length a league against them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To molest them and destroy them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha, wise and wary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often said to Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O my brother! do not leave me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the Evil Spirits harm you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chibiabos, young and heedless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing shook his coal-black tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered ever sweet and childlike,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not fear for me, O brother!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harm and evil come not near me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once when Peboan, the Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roofed with ice the Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the snow-flakes, whirling downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hissed among the withered oak-leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed the pine-trees into wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered all the earth with silence,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with arrows, shod with snow-shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heeding not his brother's warning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing not the Evil Spirits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth to hunt the deer with antlers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone went Chibiabos.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right across the Big-Sea-Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang with speed the deer before him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the wind and snow he followed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the treacherous ice he followed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild with all the fierce commotion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rapture of the hunting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beneath, the Evil Spirits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay in ambush, waiting for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the treacherous ice beneath him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragged him downward to the bottom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried in the sand his body.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unktahee, the god of water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the god of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drowned him in the deep abysses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lake of Gitche Gumee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the headlands Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent forth such a wail of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a fearful lamentation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the bison paused to listen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wolves howled from the prairies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thunder in the distance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting answered "Baim-wawa!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his face with black he painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his robe his head he covered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his wigwam sat lamenting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven long weeks he sat lamenting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttering still this moan of sorrow:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead, the sweet musician!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of all singers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has gone from us forever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has moved a little nearer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Master of all music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Master of all singing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my brother, Chibiabos!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the melancholy fir-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved their dark green fans above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved their purple cones above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing with him to console him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingling with his lamentation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their complaining, their lamenting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Spring, and all the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked in vain for Chibiabos;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed the rivulet, Sebowisha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed the rushes in the meadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tree-tops sang the bluebird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead, the sweet musician!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wigwam sang the robin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead, the sweetest singer!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at night through all the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went the whippoorwill complaining,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wailing went the Wawonaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead, the sweet musician!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of all singers!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Medicine-men, the Medas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians, the Wabenos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to visit Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built a Sacred Lodge beside him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To appease him, to console him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked in silent, grave procession,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing each a pouch of healing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin of beaver, lynx, or otter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with magic roots and simples,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with very potent medicines.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard their steps approaching,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha ceased lamenting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called no more on Chibiabos;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught he questioned, naught he answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his mournful head uncovered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his face the mourning colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washed he slowly and in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly and in silence followed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward to the Sacred Wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There a magic drink they gave him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of Nahma-wusk, the spearmint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Wabeno-wusk, the yarrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roots of power, and herbs of healing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat their drums, and shook their rattles;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanted singly and in chorus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystic songs like these, they chanted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I myself, myself! behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is the great Gray Eagle talking;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, ye white crows, come and hear him!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud-speaking thunder helps me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the unseen spirits help me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hear their voices calling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around the sky I hear them!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can blow you strong, my brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can heal you, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Way-ha-way!" the mystic chorus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends of mine are all the serpents!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear me shake my skin of hen-hawk!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahng, the white loon, I can kill him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can shoot your heart and kill it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can blow you strong, my brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can heal you, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Way-ha-way!" the mystic chorus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I myself, myself! the prophet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I speak the wigwam trembles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes the Sacred Lodge with terror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands unseen begin to shake it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walk, the sky I tread on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bends and makes a noise beneath me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can blow you strong, my brother!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise and speak, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Way-ha-way!" the mystic chorus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they shook their medicine-pouches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the head of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced their medicine-dance around him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upstarting wild and haggard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a man from dreams awakened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was healed of all his madness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the clouds are swept from heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway from his brain departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his moody melancholy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ice is swept from rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway from his heart departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his sorrow and affliction.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they summoned Chibiabos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his grave beneath the waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sands of Gitche Gumee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned Hiawatha's brother.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so mighty was the magic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that cry and invocation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he heard it as he lay there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the Big-Sea-Water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sand he rose and listened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the music and the singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came, obedient to the summons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the doorway of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to enter they forbade him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a chink a coal they gave him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the door a burning fire-brand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruler in the Land of Spirits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruler o'er the dead, they made him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling him a fire to kindle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all those that died thereafter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camp-fires for their night encampments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their solitary journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of the Hereafter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the village of his childhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the homes of those who knew him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing silent through the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a smoke-wreath wafted sideways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly vanished Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he passed, the branches moved not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he trod, the grasses bent not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fallen leaves of last year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made no sound beneath his footstep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four whole days he journeyed onward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the pathway of the dead men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dead-man's strawberry feasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossed the melancholy river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the swinging log he crossed it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came unto the Lake of Silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Stone Canoe was carried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Islands of the Blessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of ghosts and shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that journey, moving slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many weary spirits saw he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panting under heavy burdens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laden with war-clubs, bows and arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robes of fur, and pots and kettles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with food that friends had given
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that solitary journey.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay! why do the living," said they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lay such heavy burdens on us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better were it to go naked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better were it to go fasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to bear such heavy burdens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our long and weary journey!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth then issued Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered eastward, wandered westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching men the use of simples
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the antidotes for poisons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cure of all diseases.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was first made known to mortals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the mystery of Medamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sacred art of healing.

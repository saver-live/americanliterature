<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw, as in a dream sublime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance in the hand of Time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er East and West its beam impended;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And day, with all its hours of light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was slowly sinking out of sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, opposite, the scale of night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently with the stars ascended.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the astrologers of eld,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that bright vision I beheld
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater and deeper mysteries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw, with its celestial keys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its chords of air, its frets of fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Samian's great Aeolian lyre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising through all its sevenfold bars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From earth unto the fixed stars.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the dewy atmosphere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only could I see, but hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its wondrous and harmonious strings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sweet vibration, sphere by sphere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Dian's circle light and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward to vaster and wider rings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, chanting through his beard of snows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majestic, mournful, Saturn goes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the sunless realms of space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverberates the thunder of his bass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the sky's triumphal arch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This music sounded like a march,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with its chorus seemed to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preluding some great tragedy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sirius was rising in the east;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, slow ascending one by one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kindling constellations shone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begirt with many a blazing star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the great giant Algebar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orion, hunter of the beast!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sword hung gleaming by his side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, on his arm, the lion's hide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered across the midnight air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden radiance of its hair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon was pallid, but not faint;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beautiful as some fair saint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serenely moving on her way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hours of trial and dismay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she heard the voice of God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unharmed with naked feet she trod
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the hot and burning stars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on the glowing coals and bars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That were to prove her strength, and try
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her holiness and her purity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus moving on, with silent pace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And triumph in her sweet, pale face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached the station of Orion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aghast he stood in strange alarm!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suddenly from his outstretched arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down fell the red skin of the lion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the river at his feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mighty club no longer beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forehead of the bull; but he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reeled as of yore beside the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, blinded by Oenopion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sought the blacksmith at his forge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, climbing up the mountain gorge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed his blank eyes upon the sun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, through the silence overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel with a trumpet said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forevermore, forevermore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reign of violence is o'er!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like an instrument that flings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its music on another's strings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trumpet of the angel cast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the heavenly lyre its blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on from sphere to sphere the words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-echoed down the burning chords,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forevermore, forevermore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reign of violence is o'er!"

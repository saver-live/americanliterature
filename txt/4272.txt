&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can death be sleep, when life is but a dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scenes of bliss pass as a phantom by?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transient pleasures as a vision seem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet we think the greatest pain's to die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strange it is that man on earth should roam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lead a life of woe, but not forsake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His rugged path; nor dare he view alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His future doom which is but to awake.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward on the high-hilled plains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where for me the world began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I think, in newer veins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frets the changeless blood of man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that other lads than I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strip to bathe on Severn shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, no help, for all they try,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tread the mill I trod before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, when hueless is the west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the darkness hushes wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the lad lies down to rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands the troubled dream beside.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, on thoughts that once were mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day looks down the eastern steep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the youth at morning shine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes the vow he will not keep.

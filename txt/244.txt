<p>I won't beg for your love.<br> It's safely laid aside….<br> I won't be penning jealous<br> Letters to your bride.<br> But be wise, take my advice:<br> Give her my poems to read,<br> Give her my photos beside –<br> Be kind to the newly-wed!<br> Oh, knowledge is better for geese,<br> Feeling they've won completely,<br> Than sweet companionable speech,<br> Or a tender first-night memory…<br> And when you've spent all your<br> Kopecks of joy with your dear friend,<br> And your spirit's sated with it all,<br> And suddenly you're ashamed –<br> Don't come – I'll fail to know you –<br> To me, night's crestfallen guest.<br> For how could I help you?<br> I've no cure for happiness.<br></p>

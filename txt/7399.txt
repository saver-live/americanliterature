  And what are you that, wanting you
    I should be kept awake
  As many nights as there are days
    With weeping for your sake?
  And what are you that, missing you,
    As many days as crawl
  I should be listening to the wind
    And looking at the wall?
  I know a man that's a braver man
    And twenty men as kind,
  And what are you, that you should be
    The one man in my mind?
  Yet women's ways are witless ways,
    As any sage will tell,â€”
  And what am I, that I should love
    So wisely and so well?

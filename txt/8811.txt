<p>ON a sheer peak of joy we meet;<br> Below us hums the abyss;<br> Death either way allures our feet<br> If we take one step amiss.<br> <br> One moment let us drink the blue<br> Transcendent air together--<br> Then down where the same old work's to do<br> In the same dull daily weather.<br> <br> We may not wait . . . yet look below!<br> How part? On this keen ridge<br> But one may pass. They call you--go!<br> My life shall be your bridge.</p>

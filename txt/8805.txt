<p>WHERE suns chase suns in rhythmic dance,<br> Where seeds are springing from the dust,<br> Where mind sways mind with spirit-glance,<br> High court is held, and law is just.<br> <br> No hill alone, a sovereign bar;<br> Through space the fiery sparks are whirled<br> That draw and cling, and shape a star, --<br> That burn and cool, and form a world<br> <br> Whose hidden forces hear a voice<br> That leads them by a perfect plan:<br> "Obey," it cries, "with steadfast choice,<br> Law shall complete what law began.<br> <br> "Refuse, -- behold the broken arc,<br> The sky of all its stars despoiled;<br> The new germ smothered in the dark,<br> The snow-pure soul with sin assoiled."<br> <br> The voice still saith, "While atoms weave<br> Both world and soul for utmost joy,<br> Who sins must suffer, -- no reprieve;<br> The law that quickens must destroy."</p>

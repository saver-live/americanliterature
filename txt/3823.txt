<p><cite class="al-title">The Mule-Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life in Three Acts</cite> was co-authored by Hughes and <a href="/author/nora-zeale-hurston">Nora Zeale Hurston</a>. Published in 1931, the play was not staged until sixty years later, at the Barrymore Theatre on Broadway in New York <i>[movie poster, right]</i>. Apparently, the writers' collaboration did not bode well for their relationship, resulting in their break-up. The remainder of the second and third Acts are not yet available in the public domain.</p><p><a href="characters">Characters</a></p><p><a href="act-one">Act One</a></p><p><a href="act-two-scene-one">Act Two - Scene One</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/langston-hughes">Langston Hughes</a> library. </p>

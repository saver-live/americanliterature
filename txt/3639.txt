<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was one-and-twenty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard a wise man say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give crowns and pounds and guineas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not your heart away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give pearls away and rubies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But keep your fancy free."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was one-and-twenty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No use to talk to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was one-and-twenty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard him say again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heart out of the bosom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was never given in vain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis paid with sighs a plenty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sold for endless rue."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am two-and-twenty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West and away the wheels of darkness roll,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days beamy banner up the east is borne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spectres and fears, the nightmare and her foal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drown in the golden deluge of the morn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But over sea and continent from sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe to the Indies has the earth conveyed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast and moon-eclipsing cone of night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her towering foolscap of eternal shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, in mid heaven the sun is mounted; hark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belfries tingle to the noonday chime.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis silent, and the subterranean dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has crossed the nadir, and begins to climb.

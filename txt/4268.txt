<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round many western islands have I been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a new planet swims into his ken;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He star'd at the Pacific, and all his men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look'd at each other with a wild surmise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A one-legged, one-armed, one-eyed man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bundle of rags upon a crutch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stumbled on windy Cruachan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursing the wind. It was as much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the one sturdy leg could do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep him upright while he cursed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had counted, where long years ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Maeves nine Maines had been nursed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of lapwings, one old sheep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a house to the plains edge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When close to his right hand a heap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of grey stones and a rocky ledge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminded him that he could make,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he but shifted a few stones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shelter till the daylight broke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while he fumbled with the stones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They toppled over; Were it not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a lucky wooden shin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been hurt; and toppling brought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his eyes, where stones had been,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark deep hole in the rocks face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave a gasp and thought to run,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being certain it was no right place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Hell Mouth at Cruachan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thats stuffed with all thats old and bad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet stood still, because inside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had seen a red-haired jolly lad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some outlandish coat beside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ladle and a tub of beer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plainly no phantom by his look.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with a laugh at his own fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crawled into that pleasant nook.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Red-head stretched himself to yawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmured, May God curse the night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thats grown uneasy near the dawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that it seems even I sleep light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who are you that wakens me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has one of Maeves nine brawling sons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown tired of his own company?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let him keep his grave for once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to find the sleep I have lost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then at last being wide awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took you for a brawling ghost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say what you please, but from daybreak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill sleep another century.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggar deaf to all but hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went down upon a hand and knee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took the wooden ladle up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would have dipped it in the beer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other pushed his hand aside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you have dipped it in the beer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sacred Goban brewed, he cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Id have assurance that you are able
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To value beer, I will have no fool
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dipping his nose into my ladle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has stumbled on this hole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bad hour before the dawn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you but drink that beer and say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will sleep until the winters gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maybe, to Midsummer Day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will sleep that length; and at the first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waited so for that or this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the weather was a-cursed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I had no woman there to kiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slept for half a year or so;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But year by year I found that less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave me such pleasure Id forgo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a half hours nothingness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when at one years end I found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not waked a single minute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose this burrow under ground.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will sleep away all Time within it:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sleep were now nine centuries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for those mornings when I find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lapwing at their foolish cries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sheep bleating at the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when I also played the fool.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggar in a rage began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his hunkers in the hole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its plain that you are no right man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mock at everything I love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it were not worth the doing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Id have a merry life enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a good Easter wind were blowing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though the winter wind is bad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should not be too down in the mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For anything you did or said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If but this wind were in the south.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other cried, You long for spring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that the wind would shift a point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not know that you would bring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If time were suppler in the joint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the spring nor the south wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the hour when you shall pass away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave no smoking wick behind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all life longs for the Last Day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And theres no man but cocks his ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know when Michaels trumpet cries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flesh and bone may disappear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And souls as if they were but sighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there be nothing but God left;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I alone being blessed keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some old rabbit to my cleft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wait Him in a drunken sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dipped his ladle in the tub
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drank and yawned and stretched him out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other shouted, You would rob
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life of every pleasant thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every comfortable thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so take that and that. Thereon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave him a great pummelling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But might have pummelled at a stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the sleeper knew or cared;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after heaped the stones again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cursed and prayed, and prayed and cursed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh God if he got loose! And then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fury and in panic fled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Hell Mouth at Cruachan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave God thanks that overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds were brightening with the dawn.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three old hermits took the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a cold and desolate sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First was muttering a prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second rummaged for a flea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a windy stone, the third,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giddy with his hundredth year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang unnoticed like a bird.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Door of Death is near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what waits behind the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times in a single day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, though upright on the shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall asleep when I should pray.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first but now the second,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were but given what we have earned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all thoughts and deeds are reckoned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So its plain to be discerned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the shades of holy men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have failed being weak of will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass the Door of Birth again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are plagued by crowds, until
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theyve the passion to escape.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moaned the other, They are thrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into some most fearful shape.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the second mocked his moan:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not changed to anything,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having loved God once, but maybe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a poet or a king
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a witty lovely lady.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While hed rummaged rags and hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught and cracked his flea, the third,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giddy with his hundredth year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang unnoticed like a bird.

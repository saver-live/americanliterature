<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Hermes once took to his feathers light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lulled Argus, baffled, swooned and slept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on a Delphic reed, my idle spright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So played, so charmed, so conquered, so bereft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing it asleep, so fled away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor unto Tempe, where Jove grieved a day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to that second circle of sad Hell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale were the lips I kissed, and fair the form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I floated with, about that melancholy storm.

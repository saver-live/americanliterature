<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time of year a twelvemonth past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fred and I would meet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We needs must jangle, till at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fought and I was beat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then the summer fields about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till rainy days began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose Harland on her Sundays out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked with the better man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better man she walks with still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though now 'tis not with Fred:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lad that lives and has his will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is worth a dozen dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred keeps the house all kinds of weather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clay's the house he keeps;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rose and I walk out together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock-still lies Fred and sleeps.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder see the morning blink:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is up, and up must I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wash and dress and eat and drink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look at things and talk and think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And work, and God knows why.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh often have I washed and dressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whats to show for all my pain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me lie abed and rest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten thousand times Ive done my best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And alls to do again.

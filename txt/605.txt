<p>I met Du Fu on a mountaintop<br> in August when the sun was hot.<br> <br> Under the shade of his big straw hat<br> his face was sad--<br> <br> in the years since we last parted,<br> he'd grown wan, exhausted.<br> <br> Poor old Du Fu, I thought then,<br> he must be agonizing over poetry again.<br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that look of Christ might seem to say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thou Peter! art thou then a common stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which I at last must break my heart upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all God's charge to his high angels may
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guard my foot better? Did I yesterday
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash thy feet, my beloved, that they should run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick to deny me 'neath the morning sun?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do thy kisses, like the rest, betray?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cock crows coldly. Go, and manifest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A late contrition, but no bootless fear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when thy final need is dreariest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not be denied, as I am here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My voice to God and angels shall attest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I know this man, let him be clear.'
</pre>

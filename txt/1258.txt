<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With stammering lips and insufficient sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strive and struggle to deliver right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That music of my nature, day and night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dream and thought and feeling interwound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And inly answering all the senses round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With octaves of a mystic depth and height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which step out grandly to the infinite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the dark edges of the sensual ground.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This song of soul I struggle to outbear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through portals of the sense, sublime and whole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And utter all myself into the air:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I did it, as the thunder-roll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks its own cloud, my flesh would perish there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that dread apocalypse of soul.

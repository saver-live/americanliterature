<p>I'm lyin' on the barren ground that's baked and cracked with drought,<br> And dunno if my legs or back or heart is most wore out;<br> I've got no spirits left to rise and smooth me achin' brow —<br> I'm too knocked up to light a fire and bile the billy now.<br></p>
<p>Oh it's trampin', trampin', tra-a-mpin', in flies an' dust an' heat,<br> Or it's trampin' trampin' tra-a-a-mpin'<br> through mud and slush 'n sleet;<br> It's tramp an' tramp for tucker—one everlastin' strife,<br> An' wearin' out yer boots an' heart in the wastin' of yer life.<br></p>
<p>They whine o' lost an' wasted lives in idleness and crime —<br> I've wasted mine for twenty years, and grafted all the time<br> And never drunk the stuff I earned, nor gambled when I shore —<br> But somehow when yer on the track yer life seems wasted more.<br></p>
<p>A long dry stretch of thirty miles I've tramped this broilin' day,<br> All for the off-chance of a job a hundred miles away;<br> There's twenty hungry beggars wild for any job this year,<br> An' fifty might be at the shed while I am lyin' here.<br></p>
<p>The sinews in my legs seem drawn, red-hot—'n that's the truth;<br> I seem to weigh a ton, and ache like one tremendous tooth;<br> I'm stung between my shoulder-blades—my blessed back seems broke;<br> I'm too knocked out to eat a bite—I'm too knocked up to smoke.<br></p>
<p>The blessed rain is comin' too—there's oceans in the sky,<br> An' I suppose I must get up and rig the blessed fly;<br> The heat is bad, the water's bad, the flies a crimson curse,<br> The grub is bad, mosquitoes damned—but rheumatism's worse.<br></p>
<p>I wonder why poor blokes like me will stick so fast ter breath,<br> Though Shakespeare says it is the fear of somethin' after death;<br> But though Eternity be cursed with God's almighty curse —<br> What ever that same somethin' is I swear it can't be worse.<br></p>
<p>For it's trampin', trampin', tra-a-mpin' thro' hell across the plain,<br> And it's trampin' trampin' tra-a-mpin' thro' slush 'n mud 'n rain —<br> A livin' worse than any dog—without a home 'n wife,<br> A-wearin' out yer heart 'n soul in the wastin' of yer life.<br></p>

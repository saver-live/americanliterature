<p>Everything's looted, betrayed and traded,<br> Black death's wing's overhead.<br> Everything's eaten by hunger, un-sated,<br> So why does a light shine ahead?<br> <br> By day, a mysterious wood, near the town,<br> Breathes out cherry, a cherry perfume.<br> By night, on July's sky, deep, and transparent,<br> New constellations are thrown.<br> <br> And something miraculous will come<br> Close to the darkness and ruin,<br> Something no-one, no-one, has known,<br> Though we've longed for it since we were children.<br></p>

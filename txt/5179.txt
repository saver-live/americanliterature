<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a horse to tame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a gun to handle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God knows you can enter the game
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If youll only pay for the same,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the price of the game is a candle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single flickering candle!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JANUARY (Hunting)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certes, it is a noble sport,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men have quitted selle and swum fort.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am of the meeker sort
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I prefer Surtees in comfort.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach me my Handley Cross again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My run, where never danger lurks, is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Jorrocks and his deathless train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigg, Binjimin, and Artexerxes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FEBRUARY (Coursing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most men harry the world for fun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each man seeks it a different way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of all daft devils under the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greyhounds the daftest says Jorrocks J.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MARCH (Racing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse is ridden, the jockey rides,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backers back, the owners own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But . . . there are lots of things beside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I should let this game alone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APRIL (Rowing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope of Rome he could not win
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From pleasant meats and pleasant sin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These who, replying not, submit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the curses of the pit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which that stern coach (oh, greater shame)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flings forth by number not by name.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Triple Crown or Jesuits oath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do what one wrathful trainer doth?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAY (Fishing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold a parable. A fished for B
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C took her bait; her heart being set on D.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank heaven who cooled your blood and cramped your wishes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men and not Gods torment you, little fishes!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JUNE (Cricket)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God who made the British Isles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taught me how to play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not worship crocodiles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or bow the knee to clay!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me a willow wand and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hide and cork and twine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From century to century
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will gambol round my shrine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JULY (Archery)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child of the Nineties considers with laughter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid whom his sire in the Sixties ran after,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While careering himself in pursuit of a girl whom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Twenties will dub a last century heirloom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUGUST (Coaching)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pious Horse to church may trot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid may work a mans salvation . . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four horses and a girl are not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, roads to reformation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEPTEMBER (Shooting)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace upon Earth, Goodwill to men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So greet we Christmas Day!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Christian, load your gun and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Christian, out and slay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OCTOBER (Golf)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Golf is art and art is Golf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not far to seek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much depends upon the lie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much upon the cleek.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOVEMBER (Boxing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read here the moral roundly writ
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him who into battle goes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each soul that hitting hard or hit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endureth gross or ghostly foes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince, blown by many overthrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half blind with shame, half choked with dirt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man cannot tell, but Allah knows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much the other side was hurt!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DECEMBER (Skating)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the ice she flies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect and poised and fair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars in my true-loves eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me to do and dare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now will I fly as she flies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe for the stars that misled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars I beheld in her eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now do I see in my head!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we must come away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That are you out of pocket ?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry to spoil your play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But somebody says we must pay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the candles down to the socket,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its horrible tallowy socket

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother dandled me and sang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How young it is, how young!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a golden cradle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That on a willow swung.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went away, my mother sang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was brought to bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the while her needle pulled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold and silver thread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled the thread and bit the thread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a golden gown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wept because she had dreamt that I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was born to wear a crown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was got, my mother sang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard a sea-mew cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw a flake of the yellow foam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dropped upon my thigh.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How therefore could she help but braid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold into my hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream that I should carry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden top of care?

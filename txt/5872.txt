&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you ask me, whence these stories?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence these legends and traditions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the odors of the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dew and damp of meadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the curling smoke of wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rushing of great rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their frequent repetitions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their wild reverberations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of thunder in the mountains?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should answer, I should tell you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the forests and the prairies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the great lakes of the Northland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Ojibways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mountains, moors, and fen-lands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeds among the reeds and rushes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat them as I heard them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lips of Nawadaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musician, the sweet singer."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you ask where Nawadaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found these songs so wild and wayward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found these legends and traditions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should answer, I should tell you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the bird's-nests of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lodges of the beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hoof-prints of the bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyry of the eagle!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the wild-fowl sang them to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moorlands and the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the melancholy marshes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chetowaik, the plover, sang them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahng, the loon, the wild-goose, Wawa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grouse, the Mushkodasa!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If still further you should ask me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Who was Nawadaha?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us of this Nawadaha,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should answer your inquiries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway in such words as follow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the vale of Tawasentha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the green and silent valley,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the pleasant water-courses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelt the singer Nawadaha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about the Indian village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the meadows and the corn-fields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beyond them stood the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the groves of singing pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green in Summer, white in Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever sighing, ever singing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the pleasant water-courses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could trace them through the valley,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the rushing in the Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the alders in the Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the white fog in the Autumn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the black line in the Winter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beside them dwelt the singer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vale of Tawasentha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the green and silent valley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There he sang of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the Song of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his wondrous birth and being,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he prayed and how he fasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he lived, and toiled, and suffered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the tribes of men might prosper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he might advance his people!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who love the haunts of Nature,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love the sunshine of the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love the shadow of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love the wind among the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rain-shower and the snow-storm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rushing of great rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through their palisades of pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thunder in the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose innumerable echoes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flap like eagles in their eyries;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to these wild traditions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this Song of Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who love a nation's legends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love the ballads of a people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like voices from afar off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call to us to pause and listen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak in tones so plain and childlike,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely can the ear distinguish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they are sung or spoken;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to this Indian Legend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this Song of Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have faith in God and Nature,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who believe that in all ages
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every human heart is human,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in even savage bosoms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are longings, yearnings, strivings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the good they comprehend not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feeble hands and helpless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groping blindly in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch God's right hand in that darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are lifted up and strengthened;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to this simple story,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this Song of Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye, who sometimes, in your rambles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the green lanes of the country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the tangled barberry-bushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang their tufts of crimson berries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over stone walls gray with mosses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause by some neglected graveyard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while to muse, and ponder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a half-effaced inscription,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written with little skill of song-craft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homely phrases, but each letter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of hope and yet of heart-break,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of all the tender pathos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Here and the Hereafter;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay and read this rude inscription,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read this Song of Hiawatha!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE PEACE-PIPE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Mountains of the Prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the Master of Life, descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the red crags of the quarry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood erect, and called the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called the tribes of men together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his footprints flowed a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped into the light of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the precipice plunging downward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Spirit, stooping earthward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his finger on the meadow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traced a winding pathway for it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying to it, "Run in this way!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the red stone of the quarry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hand he broke a fragment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moulded it into a pipe-head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaped and fashioned it with figures;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the margin of the river
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took a long reed for a pipe-stem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its dark green leaves upon it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the pipe with bark of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bark of the red willow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed upon the neighboring forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made its great boughs chafe together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in flame they burst and kindled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And erect upon the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoked the calumet, the Peace-Pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a signal to the nations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the smoke rose slowly, slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the tranquil air of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a single line of darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a denser, bluer vapor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a snow-white cloud unfolding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the tree-tops of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever rising, rising, rising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it touched the top of heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it broke against the heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rolled outward all around it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Vale of Tawasentha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Valley of Wyoming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the groves of Tuscaloosa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the far-off Rocky Mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Northern lakes and rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the tribes beheld the signal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the distant smoke ascending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Prophets of the nations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said: "Behold it, the Pukwana!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending like a wand of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waving like a hand that beckons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls the tribes of men together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls the warriors to his council!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the rivers, o'er the prairies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the warriors of the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Delawares and Mohawks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Choctaws and Camanches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Shoshonies and Blackfeet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Pawnees and Omahas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Mandans and Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Hurons and Ojibways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the warriors drawn together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Mountains of the Prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they stood there on the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their weapons and their war-gear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted like the leaves of Autumn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted like the sky of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildly glaring at each other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their faces stern defiance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their hearts the feuds of ages,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hereditary hatred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancestral thirst of vengeance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creator of the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked upon them with compassion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With paternal love and pity;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked upon their wrath and wrangling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as quarrels among children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as feuds and fights of children!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them he stretched his right hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To subdue their stubborn natures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allay their thirst and fever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shadow of his right hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake to them with voice majestic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sound of far-off waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling into deep abysses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning, chiding, spake in this wise:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O my children! my poor children!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the words of wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the words of warning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lips of the Great Spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Master of Life, who made you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have given you lands to hunt in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given you streams to fish in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given you bear and bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given you roe and reindeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given you brant and beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the marshes full of wild-fowl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the rivers full of fishes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then are you not contented?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then will you hunt each other?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am weary of your quarrels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary of your wars and bloodshed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary of your prayers for vengeance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your wranglings and dissensions;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your strength is in your union,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your danger is in discord;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore be at peace henceforward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as brothers live together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will send a Prophet to you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Deliverer of the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall guide you and shall teach you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall toil and suffer with you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you listen to his counsels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will multiply and prosper;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his warnings pass unheeded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will fade away and perish!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bathe now in the stream before you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash the war-paint from your faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash the blood-stains from your fingers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bury your war-clubs and your weapons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break the red stone from this quarry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the reeds that grow beside you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deck them with your brightest feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke the calumet together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as brothers live henceforward!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then upon the ground the warriors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw their cloaks and shirts of deer-skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw their weapons and their war-gear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped into the rushing river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washed the war-paint from their faces.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear above them flowed the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear and limpid from the footprints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Master of Life descending;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark below them flowed the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if blood were mingled with it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the river came the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean and washed from all their war-paint;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the banks their clubs they buried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried all their warlike weapons.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Spirit, the creator,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled upon his helpless children!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in silence all the warriors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the red stone of the quarry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoothed and formed it into Peace-Pipes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the long reeds by the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decked them with their brightest feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And departed each one homeward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Master of Life, ascending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the opening of cloud-curtains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the doorways of the heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished from before their faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smoke that rolled around him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four Winds

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor be to Mudjekeewis!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried the warriors, cried the old men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came in triumph homeward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sacred Belt of Wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the regions of the North-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the kingdom of Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the White Rabbit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had stolen the Belt of Wampum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the neck of Mishe-Mokwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Great Bear of the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the terror of the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he lay asleep and cumbrous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the summit of the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a rock with mosses on it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spotted brown and gray with mosses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently he stole upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the red nails of the monster
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost touched him, almost scared him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the hot breath of his nostrils
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he drew the Belt of Wampum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the round ears, that heard not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the small eyes, that saw not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the long nose and nostrils,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black muffle of the nostrils,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of which the heavy breathing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he swung aloft his war-club,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted loud and long his war-cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote the mighty Mishe-Mokwa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right between the eyes he smote him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the heavy blow bewildered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the Great Bear of the mountains;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his knees beneath him trembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he whimpered like a woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he reeled and staggered forward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sat upon his haunches;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing fearlessly before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taunted him in loud derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake disdainfully in this wise:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hark you, Bear! you are a coward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no Brave, as you pretended;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else you would not cry and whimper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a miserable woman!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear! you know our tribes are hostile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long have been at war together;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you find that we are strongest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You go sneaking in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You go hiding in the mountains!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had you conquered me in battle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a groan would I have uttered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you, Bear! sit here and whimper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And disgrace your tribe by crying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wretched Shaugodaya,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a cowardly old woman!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again he raised his war-club,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote again the Mishe-Mokwa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of his forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke his skull, as ice is broken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one goes to fish in Winter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was slain the Mishe-Mokwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the Great Bear of the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the terror of the nations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor be to Mudjekeewis!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a shout exclaimed the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor be to Mudjekeewis!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth he shall be the West-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hereafter and forever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall he hold supreme dominion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over all the winds of heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call him no more Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call him Kabeyun, the West-Wind!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was Mudjekeewis chosen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father of the Winds of Heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For himself he kept the West-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave the others to his children;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto Wabun gave the East-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave the South to Shawondasee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the North-Wind, wild and cruel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fierce Kabibonokka.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young and beautiful was Wabun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who brought the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was whose silver arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chased the dark o'er hill and valley;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was whose cheeks were painted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the brightest streaks of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whose voice awoke the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called the deer, and called the hunter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely in the sky was Wabun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the birds sang gayly to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the wild-flowers of the meadow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the air with odors for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the forests and the rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang and shouted at his coming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still his heart was sad within him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he was alone in heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one morning, gazing earthward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the village still was sleeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fog lay on the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a ghost, that goes at sunrise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beheld a maiden walking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone upon a meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering water-flags and rushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a river in the meadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every morning, gazing earthward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the first thing he beheld there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was her blue eyes looking at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two blue lakes among the rushes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he loved the lonely maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thus waited for his coming;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they both were solitary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She on earth and he in heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he wooed her with caresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wooed her with his smile of sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his flattering words he wooed her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his sighing and his singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentlest whispers in the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softest music, sweetest odors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he drew her to his bosom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folded in his robes of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till into a star he changed her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling still upon his bosom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forever in the heavens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are seen together walking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wabun and the Wabun-Annung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wabun and the Star of Morning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fierce Kabibonokka
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had his dwelling among icebergs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the everlasting snow-drifts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kingdom of Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the White Rabbit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was whose hand in Autumn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted all the trees with scarlet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stained the leaves with red and yellow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who sent the snow-flake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sifting, hissing through the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froze the ponds, the lakes, the rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove the loon and sea-gull southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove the cormorant and curlew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their nests of sedge and sea-tang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the realms of Shawondasee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the fierce Kabibonokka
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issued from his lodge of snow-drifts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his home among the icebergs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his hair, with snow besprinkled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamed behind him like a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a black and wintry river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he howled and hurried southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over frozen lakes and moorlands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There among the reeds and rushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found he Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trailing strings of fish behind him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the frozen fens and moorlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingering still among the moorlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though his tribe had long departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of Shawondasee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried the fierce Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is this that dares to brave me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dares to stay in my dominions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Wawa has departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wild-goose has gone southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago departed southward?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go into his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put his smouldering fire out!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at night Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the lodge came wild and wailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaped the snow in drifts about it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted down into the smoke-flue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook the lodge-poles in his fury,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flapped the curtain of the door-way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shingebis, the diver, feared not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shingebis, the diver, cared not;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four great logs had he for firewood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One for each moon of the winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for food the fishes served him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his blazing fire he sat there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm and merry, eating, laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing, "O Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are but my fellow-mortal!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Kabibonokka entered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt his presence by the coldness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt his icy breath upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still he did not cease his singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still he did not leave his laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only turned the log a little,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only made the fire burn brighter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the sparks fly up the smoke-flue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Kabibonokka's forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his snow-besprinkled tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drops of sweat fell fast and heavy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making dints upon the ashes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As along the eaves of lodges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from drooping boughs of hemlock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drips the melting snow in spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making hollows in the snow-drifts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at last he rose defeated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not bear the heat and laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not bear the merry singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rushed headlong through the door-way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamped upon the crusted snow-drifts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamped upon the lakes and rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the snow upon them harder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the ice upon them thicker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenged Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come forth and wrestle with him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come forth and wrestle naked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the frozen fens and moorlands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth went Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrestled all night with the North-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrestled naked on the moorlands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fierce Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his panting breath grew fainter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his frozen grasp grew feebler,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he reeled and staggered backward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And retreated, baffled, beaten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kingdom of Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of the White Rabbit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing still the gusty laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing, "O Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are but my fellow-mortal!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawondasee, fat and lazy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had his dwelling far to southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the drowsy, dreamy sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the never-ending Summer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who sent the wood-birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the Shawshaw, sent the swallow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the wild-goose, Wawa, northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the melons and tobacco,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grapes in purple clusters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his pipe the smoke ascending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the sky with haze and vapor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the air with dreamy softness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave a twinkle to the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched the rugged hills with smoothness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the tender Indian Summer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the melancholy north-land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dreary Moon of Snow-shoes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listless, careless Shawondasee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his life he had one shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart one sorrow had he.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, as he was gazing northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far away upon a prairie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beheld a maiden standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw a tall and slender maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone upon a prairie;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brightest green were all her garments,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her hair was like the sunshine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day he gazed upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day he sighed with passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day his heart within him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew more hot with love and longing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the maid with yellow tresses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was too fat and lazy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bestir himself and woo her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, too indolent and easy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pursue her and persuade her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he only gazed upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only sat and sighed with passion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the maiden of the prairie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till one morning, looking northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beheld her yellow tresses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed and covered o'er with whiteness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered as with whitest snow-flakes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! my brother from the North-land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the kingdom of Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the White Rabbit!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have stolen the maiden from me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have laid your hand upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have wooed and won my maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your stories of the North-land!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the wretched Shawondasee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed into the air his sorrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the South-Wind o'er the prairie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered warm with sighs of passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sighs of Shawondasee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the air seemed full of snow-flakes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of thistle-down the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maid with hair like sunshine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished from his sight forever;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never more did Shawondasee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the maid with yellow tresses!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor, deluded Shawondasee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was no woman that you gazed at,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was no maiden that you sighed for,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the prairie dandelion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That through all the dreamy Summer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had gazed at with such longing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had sighed for with such passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had puffed away forever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown into the air with sighing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! deluded Shawondasee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Four Winds were divided;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had their stations in the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corners of the heavens;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For himself the West-Wind only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA'S CHILDHOOD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward through the evening twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days that are forgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unremembered ages,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the full moon fell Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the beautiful Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She a wife, but not a mother.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was sporting with her women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swinging in a swing of grape-vines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When her rival, the rejected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of jealousy and hatred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut the leafy swing asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut in twain the twisted grape-vines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nokomis fell affrighted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward through the evening twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Muskoday, the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the prairie full of blossoms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See! a star falls!" said the people;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the sky a star is falling!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There among the ferns and mosses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There among the prairie lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Muskoday, the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moonlight and the starlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Nokomis bore a daughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she called her name Wenonah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first-born of her daughters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the daughter of Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew up like the prairie lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew a tall and slender maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beauty of the moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beauty of the starlight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nokomis warned her often,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying oft, and oft repeating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, beware of Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the West-Wind, Mudjekeewis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen not to what he tells you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie not down upon the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoop not down among the lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the West-Wind come and harm you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she heeded not the warning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heeded not those words of wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the West-Wind came at evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking lightly o'er the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispering to the leaves and blossoms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending low the flowers and grasses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the beautiful Wenonah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying there among the lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wooed her with his words of sweetness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wooed her with his soft caresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till she bore a son in sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore a son of love and sorrow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was born my Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was born the child of wonder;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the daughter of Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha's gentle mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her anguish died deserted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the West-Wind, false and faithless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the heartless Mudjekeewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her daughter long and loudly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wailed and wept the sad Nokomis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh that I were dead!" she murmured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh that I were dead, as thou art!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more work, and no more weeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahonowin!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahonowin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shores of Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shining Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark behind it rose the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the firs with cones upon them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright before it beat the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat the clear and sunny water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the wrinkled old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nursed the little Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocked him in his linden cradle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedded soft in moss and rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safely bound with reindeer sinews;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stilled his fretful wail by saying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lulled him into slumber, singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ewa-yea! my little owlet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is this, that lights the wigwam?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his great eyes lights the wigwam?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ewa-yea! my little owlet!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things Nokomis taught him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the stars that shine in heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flaring far away to northward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the frosty nights of Winter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed the broad white road in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running straight across the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door on summer evenings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the little Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the lapping of the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds of music, words of wonder;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Minne-wawa!" said the Pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mudway-aushka!" said the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitting through the dusk of evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the twinkle of its candle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting up the brakes and bushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he sang the song of children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the song Nokomis taught him:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little, flitting, white-fire insect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little, dancing, white-fire creature,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light me with your little candle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere upon my bed I lay me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the moon rise from the water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rippling, rounding from the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the flecks and shadows on it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good Nokomis answered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once a warrior, very angry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized his grandmother, and threw her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up into the sky at midnight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right against the moon he threw her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is her body that you see there."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the rainbow in the heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eastern sky, the rainbow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good Nokomis answered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the heaven of flowers you see there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wild-flowers of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the lilies of the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on earth they fade and perish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossom in that heaven above us."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the owls at midnight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hooting, laughing in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" he cried in terror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that," he said, "Nokomis?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good Nokomis answered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is but the owl and owlet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking in their native language,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking, scolding at each other."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the little Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned of every bird its language,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned their names and all their secrets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they built their nests in Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they hid themselves in Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talked with them whene'er he met them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called them "Hiawatha's Chickens."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all beasts he learned the language,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned their names and all their secrets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the beavers built their lodges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the squirrels hid their acorns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the reindeer ran so swiftly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the rabbit was so timid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talked with them whene'er he met them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called them "Hiawatha's Brothers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Iagoo, the great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the marvellous story-teller,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the traveller and the talker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the friend of old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a bow for Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a branch of ash he made it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an oak-bough made the arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tipped with flint, and winged with feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cord he made of deer-skin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said to Hiawatha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, my son, into the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the red deer herd together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill for us a famous roebuck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill for us a deer with antlers!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into the forest straightway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone walked Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proudly, with his bow and arrows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the birds sang round him, o'er him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the oak-tree, close beside him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out among the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed, and said between his laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rabbit from his pathway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped aside, and at a distance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat erect upon his haunches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half in fear and half in frolic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying to the little hunter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he heeded not, nor heard them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his thoughts were with the red deer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their tracks his eyes were fastened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading downward to the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ford across the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as one in slumber walked he.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden in the alder-bushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he waited till the deer came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he saw two antlers lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw two eyes look from the thicket,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw two nostrils point to windward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a deer came down the pathway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flecked with leafy light and shadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heart within him fluttered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembled like the leaves above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the birch-leaf palpitated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the deer came down the pathway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, upon one knee uprising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha aimed an arrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce a twig moved with his motion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wary roebuck started,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamped with all his hoofs together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened with one foot uplifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped as if to meet the arrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! the singing, fatal arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead he lay there in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the ford across the river;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat his timid heart no longer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the heart of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throbbed and shouted and exulted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he bore the red deer homeward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iagoo and Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailed his coming with applauses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the red deer's hide Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a cloak for Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the red deer's flesh Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a banquet to his honor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the village came and feasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the guests praised Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called him Strong-Heart, Soan-ge-taha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of childhood into manhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now had grown my Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skilled in all the craft of hunters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned in all the lore of old men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all youthful sports and pastimes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all manly arts and labors.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift of foot was Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could shoot an arrow from him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And run forward with such fleetness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the arrow fell behind him!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong of arm was Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could shoot ten arrows upward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoot them with such strength and swiftness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the tenth had left the bow-string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the first to earth had fallen!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic mittens made of deer-skin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When upon his hands he wore them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could smite the rocks asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could grind them into powder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had moccasins enchanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic moccasins of deer-skin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he bound them round his ankles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When upon his feet he tied them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each stride a mile he measured!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much he questioned old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his father Mudjekeewis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned from her the fatal secret
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the beauty of his mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the falsehood of his father;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heart was hot within him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a living coal his heart was.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said to old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go to Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See how fares it with my father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorways of the West-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the portals of the Sunset!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his lodge went Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed for travel, armed for hunting;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed in deer-skin shirt and leggings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richly wrought with quills and wampum;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his head his eagle-feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round his waist his belt of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his hand his bow of ash-wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strung with sinews of the reindeer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his quiver oaken arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tipped with jasper, winged with feathers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his moccasins enchanted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning said the old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go not forth, O Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kingdom of the West-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the realms of Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest he harm you with his magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest he kill you with his cunning!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fearless Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heeded not her woman's warning;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth he strode into the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each stride a mile he measured;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lurid seemed the sky above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lurid seemed the earth beneath him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot and close the air around him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with smoke and fiery vapors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of burning woods and prairies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his heart was hot within him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a living coal his heart was.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he journeyed westward, westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left the fleetest deer behind him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left the antelope and bison;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossed the rushing Esconaba,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossed the mighty Mississippi,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed the Mountains of the Prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed the land of Crows and Foxes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed the dwellings of the Blackfeet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came unto the Rocky Mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kingdom of the West-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where upon the gusty summits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruler of the winds of heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with awe was Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the aspect of his father.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the air about him wildly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glared like Ishkoodah, the comet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the star with fiery tresses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with joy was Mudjekeewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked on Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw his youth rise up before him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the beauty of Wenonah
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the grave rise up before him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome!" said he, "Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kingdom of the West-Wind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long have I been waiting for you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth is lovely, age is lonely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth is fiery, age is frosty;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You bring back the days departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You bring back my youth of passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the beautiful Wenonah!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many days they talked together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questioned, listened, waited, answered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much the mighty Mudjekeewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasted of his ancient prowess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his perilous adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His indomitable courage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His invulnerable body.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patiently sat Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to his father's boasting;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile he sat and listened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttered neither threat nor menace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither word nor look betrayed him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his heart was hot within him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a living coal his heart was.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, "O Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there nothing that can harm you?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing that you are afraid of?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand and gracious in his boasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered, saying, "There is nothing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but the black rock yonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but the fatal Wawbeek!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he looked at Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wise look and benignant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a countenance paternal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked with pride upon the beauty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his tall and graceful figure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "O my Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything can harm you?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything you are afraid of?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wary Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused awhile, as if uncertain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held his peace, as if resolving,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then answered, "There is nothing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but the bulrush yonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but the great Apukwa!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as Mudjekeewis, rising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha cried in terror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried in well-dissembled terror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kago! kago! do not touch it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, kaween!" said Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No indeed, I will not touch it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they talked of other matters;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of Hiawatha's brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of Wabun, of the East-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the South-Wind, Shawondasee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the North, Kabibonokka;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then of Hiawatha's mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the beautiful Wenonah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her birth upon the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her death, as old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had remembered and related.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he cried, "O Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was you who killed Wenonah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took her young life and her beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the Lily of the Prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trampled it beneath your footsteps;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You confess it! you confess it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty Mudjekeewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tossed upon the wind his tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowed his hoary head in anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a silent nod assented.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then up started Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with threatening look and gesture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid his hand upon the black rock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fatal Wawbeek laid it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rent the jutting crag asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote and crushed it into fragments,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurled them madly at his father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remorseful Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his heart was hot within him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a living coal his heart was.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ruler of the West-Wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew the fragments backward from him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the breathing of his nostrils,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tempest of his anger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew them back at his assailant;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized the bulrush, the Apukwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragged it with its roots and fibres
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the margin of the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its ooze the giant bulrush;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long and loud laughed Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then began the deadly conflict,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand to hand among the mountains;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his eyry screamed the eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Keneu, the great war-eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat upon the crags around them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheeling flapped his wings above them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a tall tree in the tempest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent and lashed the giant bulrush;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in masses huge and heavy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crashing fell the fatal Wawbeek;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the earth shook with the tumult
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And confusion of the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the air was full of shoutings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thunder of the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting, answered, "Baim-wawa!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back retreated Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushing westward o'er the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stumbling westward down the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three whole days retreated fighting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still pursued by Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the doorways of the West-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the portals of the Sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the earth's remotest border,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where into the empty spaces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinks the sun, as a flamingo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drops into her nest at nightfall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the melancholy marshes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold!" at length cried Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold, my son, my Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is impossible to kill me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you cannot kill the immortal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have put you to this trial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to know and prove your courage;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now receive the prize of valor!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back to your home and people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live among them, toil among them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleanse the earth from all that harms it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear the fishing-grounds and rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slay all monsters and magicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Wendigoes, the giants,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the serpents, the Kenabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I slew the Mishe-Mokwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slew the Great Bear of the mountains.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And at last when Death draws near you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the awful eyes of Pauguk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glare upon you in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will share my kingdom with you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruler shall you be thenceforward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the home-wind, the Keewaydin."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was fought that famous battle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dreadful days of Shah-shah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days long since departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kingdom of the West-Wind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the hunter sees its traces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered far o'er hill and valley;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees the giant bulrush growing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the ponds and water-courses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees the masses of the Wawbeek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying still in every valley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward now went Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant was the landscape round him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant was the air above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bitterness of anger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had departed wholly from him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his brain the thought of vengeance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his heart the burning fever.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only once his pace he slackened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only once he paused or halted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused to purchase heads of arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the ancient Arrow-maker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Falls of Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash and gleam among the oak-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugh and leap into the valley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the ancient Arrow-maker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made his arrow-heads of sandstone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrow-heads of chalcedony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrow-heads of flint and jasper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoothed and sharpened at the edges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard and polished, keen and costly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him dwelt his dark-eyed daughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wayward as the Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her moods of shade and sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feet as rapid as the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tresses flowing like the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as musical a laughter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he named her from the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the water-fall he named her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnehaha, Laughing Water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it then for heads of arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrow-heads of chalcedony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrow-heads of flint and jasper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my Hiawatha halted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it not to see the maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the face of Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peeping from behind the curtain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the rustling of her garments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From behind the waving curtain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one sees the Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleaming, glancing through the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one hears the Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From behind its screen of branches?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall say what thoughts and visions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill the fiery brains of young men?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall say what dreams of beauty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the heart of Hiawatha?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All he told to old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he reached the lodge at sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the meeting with his father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was his fight with Mudjekeewis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a word he said of arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a word of Laughing Water.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA'S FASTING

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear how Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayed and fasted in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for greater skill in hunting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for greater craft in fishing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for triumphs in the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And renown among the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for profit of the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For advantage of the nations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First he built a lodge for fasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built a wigwam in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shining Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blithe and pleasant Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Moon of Leaves he built it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with dreams and visions many,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven whole days and nights he fasted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day of his fasting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the leafy woods he wandered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the deer start from the thicket,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the rabbit in his burrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the pheasant, Bena, drumming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rattling in his hoard of acorns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the pigeon, the Omeme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building nests among the pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in flocks the wild-goose, Wawa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying to the fen-lands northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirring, wailing far above him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master of Life!" he cried, desponding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must our lives depend on these things?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next day of his fasting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the river's brink he wandered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Muskoday, the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the wild rice, Mahnomonee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the blueberry, Meenahga,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strawberry, Odahmin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gooseberry, Shahbomin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grape-vine, the Bemahgut,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trailing o'er the alder-branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the air with fragrance!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master of Life!" he cried, desponding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must our lives depend on these things?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day of his fasting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the lake he sat and pondered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the still, transparent water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the sturgeon, Nahma, leaping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattering drops like beads of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the yellow perch, the Sahwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sunbeam in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the pike, the Maskenozha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the herring, Okahahwis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Shawgashee, the crawfish!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master of Life!" he cried, desponding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must our lives depend on these things?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day of his fasting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his lodge he lay exhausted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his couch of leaves and branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing with half-open eyelids,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of shadowy dreams and visions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dizzy, swimming landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gleaming of the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the splendor of the sunset.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he saw a youth approaching,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed in garments green and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming through the purple twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the splendor of the sunset;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his hair was soft and golden.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing at the open doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long he looked at Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked with pity and compassion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his wasted form and features,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in accents like the sighing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the South-Wind in the tree-tops,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he, "O my Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your prayers are heard in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you pray not like the others;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for greater skill in hunting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for greater craft in fishing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for triumph in the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor renown among the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for profit of the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For advantage of the nations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the Master of Life descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, the friend of man, Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to warn you and instruct you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How by struggle and by labor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall gain what you have prayed for.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise up from your bed of branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint with famine, Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started from his bed of branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the twilight of his wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into the flush of sunset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came, and wrestled with Mondamin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his touch he felt new courage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throbbing in his brain and bosom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt new life and hope and vigor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run through every nerve and fibre.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they wrestled there together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glory of the sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the more they strove and struggled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stronger still grew Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the darkness fell around them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her nest among the pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave a cry of lamentation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave a scream of pain and famine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is enough!" then said Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling upon Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But tomorrow, when the sun sets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come again to try you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he vanished, and was seen not;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether sinking as the rain sinks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether rising as the mists rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha saw not, knew not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only saw that he had vanished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving him alone and fainting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the misty lake below him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the reeling stars above him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morrow and the next day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun through heaven descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a red and burning cinder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the hearth of the Great Spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell into the western waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came Mondamin for the trial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the strife with Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came as silent as the dew comes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the empty air appearing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into empty air returning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking shape when earth it touches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But invisible to all men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its coming and its going.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice they wrestled there together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glory of the sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the darkness fell around them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her nest among the pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttered her loud cry of famine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mondamin paused to listen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall and beautiful he stood there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his garments green and yellow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To and fro his plumes above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved and nodded with his breathing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sweat of the encounter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood like drops of dew upon him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he cried, "O Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bravely have you wrestled with me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice have wrestled stoutly with me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Master of Life, who sees us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will give to you the triumph!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he smiled, and said: "To-morrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the last day of your conflict,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the last day of your fasting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will conquer and o'ercome me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a bed for me to lie in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the rain may fall upon me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sun may come and warm me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strip these garments, green and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strip this nodding plumage from me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay me in the earth, and make it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft and loose and light above me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let no hand disturb my slumber,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let no weed nor worm molest me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let not Kahgahgee, the raven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to haunt me and molest me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only come yourself to watch me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I wake, and start, and quicken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I leap into the sunshine."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus saying, he departed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacefully slept Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he heard the Wawonaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the whippoorwill complaining,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched upon his lonely wigwam;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the rushing Sebowisha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the rivulet rippling near him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking to the darksome forest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the sighing of the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they lifted and subsided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the passing of the night-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard them, as one hears in slumber
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far-off murmurs, dreamy whispers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacefully slept Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morrow came Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the seventh day of his fasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came with food for Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came imploring and bewailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest his hunger should o'ercome him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest his fasting should be fatal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he tasted not, and touched not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only said to her, "Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait until the sun is setting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the darkness falls around us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying from the desolate marshes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tells us that the day is ended."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward weeping went Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrowing for her Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing lest his strength should fail him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest his fasting should be fatal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meanwhile sat weary waiting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the coming of Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the shadows, pointing eastward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lengthened over field and forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sun dropped from the heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating on the waters westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a red leaf in the Autumn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falls and floats upon the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falls and sinks into its bosom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold! the young Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his soft and shining tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his garments green and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his long and glossy plumage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood and beckoned at the doorway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as one in slumber walking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale and haggard, but undaunted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wigwam Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came and wrestled with Mondamin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about him spun the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky and forest reeled together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his strong heart leaped within him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sturgeon leaps and struggles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a net to break its meshes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a ring of fire around him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blazed and flared the red horizon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a hundred suns seemed looking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the combat of the wrestlers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly upon the greensward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone stood Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panting with his wild exertion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palpitating with the struggle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before him breathless, lifeless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the youth, with hair dishevelled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plumage torn, and garments tattered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead he lay there in the sunset.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And victorious Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the grave as he commanded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped the garments from Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped his tattered plumage from him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid him in the earth, and made it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft and loose and light above him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the melancholy moorlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave a cry of lamentation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave a cry of pain and anguish!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward then went Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the lodge of old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the seven days of his fasting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were accomplished and completed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the place was not forgotten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he wrestled with Mondamin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor forgotten nor neglected
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the grave where lay Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeping in the rain and sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where his scattered plumes and garments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded in the rain and sunshine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day did Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to wait and watch beside it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept the dark mould soft above it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept it clean from weeds and insects,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove away, with scoffs and shoutings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the king of ravens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at length a small green feather
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the earth shot slowly upward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another and another,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before the Summer ended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the maize in all its beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its shining robes about it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its long, soft, yellow tresses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in rapture Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried aloud, "It is Mondamin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the friend of man, Mondamin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he called to old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iagoo, the great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed them where the maize was growing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told them of his wondrous vision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his wrestling and his triumph,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this new gift to the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which should be their food forever.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still later, when the Autumn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed the long, green leaves to yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soft and juicy kernels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew like wampum hard and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the ripened ears he gathered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped the withered husks from off them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he once had stripped the wrestler,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave the first Feast of Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made known unto the people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new gift of the Great Spirit.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two good friends had Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singled out from all the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound to him in closest union,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to whom he gave the right hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his heart, in joy and sorrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chibiabos, the musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very strong man, Kwasind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight between them ran the pathway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never grew the grass upon it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing birds, that utter falsehoods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story-tellers, mischief-makers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found no eager ear to listen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not breed ill-will between them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they kept each other's counsel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake with naked hearts together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondering much and much contriving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the tribes of men might prosper.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most beloved by Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the gentle Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the best of all musicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of all singers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful and childlike was he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave as man is, soft as woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pliant as a wand of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stately as a deer with antlers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he sang, the village listened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the warriors gathered round him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the women came to hear him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he stirred their souls to passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he melted them to pity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the hollow reeds he fashioned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flutes so musical and mellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the brook, the Sebowisha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceased to murmur in the woodland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the wood-birds ceased from singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rabbit, the Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat upright to look and listen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the brook, the Sebowisha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing, said, "O Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach my waves to flow in music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly as your words in singing!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envious, said, "O Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me tones as wild and wayward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me songs as full of frenzy!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyous, said, "O Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me tones as sweet and tender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me songs as full of gladness!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the whippoorwill, Wawonaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobbing, said, "O Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me tones as melancholy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me songs as full of sadness!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the many sounds of nature
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowed sweetness from his singing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the hearts of men were softened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the pathos of his music;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he sang of peace and freedom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang of beauty, love, and longing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang of death, and life undying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Islands of the Blessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Hereafter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very dear to Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the gentle Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the best of all musicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of all singers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his gentleness he loved him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magic of his singing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear, too, unto Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the very strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the strongest of all mortals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the mightiest among many;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his very strength he loved him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his strength allied to goodness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idle in his youth was Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very listless, dull, and dreamy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never played with other children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never fished and never hunted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not like other children was he;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they saw that much he fasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much his Manito entreated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much besought his Guardian Spirit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazy Kwasind!" said his mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my work you never help me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Summer you are roaming
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idly in the fields and forests;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Winter you are cowering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the firebrands in the wigwam!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coldest days of Winter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must break the ice for fishing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my nets you never help me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door my nets are hanging,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dripping, freezing with the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and wring them, Yenadizze!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and dry them in the sunshine!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, from the ashes, Kwasind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, but made no angry answer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lodge went forth in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took the nets, that hung together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dripping, freezing at the doorway;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wisp of straw he wrung them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wisp of straw he broke them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not wring them without breaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the strength was in his fingers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazy Kwasind!" said his father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the hunt you never help me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every bow you touch is broken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snapped asunder every arrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet come with me to the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall bring the hunting homeward."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down a narrow pass they wandered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a brooklet led them onward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the trail of deer and bison
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marked the soft mud on the margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they found all further passage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut against them, barred securely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the trunks of trees uprooted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying lengthwise, lying crosswise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forbidding further passage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must go back," said the old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O'er these logs we cannot clamber;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a woodchuck could get through them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a squirrel clamber o'er them!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straightway his pipe he lighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sat down to smoke and ponder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before his pipe was finished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the path was cleared before him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the trunks had Kwasind lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the right hand, to the left hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurled the cedars light as lances.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazy Kwasind!" said the young men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they sported in the meadow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why stand idly looking at us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning on the rock behind you?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come and wrestle with the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pitch the quoit together!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazy Kwasind made no answer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their challenge made no answer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only rose, and slowly turning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized the huge rock in his fingers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tore it from its deep foundation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poised it in the air a moment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitched it sheer into the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheer into the swift Pauwating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it still is seen in Summer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once as down that foaming river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the rapids of Pauwating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwasind sailed with his companions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stream he saw a beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw Ahmeek, the King of Beavers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggling with the rushing currents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising, sinking in the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without speaking, without pausing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwasind leaped into the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged beneath the bubbling surface,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the whirlpools chased the beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed him among the islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stayed so long beneath the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That his terrified companions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried, "Alas! good-by to Kwasind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall never more see Kwasind!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he reappeared triumphant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon his shining shoulders
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the beaver, dead and dripping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the King of all the Beavers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these two, as I have told you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the friends of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chibiabos, the musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very strong man, Kwasind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long they lived in peace together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake with naked hearts together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondering much and much contriving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the tribes of men might prosper.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA'S SAILING

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your bark, O Birch-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your yellow bark, O Birch-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing by the rushing river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall and stately in the valley!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I a light canoe will build me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall float on the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a yellow leaf in Autumn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a yellow water-lily!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lay aside your cloak, O Birch-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay aside your white-skin wrapper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Summer-time is coming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun is warm in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you need no white-skin wrapper!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus aloud cried Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the solitary forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the rushing Taquamenaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the birds were singing gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Moon of Leaves were singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun, from sleep awaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started up and said, "Behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gheezis, the great Sun, behold me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tree with all its branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rustled in the breeze of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, with a sigh of patience,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my cloak, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his knife the tree he girdled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just beneath its lowest branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just above the roots, he cut it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sap came oozing outward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the trunk, from top to bottom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheer he cleft the bark asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wooden wedge he raised it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your boughs, O Cedar!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your strong and pliant branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My canoe to make more steady,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make more strong and firm beneath me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the summit of the Cedar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went a sound, a cry of horror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went a murmur of resistance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it whispered, bending downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Take my boughs, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down he hewed the boughs of cedar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaped them straightway to a framework,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like two bows he formed and shaped them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like two bended bows together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your roots, O Tamarack!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your fibrous roots, O Larch-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My canoe to bind together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to bind the ends together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the water may not enter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the river may not wet me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Larch, with all its fibres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shivered in the air of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched his forehead with its tassels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slid, with one long sigh of sorrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take them all, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the earth he tore the fibres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tore the tough roots of the Larch-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closely sewed the bark together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound it closely to the frame-work.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your balm, O Fir-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your balsam and your resin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to close the seams together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the water may not enter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the river may not wet me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Fir-tree, tall and sombre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobbed through all its robes of darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rattled like a shore with pebbles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered wailing, answered weeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my balm, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he took the tears of balsam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took the resin of the Fir-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smeared therewith each seam and fissure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made each crevice safe from water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your quills, O Kagh, the Hedgehog!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make a necklace of them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a girdle for my beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And two stars to deck her bosom!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a hollow tree the Hedgehog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his sleepy eyes looked at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot his shining quills, like arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying with a drowsy murmur,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the tangle of his whiskers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my quills, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ground the quills he gathered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the little shining arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stained them red and blue and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the juice of roots and berries;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into his canoe he wrought them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round its waist a shining girdle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round its bows a gleaming necklace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its breast two stars resplendent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Birch Canoe was builded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley, by the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bosom of the forest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the forest's life was in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its mystery and its magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the lightness of the birch-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the toughness of the cedar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the larch's supple sinews;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it floated on the river
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a yellow leaf in Autumn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a yellow water-lily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddles none had Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddles none he had or needed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his thoughts as paddles served him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his wishes served to guide him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift or slow at will he glided,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veered to right or left at pleasure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he called aloud to Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Help me clear this river
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its sunken logs and sand-bars."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight into the river Kwasind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged as if he were an otter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dived as if he were a beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood up to his waist in water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his arm-pits in the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swam and scouted in the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tugged at sunken logs and branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hands he scooped the sand-bars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his feet the ooze and tangle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus sailed my Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the rushing Taquamenaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed through all its bends and windings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed through all its deeps and shallows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swam the deeps, the shallows waded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and down the river went they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out among its islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleared its bed of root and sand-bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragged the dead trees from its channel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made its passage safe and certain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a pathway for the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its springs among the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the waters of Pauwating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the bay of Taquamenaw.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA'S FISHING

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth upon the Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shining Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fishing-line of cedar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the twisted bark of cedar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth to catch the sturgeon Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mishe-Nahma, King of Fishes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his birch canoe exulting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone went Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the clear, transparent water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could see the fishes swimming
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far down in the depths below him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the yellow perch, the Sahwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sunbeam in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the Shawgashee, the craw-fish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a spider on the bottom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the white and sandy bottom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the stern sat Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fishing-line of cedar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his plumes the breeze of morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played as in the hemlock branches;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bows, with tail erected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the squirrel, Adjidaumo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his fur the breeze of morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played as in the prairie grasses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the white sand of the bottom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the monster Mishe-Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the sturgeon, King of Fishes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through his gills he breathed the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fins he fanned and winnowed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his tail he swept the sand-floor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he lay in all his armor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On each side a shield to guard him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plates of bone upon his forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down his sides and back and shoulders
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plates of bone with spines projecting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted was he with his war-paints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripes of yellow, red, and azure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spots of brown and spots of sable;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he lay there on the bottom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanning with his fins of purple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As above him Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his birch canoe came sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fishing-line of cedar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my bait," cried Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down into the depths beneath him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my bait, O Sturgeon, Nahma!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come up from below the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see which is the stronger!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he dropped his line of cedar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the clear, transparent water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited vainly for an answer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long sat waiting for an answer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And repeating loud and louder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my bait, O King of Fishes!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet lay the sturgeon, Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanning slowly in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to his call and clamor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His unnecessary tumult,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he wearied of the shouting;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said to the Kenozha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the pike, the Maskenozha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the bait of this rude fellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break the line of Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his fingers Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt the loose line jerk and tighten;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he drew it in, it tugged so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the birch canoe stood endwise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a birch log in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched and frisking on the summit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of scorn was Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw the fish rise upward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the pike, the Maskenozha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming nearer, nearer to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he shouted through the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Esa! esa! shame upon you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are but the pike, Kenozha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not the fish I wanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not the King of Fishes!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reeling downward to the bottom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank the pike in great confusion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty sturgeon, Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said to Ugudwash, the sun-fish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the bream, with scales of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the bait of this great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break the line of Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly upward, wavering, gleaming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized the line of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swung with all his weight upon it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a whirlpool in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirled the birch canoe in circles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round and round in gurgling eddies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the circles in the water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reached the far-off sandy beaches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the water-flags and rushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodded on the distant margins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Hiawatha saw him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly rising through the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifting up his disk refulgent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud he shouted in derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Esa! esa! shame upon you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are Ugudwash, the sun-fish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not the fish I wanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not the King of Fishes!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly downward, wavering, gleaming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again the sturgeon, Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the shout of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard his challenge of defiance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unnecessary tumult,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ringing far across the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the white sand of the bottom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up he rose with angry gesture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quivering in each nerve and fibre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clashing all his plates of armor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleaming bright with all his war-paint;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his wrath he darted upward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashing leaped into the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened his great jaws, and swallowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both canoe and Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down into that darksome cavern
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged the headlong Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a log on some black river
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoots and plunges down the rapids,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found himself in utter darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groped about in helpless wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he felt a great heart beating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throbbing in that utter darkness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he smote it in his anger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fist, the heart of Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt the mighty King of Fishes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shudder through each nerve and fibre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the water gurgle round him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he leaped and staggered through it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick at heart, and faint and weary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crosswise then did Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag his birch-canoe for safety,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest from out the jaws of Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the turmoil and confusion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth he might be hurled and perish.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frisked and chatted very gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the labor was completed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said Hiawatha to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O my little friend, the squirrel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bravely have you toiled to help me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the thanks of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the name which now he gives you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hereafter and forever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boys shall call you Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail-in-air the boys shall call you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again the sturgeon, Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasped and quivered in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then was still, and drifted landward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he grated on the pebbles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the listening Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard him grate upon the margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt him strand upon the pebbles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew that Nahma, King of Fishes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay there dead upon the margin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he heard a clang and flapping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of many wings assembling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard a screaming and confusion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of birds of prey contending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw a gleam of light above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining through the ribs of Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, peering,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing at him through the opening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard them saying to each other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is our brother, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he shouted from below them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried exulting from the caverns:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O ye sea-gulls! O my brothers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have slain the sturgeon, Nahma;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the rifts a little larger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your claws the openings widen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set me free from this dark prison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And henceforward and forever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men shall speak of your achievements,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling you Kayoshk, the sea-gulls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Kayoshk, the Noble Scratchers!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toiled with beak and claws together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the rifts and openings wider
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mighty ribs of Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from peril and from prison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the body of the sturgeon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the peril of the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They released my Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was standing near his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the margin of the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he called to old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called and beckoned to Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointed to the sturgeon, Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying lifeless on the pebbles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sea-gulls feeding on him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have slain the Mishe-Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slain the King of Fishes!" said he;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! the sea-gulls feed upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, my friends Kayoshk, the sea-gulls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive them not away, Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have saved me from great peril
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the body of the sturgeon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait until their meal is ended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till their craws are full with feasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they homeward fly, at sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their nests among the marshes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then bring all your pots and kettles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make oil for us in Winter."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she waited till the sun set,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the pallid moon, the Night-sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose above the tranquil water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Kayoshk, the sated sea-gulls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their banquet rose with clamor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And across the fiery sunset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winged their way to far-off islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their nests among the rushes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his sleep went Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nokomis to her labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toiling patient in the moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sun and moon changed places,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sky was red with sunrise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Kayoshk, the hungry sea-gulls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came back from the reedy islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clamorous for their morning banquet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three whole days and nights alternate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Nokomis and the sea-gulls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the waves washed through the rib-bones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sea-gulls came no longer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon the sands lay nothing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the skeleton of Nahma.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shores of Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the shining Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood Nokomis, the old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing with her finger westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the water pointing westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the purple clouds of sunset.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiercely the red sun descending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned his way along the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the sky on fire behind him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As war-parties, when retreating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burn the prairies on their war-trail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon, the Night-sun, eastward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly starting from his ambush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed fast those bloody footprints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed in that fiery war-trail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its glare upon his features.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nokomis, the old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing with her finger westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake these words to Hiawatha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yonder dwells the great Pearl-Feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Megissogwon, the Magician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manito of Wealth and Wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarded by his fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarded by the black pitch-water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see his fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kenabeek, the great serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coiling, playing in the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see the black pitch-water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretching far away beyond them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the purple clouds of sunset!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He it was who slew my father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his wicked wiles and cunning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he from the moon descended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came on earth to seek me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, the mightiest of Magicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the fever from the marshes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the pestilential vapors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the poisonous exhalations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the white fog from the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends disease and death among us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take your bow, O Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take your arrows, jasper-headed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take your war-club, Puggawaugun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your birch-canoe for sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the oil of Mishe-Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to smear its sides, that swiftly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may pass the black pitch-water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slay this merciless magician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the people from the fever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he breathes across the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And avenge my father's murder!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway then my Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed himself with all his war-gear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launched his birch-canoe for sailing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his palm its sides he patted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said with glee, "Cheemaun, my darling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my Birch-canoe! leap forward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you see the fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you see the black pitch-water!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward leaped Cheemaun exulting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the noble Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his war-song wild and woful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above him the war-eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Keneu, the great war-eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master of all fowls with feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screamed and hurtled through the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon he reached the fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kenabeek, the great serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying huge upon the water,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkling, rippling in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying coiled across the passage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their blazing crests uplifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing fiery fogs and vapors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that none could pass beyond them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fearless Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried aloud, and spake in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me pass my way, Kenabeek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go upon my journey!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they answered, hissing fiercely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their fiery breath made answer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back, go back! O Shaugodaya!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the angry Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised his mighty bow of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized his arrows, jasper-headed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot them fast among the serpents;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every twanging of the bow-string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a war-cry and a death-cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every whizzing of an arrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a death-song of Kenabeek.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weltering in the bloody water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead lay all the fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among them Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless sailed, and cried exulting:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Onward, O Cheemaun, my darling!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward to the black pitch-water!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took the oil of Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bows and sides anointed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smeared them well with oil, that swiftly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might pass the black pitch-water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night long he sailed upon it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed upon that sluggish water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered with its mould of ages,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black with rotting water-rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rank with flags and leaves of lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stagnant, lifeless, dreary, dismal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted by the shimmering moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by will-o'-the-wisps illumined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their weary night-encampments.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the air was white with moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the water black with shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around him the Suggema,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mosquito, sang his war-song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fire-flies, Wah-wah-taysee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved their torches to mislead him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bull-frog, the Dahinda,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust his head into the moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed his yellow eyes upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobbed and sank beneath the surface;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And anon a thousand whistles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered over all the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off on the reedy margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heralded the hero's coming.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward thus fared Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the realm of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the land of the Pearl-Feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the level moon stared at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his face stared pale and haggard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sun was hot behind him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it burned upon his shoulders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before him on the upland
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could see the Shining Wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Manito of Wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the mightiest of Magicians.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then once more Cheemaun he patted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his birch-canoe said, "Onward!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it stirred in all its fibres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with one great bound of triumph
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped across the water-lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped through tangled flags and rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon the beach beyond them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry-shod landed Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight he took his bow of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sand one end he rested,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his knee he pressed the middle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched the faithful bow-string tighter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took an arrow, jasper-headed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot it at the Shining Wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent it singing as a herald,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bearer of his message,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his challenge loud and lofty:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come forth from your lodge, Pearl-Feather!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha waits your coming!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway from the Shining Wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the mighty Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall of stature, broad of shoulder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark and terrible in aspect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad from head to foot in wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with all his warlike weapons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted like the sky of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaked with crimson, blue, and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crested with great eagle-feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming upward, streaming outward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well I know you, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried he in a voice of thunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tone of loud derision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hasten back, O Shaugodaya!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasten back among the women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will slay you as you stand there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of old I slew her father!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my Hiawatha answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing daunted, fearing nothing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big words do not smite like war-clubs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boastful breath is not a bow-string,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taunts are not so sharp as arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeds are better things than words are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions mightier than boastings!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then began the greatest battle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sun had ever looked on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the war-birds ever witnessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All a Summer's day it lasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sunrise to the sunset;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the shafts of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless hit the shirt of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless fell the blows he dealt it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless fell the heavy war-club;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could dash the rocks asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it could not break the meshes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that magic shirt of wampum.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at sunset Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning on his bow of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounded, weary, and desponding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mighty war-club broken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens torn and tattered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three useless arrows only,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From whose branches trailed the mosses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whose trunk was coated over
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Dead-man's Moccasin-leather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fungus white and yellow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly from the boughs above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the Mama, the woodpecker:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aim your arrows, Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the head of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike the tuft of hair upon it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At their roots the long black tresses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There alone can he be wounded!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winged with feathers, tipped with jasper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift flew Hiawatha's arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Megissogwon, stooping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised a heavy stone to throw it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full upon the crown it struck him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the roots of his long tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he reeled and staggered forward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunging like a wounded bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, like Pezhekee, the bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the snow is on the prairie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter flew the second arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pathway of the other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piercing deeper than the other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounding sorer than the other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the knees of Megissogwon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook like windy reeds beneath him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent and trembled like the rushes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the third and latest arrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftest flew, and wounded sorest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty Megissogwon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the fiery eyes of Pauguk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the eyes of Death glare at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard his voice call in the darkness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feet of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifeless lay the great Pearl-Feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the mightiest of Magicians.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the grateful Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called the Mama, the woodpecker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his perch among the branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the melancholy pine-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in honor of his service,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stained with blood the tuft of feathers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the little head of Mama;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to this day he wears it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wears the tuft of crimson feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a symbol of his service.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he stripped the shirt of wampum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the back of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a trophy of the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a signal of his conquest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore he left the body,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half on land and half in water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sand his feet were buried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his face was in the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above him, wheeled and clamored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Keneu, the great war-eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing round in narrower circles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovering nearer, nearer, nearer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wigwam Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore the wealth of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his wealth of skins and wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furs of bison and of beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furs of sable and of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wampum belts and strings and pouches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quivers wrought with beads of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with arrows, silver-headed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward then he sailed exulting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward through the black pitch-water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward through the weltering serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the trophies of the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a shout and song of triumph.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore stood old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore stood Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the hero's coming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to his songs of triumph.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people of the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcomed him with songs and dances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a joyous feast, and shouted:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor be to Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has slain the great Pearl-Feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slain the mightiest of Magicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him, who sent the fiery fever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the white fog from the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent disease and death among us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever dear to Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the memory of Mama!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in token of his friendship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mark of his remembrance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He adorned and decked his pipe-stem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the crimson tuft of feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blood-red crest of Mama.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wealth of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the trophies of the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He divided with his people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared it equally among them.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA'S WOOING

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As unto the bow the cord is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unto the man is woman;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though she bends him, she obeys him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though she draws him, yet she follows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Useless each without the other!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the youthful Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said within himself and pondered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much perplexed by various feelings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listless, longing, hoping, fearing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreaming still of Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lovely Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wed a maiden of your people,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning said the old Nokomis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go not eastward, go not westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a stranger, whom we know not!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a fire upon the hearth-stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a neighbor's homely daughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the starlight or the moonlight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the handsomest of strangers!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus dissuading spake Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my Hiawatha answered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this: "Dear old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very pleasant is the firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I like the starlight better,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better do I like the moonlight!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravely then said old Nokomis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring not here an idle maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring not here a useless woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands unskilful, feet unwilling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring a wife with nimble fingers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart and hand that move together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feet that run on willing errands!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling answered Hiawatha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the land of the Dacotahs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives the Arrow-maker's daughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnehaha, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsomest of all the women.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will bring her to your wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shall run upon your errands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be the sunlight of my people!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still dissuading said Nokomis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring not to my lodge a stranger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Dacotahs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very fierce are the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often is there war between us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are feuds yet unforgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounds that ache and still may open!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing answered Hiawatha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For that reason, if no other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would I wed the fair Dacotah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That our tribes might be united,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That old feuds might be forgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And old wounds be healed forever!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus departed Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of handsome women;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Striding over moor and meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through interminable forests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through uninterrupted silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his moccasins of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each stride a mile he measured;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the way seemed long before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heart outran his footsteps;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he journeyed without resting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he heard the cataract's laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling to him through the silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pleasant is the sound!" he murmured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pleasant is the voice that calls me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outskirts of the forests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herds of fallow deer were feeding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they saw not Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his bow he whispered, "Fail not!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his arrow whispered, "Swerve not!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent it singing on its errand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the red heart of the roebuck;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw the deer across his shoulder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sped forward without pausing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of his wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the ancient Arrow-maker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making arrow-heads of jasper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrow-heads of chalcedony.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his side, in all her beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the lovely Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat his daughter, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaiting mats of flags and rushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the past the old man's thoughts were,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maiden's of the future.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thinking, as he sat there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the days when with such arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had struck the deer and bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Muskoday, the meadow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot the wild goose, flying southward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wing, the clamorous Wawa;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the great war-parties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they came to buy his arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not fight without his arrows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, no more such noble warriors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could be found on earth as they were!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the men were all like women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only used their tongues for weapons!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was thinking of a hunter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From another tribe and country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young and tall and very handsome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who one morning, in the Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to buy her father's arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat and rested in the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingered long about the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back as he departed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had heard her father praise him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise his courage and his wisdom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he come again for arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Falls of Minnehaha?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mat her hands lay idle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her eyes were very dreamy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through their thoughts they heard a footstep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard a rustling in the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with glowing cheek and forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the deer upon his shoulders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly from out the woodlands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha stood before them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight the ancient Arrow-maker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked up gravely from his labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid aside the unfinished arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade him enter at the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, as he rose to meet him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hiawatha, you are welcome!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feet of Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha laid his burden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw the red deer from his shoulders;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maiden looked up at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked up from her mat of rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said with gentle look and accent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are welcome, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very spacious was the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of deer-skins dressed and whitened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Gods of the Dacotahs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn and painted on its curtains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so tall the doorway, hardly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha stooped to enter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly touched his eagle-feathers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he entered at the doorway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then uprose the Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ground fair Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid aside her mat unfinished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought forth food and set before them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water brought them from the brooklet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave them food in earthen vessels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened while the guest was speaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened while her father answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not once her lips she opened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a single word she uttered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, as in a dream she listened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the words of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he talked of old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had nursed him in his childhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he told of his companions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chibiabos, the musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of happiness and plenty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Ojibways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant land and peaceful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After many years of warfare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years of strife and bloodshed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is peace between the Ojibways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tribe of the Dacotahs."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus continued Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then added, speaking slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this peace may last forever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our hands be clasped more closely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our hearts be more united,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me as my wife this maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnehaha, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loveliest of Dacotah women!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ancient Arrow-maker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused a moment ere he answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoked a little while in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked at Hiawatha proudly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fondly looked at Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made answer very gravely:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, if Minnehaha wishes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lovely Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed more lovely as she stood there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither willing nor reluctant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she went to Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly took the seat beside him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she said, and blushed to say it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will follow you, my husband!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was Hiawatha's wooing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was he won the daughter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the ancient Arrow-maker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wigwam he departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading with him Laughing Water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand in hand they went together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the woodland and the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left the old man standing lonely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling to them from the distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying to them from afar off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ancient Arrow-maker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned again unto his labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat down by his sunny doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmuring to himself, and saying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus it is our daughters leave us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those we love, and those who love us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when they have learned to help us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are old and lean upon them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes a youth with flaunting feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his flute of reeds, a stranger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanders piping through the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckons to the fairest maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she follows where he leads her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving all things for the stranger!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant was the journey homeward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through interminable forests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over meadow, over mountain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over river, hill, and hollow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short it seemed to Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they journeyed very slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though his pace he checked and slackened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the steps of Laughing Water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over wide and rushing rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his arms he bore the maiden;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light he thought her as a feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the plume upon his head-gear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleared the tangled pathway for her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent aside the swaying branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made at night a lodge of branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a bed with boughs of hemlock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a fire before the doorway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dry cones of the pine-tree.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the travelling winds went with them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the meadows, through the forest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the stars of night looked at them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his ambush in the oak-tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched with eager eyes the lovers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rabbit, the Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scampered from the path before them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peering, peeping from his burrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat erect upon his haunches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched with curious eyes the lovers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant was the journey homeward!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the birds sang loud and sweetly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of happiness and heart's-ease;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy are you, Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having such a wife to love you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy are you, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having such a noble husband!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sky the sun benignant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked upon them through the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying to them, "O my children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is sunshine, hate is shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is checkered shade and sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule by love, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sky the moon looked at them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the lodge with mystic splendors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered to them, "O my children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day is restless, night is quiet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man imperious, woman feeble;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half is mine, although I follow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule by patience, Laughing Water!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was they journeyed homeward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was that Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the lodge of old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the moonlight, starlight, firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the sunshine of his people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnehaha, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsomest of all the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of handsome women.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the handsome Yenadizze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced at Hiawatha's wedding;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the gentle Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of musicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his songs of love and longing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Iagoo, the great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the marvellous story-teller,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told his tales of strange adventure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feast might be more joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the time might pass more gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the guests be more contented.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sumptuous was the feast Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made at Hiawatha's wedding;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the bowls were made of bass-wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White and polished very smoothly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the spoons of horn of bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black and polished very smoothly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had sent through all the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messengers with wands of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sign of invitation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a token of the feasting;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wedding guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad in all their richest raiment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robes of fur and belts of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splendid with their paint and plumage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful with beads and tassels.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First they ate the sturgeon, Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pike, the Maskenozha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught and cooked by old Nokomis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on pemican they feasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pemican and buffalo marrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunch of deer and hump of bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow cakes of the Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wild rice of the river.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gracious Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lovely Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the careful old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasted not the food before them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only waited on the others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only served their guests in silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when all the guests had finished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Nokomis, brisk and busy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an ample pouch of otter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the red-stone pipes for smoking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tobacco from the South-land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixed with bark of the red willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with herbs and leaves of fragrance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she said, "O Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance for us your merry dances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance the Beggar's Dance to please us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feast may be more joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the time may pass more gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our guests be more contented!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the idle Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the merry mischief-maker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom the people called the Storm-Fool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose among the guests assembled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skilled was he in sports and pastimes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the merry dance of snow-shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the play of quoits and ball-play;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skilled was he in games of hazard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all games of skill and hazard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pugasaing, the Bowl and Counters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuntassoo, the Game of Plum-stones.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the warriors called him Faint-Heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called him coward, Shaugodaya,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idler, gambler, Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little heeded he their jesting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little cared he for their insults,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the women and the maidens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dressed in shirt of doeskin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White and soft, and fringed with ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All inwrought with beads of wampum;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dressed in deer-skin leggings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in moccasins of buck-skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick with quills and beads embroidered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his head were plumes of swan's down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his heels were tails of foxes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one hand a fan of feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a pipe was in the other.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barred with streaks of red and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaks of blue and bright vermilion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone the face of Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his forehead fell his tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth, and parted like a woman's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining bright with oil, and plaited,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung with braids of scented grasses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As among the guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sound of flutes and singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sound of drums and voices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And began his mystic dances.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First he danced a solemn measure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very slow in step and gesture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out among the pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the shadows and the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treading softly like a panther.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then more swiftly and still swifter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirling, spinning round in circles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaping o'er the guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddying round and round the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the leaves went whirling with him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the dust and wind together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept in eddies round about him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then along the sandy margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lake, the Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On he sped with frenzied gestures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamped upon the sand, and tossed it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildly in the air around him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the wind became a whirlwind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sand was blown and sifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like great snowdrifts o'er the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaping all the shores with Sand Dunes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand Hills of the Nagow Wudjoo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the merry Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced his Beggar's Dance to please them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, returning, sat down laughing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There among the guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat and fanned himself serenely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fan of turkey-feathers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they said to Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the friend of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sweetest of all singers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the best of all musicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sing to us, O Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of love and songs of longing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feast may be more joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the time may pass more gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our guests be more contented!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gentle Chibiabos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang in accents sweet and tender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang in tones of deep emotion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of love and songs of longing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking still at Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at fair Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang he softly, sang in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Onaway!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake, beloved!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou the wild-flower of the forest!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou the wild-bird of the prairie!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou with eyes so soft and fawn-like!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If thou only lookest at me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy, I am happy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the lilies of the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they feel the dew upon them!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet thy breath is as the fragrance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wild-flowers in the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their fragrance is at evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Moon when leaves are falling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does not all the blood within me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leap to meet thee, leap to meet thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the springs to meet the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Moon when nights are brightest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Onaway! my heart sings to thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sings with joy when thou art near me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sighing, singing branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant Moon of Strawberries!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When thou art not pleased, beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my heart is sad and darkened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the shining river darkens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the clouds drop shadows on it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When thou smilest, my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my troubled heart is brightened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in sunshine gleam the ripples
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the cold wind makes in rivers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smiles the earth, and smile the waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile the cloudless skies above us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I lose the way of smiling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou art no longer near me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I myself, myself! behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood of my beating heart, behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh awake, awake, beloved!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onaway! awake, beloved!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the gentle Chibiabos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his song of love and longing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iagoo, the great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the marvellous story-teller,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the friend of old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous of the sweet musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous of the applause they gave him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw in all the eyes around him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw in all their looks and gestures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the wedding guests assembled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longed to hear his pleasant stories,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His immeasurable falsehoods.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very boastful was Iagoo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never heard he an adventure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But himself had met a greater;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never any deed of daring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But himself had done a bolder;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never any marvellous story
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But himself could tell a stranger.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you listen to his boasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you only give him credence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one ever shot an arrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half so far and high as he had;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever caught so many fishes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever killed so many reindeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever trapped so many beaver!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None could run so fast as he could,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None could dive so deep as he could,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None could swim so far as he could;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None had made so many journeys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None had seen so many wonders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this wonderful Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this marvellous story-teller!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus his name became a by-word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a jest among the people;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whene'er a boastful hunter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praised his own address too highly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a warrior, home returning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talked too much of his achievements,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his hearers cried, "Iagoo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's Iagoo come among us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who carved the cradle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the little Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carved its framework out of linden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound it strong with reindeer sinews;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who taught him later
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to make his bows and arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to make the bows of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the arrows of the oak-tree.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So among the guests assembled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my Hiawatha's wedding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat Iagoo, old and ugly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the marvellous story-teller.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they said, "O good Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us now a tale of wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us of some strange adventure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feast may be more joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the time may pass more gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our guests be more contented!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iagoo answered straightway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shall hear a tale of wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear the strange adventures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Osseo, the Magician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Evening Star descending."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it be the sun descending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the level plain of water?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the Red Swan floating, flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounded by the magic arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staining all the waves with crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the crimson of its life-blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the air with splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the splendor of its plumage?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes; it is the sun descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking down into the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sky is stained with purple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the water flushed with crimson!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No; it is the Red Swan floating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diving down beneath the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sky its wings are lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its blood the waves are reddened!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over it the Star of Evening
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melts and trembles through the purple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hangs suspended in the twilight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No; it is a bead of wampum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the robes of the Great Spirit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he passes through the twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walks in silence through the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This with joy beheld Iagoo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said in haste: "Behold it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the sacred Star of Evening!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear a tale of wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the story of Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of the Evening Star, Osseo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once, in days no more remembered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ages nearer the beginning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heavens were closer to us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Gods were more familiar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the North-land lived a hunter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ten young and comely daughters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall and lithe as wands of willow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Oweenee, the youngest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She the wilful and the wayward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She the silent, dreamy maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the fairest of the sisters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All these women married warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Married brave and haughty husbands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Oweenee, the youngest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed and flouted all her lovers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her young and handsome suitors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then married old Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Osseo, poor and ugly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken with age and weak with coughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always coughing like a squirrel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, but beautiful within him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the spirit of Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Evening Star descended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star of Evening, Star of Woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star of tenderness and passion!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its fire was in his bosom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its beauty in his spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its mystery in his being,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its splendor in his language!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And her lovers, the rejected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsome men with belts of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsome men with paint and feathers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointed at her in derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed her with jest and laughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she said: 'I care not for you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care not for your belts of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care not for your paint and feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care not for your jests and laughter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy with Osseo!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once to some great feast invited,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the damp and dusk of evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked together the ten sisters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked together with their husbands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly followed old Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fair Oweenee beside him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the others chatted gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two only walked in silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the western sky Osseo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed intent, as if imploring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often stopped and gazed imploring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the trembling Star of Evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the tender Star of Woman;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they heard him murmur softly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ah, showain nemeshin, Nosa!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pity, pity me, my father!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Listen!' said the eldest sister,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He is praying to his father!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a pity that the old man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not stumble in the pathway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not break his neck by falling!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they laughed till all the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang with their unseemly laughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On their pathway through the woodlands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay an oak, by storms uprooted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the great trunk of an oak-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried half in leaves and mosses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouldering, crumbling, huge and hollow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Osseo, when he saw it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave a shout, a cry of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped into its yawning cavern,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one end went in an old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other came a young man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall and straight and strong and handsome.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus Osseo was transfigured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus restored to youth and beauty;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, alas for good Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Oweenee, the faithful!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangely, too, was she transfigured.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed into a weak old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a staff she tottered onward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sisters and their husbands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed until the echoing forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang with their unseemly laughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Osseo turned not from her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked with slower step beside her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took her hand, as brown and withered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an oak-leaf is in Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called her sweetheart, Nenemoosha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothed her with soft words of kindness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they reached the lodge of feasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they sat down in the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred to the Star of Evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the tender Star of Woman.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wrapt in visions, lost in dreaming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the banquet sat Osseo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were merry, all were happy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were joyous but Osseo.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither food nor drink he tasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither did he speak nor listen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as one bewildered sat he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking dreamily and sadly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First at Oweenee, then upward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gleaming sky above them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then a voice was heard, a whisper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the starry distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the empty vastness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low, and musical, and tender;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the voice said: 'O Osseo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my son, my best beloved!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken are the spells that bound you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the charms of the magicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic powers of evil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to me; ascend, Osseo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Taste the food that stands before you:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is blessed and enchanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has magic virtues in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will change you to a spirit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your bowls and all your kettles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be wood and clay no longer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bowls be changed to wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the kettles shall be silver;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shall shine like shells of scarlet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the fire shall gleam and glimmer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'And the women shall no longer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear the dreary doom of labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But be changed to birds, and glisten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beauty of the starlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted with the dusky splendors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the skies and clouds of evening!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What Osseo heard as whispers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What as words he comprehended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was but music to the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music as of birds afar off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the whippoorwill afar off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lonely Wawonaissa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing in the darksome forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then the lodge began to tremble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight began to shake and tremble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they felt it rising, rising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly through the air ascending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the darkness of the tree-tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into the dewy starlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it passed the topmost branches;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold! the wooden dishes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were changed to shells of scarlet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold! the earthen kettles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were changed to bowls of silver!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roof-poles of the wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were as glittering rods of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roof of bark upon them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the shining shards of beetles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then Osseo gazed around him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he saw the nine fair sisters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sisters and their husbands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to birds of various plumage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some were jays and some were magpies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others thrushes, others blackbirds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they hopped, and sang, and twittered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perked and fluttered all their feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strutted in their shining plumage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their tails like fans unfolded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only Oweenee, the youngest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not changed, but sat in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking sadly at the others;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Osseo, gazing upward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave another cry of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a cry as he had uttered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the oak-tree in the forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then returned her youth and beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her soiled and tattered garments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were transformed to robes of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her staff became a feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a shining silver feather!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And again the wigwam trembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swayed and rushed through airy currents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through transparent cloud and vapor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amid celestial splendors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Evening Star alighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a snow-flake falls on snow-flake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a leaf drops on a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the thistledown on water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forth with cheerful words of welcome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the father of Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He with radiant locks of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He with eyes serene and tender.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said: 'My son, Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang the cage of birds you bring there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang the cage with rods of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the birds with glistening feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of my wigwam.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the door he hung the bird-cage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they entered in and gladly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened to Osseo's father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruler of the Star of Evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said: 'O my Osseo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had compassion on you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given you back your youth and beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into birds of various plumage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed your sisters and their husbands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed them thus because they mocked you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the figure of the old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that aspect sad and wrinkled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not see your heart of passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not see your youth immortal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Oweenee, the faithful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw your naked heart and loved you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'In the lodge that glimmers yonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the little star that twinkles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the vapors, on the left hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives the envious Evil Spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wabeno, the magician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who transformed you to an old man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take heed lest his beams fall on you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rays he darts around him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the power of his enchantment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the arrows that he uses.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many years, in peace and quiet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the peaceful Star of Evening
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelt Osseo with his father;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years, in song and flutter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung the cage with rods of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fair Oweenee, the faithful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore a son unto Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beauty of his mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the courage of his father.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the boy grew up and prospered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Osseo, to delight him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made him little bows and arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened the great cage of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let loose his aunts and uncles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those birds with glossy feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his little son to shoot at.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Round and round they wheeled and darted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the Evening Star with music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their songs of joy and freedom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the Evening Star with splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fluttering of their plumage;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the boy, the little hunter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent his bow and shot an arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot a swift and fatal arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a bird, with shining feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet fell wounded sorely.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, O wondrous transformation!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was no bird he saw before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was a beautiful young woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrow in her bosom!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When her blood fell on the planet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sacred Star of Evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken was the spell of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerless was the strange enchantment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the youth, the fearless bowman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly felt himself descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held by unseen hands, but sinking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward through the empty spaces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward through the clouds and vapors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he rested on an island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an island, green and grassy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder in the Big-Sea-Water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After him he saw descending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the birds with shining feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluttering, falling, wafted downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the painted leaves of Autumn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lodge with poles of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its roof like wings of beetles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the shining shards of beetles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the winds of heaven uplifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly sank upon the island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing back the good Osseo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing Oweenee, the faithful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then the birds, again transfigured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassumed the shape of mortals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took their shape, but not their stature;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They remained as Little People,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the pygmies, the Puk-Wudjies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on pleasant nights of Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Evening Star was shining,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand in hand they danced together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the island's craggy headlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sand-beach low and level.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still their glittering lodge is seen there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tranquil Summer evenings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon the shore the fisher
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes hears their happy voices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees them dancing in the starlight!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the story was completed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wondrous tale was ended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking round upon his listeners,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemnly Iagoo added:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are great men, I have known such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom their people understand not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom they even make a jest of,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scoff and jeer at in derision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the story of Osseo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us learn the fate of jesters!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wedding guests delighted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened to the marvellous story,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened laughing and applauding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they whispered to each other:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does he mean himself, I wonder?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are we the aunts and uncles?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again sang Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang a song of love and longing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those accents sweet and tender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those tones of pensive sadness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang a maiden's lamentation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her lover, her Algonquin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I think of my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! think of my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my heart is thinking of him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah me! when I parted from him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round my neck he hung the wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pledge, the snow-white wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go with you, he whispered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! to your native country;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go with you, he whispered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Far away, away, I answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very far away, I answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! is my native country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I looked back to behold him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we parted, to behold him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After me he still was gazing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By the tree he still was standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the fallen tree was standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had dropped into the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I think of my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! think of my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my heart is thinking of him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was Hiawatha's Wedding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the dance of Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the story of Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the songs of Chibiabos;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the wedding banquet ended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wedding guests departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving Hiawatha happy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the night and Minnehaha.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLESSING THE CORNFIELDS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing, O Song of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the happy days that followed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Ojibways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant land and peaceful!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing the mysteries of Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing the Blessing of the Cornfields!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried was the bloody hatchet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried was the dreadful war-club,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried were all warlike weapons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the war-cry was forgotten.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was peace among the nations;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmolested roved the hunters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built the birch canoe for sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught the fish in lake and river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot the deer and trapped the beaver;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmolested worked the women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made their sugar from the maple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathered wild rice in the meadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed the skins of deer and beaver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around the happy village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the maize-fields, green and shining,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved the green plumes of Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved his soft and sunny tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the land with plenty.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the women who in Spring-time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planted the broad fields and fruitful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried in the earth Mondamin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the women who in Autumn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped the yellow husks of harvest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped the garments from Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as Hiawatha taught them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, when all the maize was planted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha, wise and thoughtful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake and said to Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his wife, the Laughing Water:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shall bless to-night the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw a magic circle round them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect them from destruction,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blast of mildew, blight of insect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagemin, the thief of cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paimosaid, who steals the maize-ear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the night, when all is silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, when all is darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuts the doors of all the wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that not an ear can hear you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that not an eye can see you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise up from your bed in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay aside your garments wholly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk around the fields you planted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the borders of the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered by your tresses only,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robed with darkness as a garment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus the fields shall be more fruitful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the passing of your footsteps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw a magic circle round them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that neither blight nor mildew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither burrowing worm nor insect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall pass o'er the magic circle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the dragon-fly, Kwo-ne-she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the spider, Subbekashe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the mighty caterpillar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Way-muk-kwana, with the bear-skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King of all the caterpillars!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tree-tops near the cornfields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the hungry crows and ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his band of black marauders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they laughed at Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the tree-tops shook with laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their melancholy laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the words of Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hear him!" said they; "hear the Wise Man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the plots of Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the noiseless night descended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad and dark o'er field and forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mournful Wawonaissa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrowing sang among the hemlocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut the doors of all the wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her bed rose Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid aside her garments wholly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with darkness clothed and guarded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unashamed and unaffrighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked securely round the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew the sacred, magic circle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her footprints round the cornfields.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one but the Midnight only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw her beauty in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one but the Wawonaissa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the panting of her bosom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guskewau, the darkness, wrapped her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closely in his sacred mantle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that none might see her beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that none might boast, "I saw her!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morrow, as the day dawned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathered all his black marauders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crows and blackbirds, jays and ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clamorous on the dusky tree-tops,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And descended, fast and fearless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fields of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grave of the Mondamin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will drag Mondamin," said they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the grave where he is buried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spite of all the magic circles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing Water draws around it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spite of all the sacred footprints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnehaha stamps upon it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wary Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever thoughtful, careful, watchful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had o'erheard the scornful laughter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they mocked him from the tree-tops.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaw!" he said, "my friends the ravens!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, my King of Ravens!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will teach you all a lesson
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall not be soon forgotten!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had risen before the daybreak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had spread o'er all the cornfields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snares to catch the black marauders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was lying now in ambush
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the neighboring grove of pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the crows and blackbirds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the jays and ravens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon they came with caw and clamor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rush of wings and cry of voices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their work of devastation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settling down upon the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delving deep with beak and talon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the body of Mondamin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with all their craft and cunning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All their skill in wiles of warfare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They perceived no danger near them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till their claws became entangled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they found themselves imprisoned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snares of Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his place of ambush came he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Striding terrible among them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so awful was his aspect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the bravest quailed with terror.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without mercy he destroyed them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right and left, by tens and twenties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their wretched, lifeless bodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung aloft on poles for scarecrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the consecrated cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a signal of his vengeance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a warning to marauders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Kahgahgee, the leader,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He alone was spared among them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a hostage for his people.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his prisoner-string he bound him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led him captive to his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied him fast with cords of elm-bark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ridge-pole of his wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kahgahgee, my raven!" said he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You the leader of the robbers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You the plotter of this mischief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contriver of this outrage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will keep you, I will hold you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a hostage for your people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pledge of good behavior!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he left him, grim and sulky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting in the morning sunshine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the summit of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Croaking fiercely his displeasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flapping his great sable pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly struggling for his freedom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly calling on his people!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer passed, and Shawondasee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed his sighs o'er all the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the South-land sent his ardor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wafted kisses warm and tender;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maize-field grew and ripened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it stood in all the splendor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its garments green and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its tassels and its plumage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maize-ears full and shining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Nokomis, the old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake, and said to Minnehaha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the Moon when leaves are falling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wild-rice has been gathered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maize is ripe and ready;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us gather in the harvest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us wrestle with Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strip him of his plumes and tassels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his garments green and yellow!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the merry Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went rejoicing from the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Nokomis, old and wrinkled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they called the women round them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called the young men and the maidens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the harvest of the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the husking of the maize-ear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the border of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the fragrant pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the old men and the warriors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking in the pleasant shadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In uninterrupted silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked they at the gamesome labor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the young men and the women;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened to their noisy talking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their laughter and their singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard them chattering like the magpies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard them laughing like the blue-jays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard them singing like the robins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whene'er some lucky maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a red ear in the husking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a maize-ear red as blood is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nushka!" cried they all together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nushka! you shall have a sweetheart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall have a handsome husband!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh!" the old men all responded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their seats beneath the pine-trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whene'er a youth or maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a crooked ear in husking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a maize-ear in the husking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blighted, mildewed, or misshapen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they laughed and sang together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept and limped about the cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mimicked in their gait and gestures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some old man, bent almost double,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing singly or together:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wagemin, the thief of cornfields!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paimosaid, who steals the maize-ear!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the cornfields rang with laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till from Hiawatha's wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screamed and quivered in his anger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from all the neighboring tree-tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cawed and croaked the black marauders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh!" the old men all responded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their seats beneath the pine-trees!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PICTURE-WRITING

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days said Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo! how all things fade and perish!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the memory of the old men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass away the great traditions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements of the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventures of the hunters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wisdom of the Medas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the craft of the Wabenos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the marvellous dreams and visions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Jossakeeds, the Prophets!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great men die and are forgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise men speak; their words of wisdom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perish in the ears that hear them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not reach the generations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, as yet unborn, are waiting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great, mysterious darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the speechless days that shall be!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the grave-posts of our fathers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are no signs, no figures painted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are in those graves we know not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only know they are our fathers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what kith they are and kindred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what old, ancestral Totem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be it Eagle, Bear, or Beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They descended, this we know not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only know they are our fathers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Face to face we speak together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot speak when absent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot send our voices from us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the friends that dwell afar off;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot send a secret message,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bearer learns our secret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May pervert it, may betray it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May reveal it unto others."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus said Hiawatha, walking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the solitary forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondering, musing in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the welfare of his people.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his pouch he took his colors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took his paints of different colors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the smooth bark of a birch-tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted many shapes and figures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful and mystic figures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each figure had a meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each some word or thought suggested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito the Mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, the Master of Life, was painted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an egg, with points projecting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the four winds of the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere is the Great Spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the meaning of this symbol.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitche Manito the Mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the dreadful Spirit of Evil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a serpent was depicted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Kenabeek, the great serpent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very crafty, very cunning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the creeping Spirit of Evil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the meaning of this symbol.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life and Death he drew as circles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life was white, but Death was darkened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun and moon and stars he painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man and beast, and fish and reptile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forests, mountains, lakes, and rivers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the earth he drew a straight line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sky a bow above it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White the space between for daytime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with little stars for night-time;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left a point for sunrise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right a point for sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top a point for noontide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for rain and cloudy weather
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waving lines descending from it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Footprints pointing towards a wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were a sign of invitation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were a sign of guests assembling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloody hands with palms uplifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were a symbol of destruction,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were a hostile sign and symbol.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these things did Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show unto his wondering people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And interpreted their meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said: "Behold, your grave-posts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have no mark, no sign, nor symbol,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and paint them all with figures;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one with its household symbol,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its own ancestral Totem;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that those who follow after
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May distinguish them and know them."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they painted on the grave-posts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the graves yet unforgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each his own ancestral Totem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each the symbol of his household;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures of the Bear and Reindeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Turtle, Crane, and Beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each inverted as a token
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the owner was departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the chief who bore the symbol
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay beneath in dust and ashes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wabenos, the Magicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Medicine-men, the Medas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted upon bark and deer-skin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures for the songs they chanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each song a separate symbol,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures mystical and awful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures strange and brightly colored;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each figure had its meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each some magic song suggested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Spirit, the Creator,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashing light through all the heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Serpent, the Kenabeek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his bloody crest erected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creeping, looking into heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky the sun, that listens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon eclipsed and dying;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl and eagle, crane and hen-hawk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cormorant, bird of magic;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headless men, that walk the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodies lying pierced with arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloody hands of death uplifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flags on graves, and great war-captains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasping both the earth and heaven!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as these the shapes they painted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the birch-bark and the deer-skin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of war and songs of hunting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of medicine and of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were written in these figures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each figure had its meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each its separate song recorded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor forgotten was the Love-Song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most subtle of all medicines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most potent spell of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous more than war or hunting!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Love-Song was recorded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbol and interpretation.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a human figure standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted in the brightest scarlet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is the lover, the musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the meaning is, "My painting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes me powerful over others."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the figure seated, singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing on a drum of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the interpretation, "Listen!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is my voice you hear, my singing!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the same red figure seated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shelter of a wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the meaning of the symbol,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will come and sit beside you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mystery of my passion!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two figures, man and woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing hand in hand together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their hands so clasped together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they seemed in one united,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the words thus represented
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are, "I see your heart within you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your cheeks are red with blushes!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next the maiden on an island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the centre of an island;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the song this shape suggested
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was, "Though you were at a distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were upon some far-off island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the spell I cast upon you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the magic power of passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could straightway draw you to me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the figure of the maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeping, and the lover near her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispering to her in her slumbers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Though you were far from me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of Sleep and Silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the voice of love would reach you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the last of all the figures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a heart within a circle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn within a magic circle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the image had this meaning:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naked lies your heart before me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your naked heart I whisper!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was that Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his wisdom, taught the people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the mysteries of painting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the art of Picture-Writing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the smooth bark of the birch-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the white skin of the reindeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grave-posts of the village.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days the Evil Spirits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Manitos of mischief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing Hiawatha's wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his love for Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous of their faithful friendship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their noble words and actions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made at length a league against them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To molest them and destroy them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha, wise and wary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often said to Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O my brother! do not leave me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the Evil Spirits harm you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chibiabos, young and heedless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing shook his coal-black tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered ever sweet and childlike,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not fear for me, O brother!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harm and evil come not near me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once when Peboan, the Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roofed with ice the Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the snow-flakes, whirling downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hissed among the withered oak-leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed the pine-trees into wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered all the earth with silence,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with arrows, shod with snow-shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heeding not his brother's warning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing not the Evil Spirits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth to hunt the deer with antlers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone went Chibiabos.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right across the Big-Sea-Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang with speed the deer before him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the wind and snow he followed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the treacherous ice he followed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild with all the fierce commotion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rapture of the hunting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beneath, the Evil Spirits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay in ambush, waiting for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the treacherous ice beneath him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragged him downward to the bottom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried in the sand his body.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unktahee, the god of water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the god of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drowned him in the deep abysses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lake of Gitche Gumee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the headlands Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent forth such a wail of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a fearful lamentation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the bison paused to listen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wolves howled from the prairies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thunder in the distance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting answered "Baim-wawa!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his face with black he painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his robe his head he covered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his wigwam sat lamenting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven long weeks he sat lamenting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttering still this moan of sorrow:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead, the sweet musician!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of all singers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has gone from us forever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has moved a little nearer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Master of all music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Master of all singing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my brother, Chibiabos!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the melancholy fir-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved their dark green fans above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved their purple cones above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing with him to console him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingling with his lamentation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their complaining, their lamenting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Spring, and all the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked in vain for Chibiabos;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed the rivulet, Sebowisha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed the rushes in the meadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tree-tops sang the bluebird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead, the sweet musician!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wigwam sang the robin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead, the sweetest singer!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at night through all the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went the whippoorwill complaining,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wailing went the Wawonaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chibiabos! Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead, the sweet musician!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of all singers!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Medicine-men, the Medas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians, the Wabenos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to visit Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built a Sacred Lodge beside him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To appease him, to console him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked in silent, grave procession,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing each a pouch of healing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin of beaver, lynx, or otter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with magic roots and simples,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with very potent medicines.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard their steps approaching,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha ceased lamenting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called no more on Chibiabos;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught he questioned, naught he answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his mournful head uncovered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his face the mourning colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washed he slowly and in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly and in silence followed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward to the Sacred Wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There a magic drink they gave him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of Nahma-wusk, the spearmint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Wabeno-wusk, the yarrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roots of power, and herbs of healing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat their drums, and shook their rattles;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chanted singly and in chorus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystic songs like these, they chanted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I myself, myself! behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is the great Gray Eagle talking;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, ye white crows, come and hear him!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud-speaking thunder helps me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the unseen spirits help me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hear their voices calling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around the sky I hear them!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can blow you strong, my brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can heal you, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Way-ha-way!" the mystic chorus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends of mine are all the serpents!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear me shake my skin of hen-hawk!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahng, the white loon, I can kill him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can shoot your heart and kill it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can blow you strong, my brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can heal you, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Way-ha-way!" the mystic chorus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I myself, myself! the prophet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I speak the wigwam trembles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes the Sacred Lodge with terror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands unseen begin to shake it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walk, the sky I tread on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bends and makes a noise beneath me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can blow you strong, my brother!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise and speak, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi-au-ha!" replied the chorus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Way-ha-way!" the mystic chorus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they shook their medicine-pouches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the head of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced their medicine-dance around him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upstarting wild and haggard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a man from dreams awakened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was healed of all his madness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the clouds are swept from heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway from his brain departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his moody melancholy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ice is swept from rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway from his heart departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his sorrow and affliction.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they summoned Chibiabos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his grave beneath the waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sands of Gitche Gumee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned Hiawatha's brother.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so mighty was the magic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that cry and invocation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he heard it as he lay there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the Big-Sea-Water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sand he rose and listened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the music and the singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came, obedient to the summons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the doorway of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to enter they forbade him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a chink a coal they gave him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the door a burning fire-brand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruler in the Land of Spirits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruler o'er the dead, they made him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling him a fire to kindle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all those that died thereafter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camp-fires for their night encampments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their solitary journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of the Hereafter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the village of his childhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the homes of those who knew him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing silent through the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a smoke-wreath wafted sideways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly vanished Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he passed, the branches moved not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he trod, the grasses bent not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fallen leaves of last year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made no sound beneath his footstep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four whole days he journeyed onward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the pathway of the dead men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dead-man's strawberry feasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossed the melancholy river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the swinging log he crossed it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came unto the Lake of Silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Stone Canoe was carried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Islands of the Blessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of ghosts and shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that journey, moving slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many weary spirits saw he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panting under heavy burdens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laden with war-clubs, bows and arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robes of fur, and pots and kettles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with food that friends had given
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that solitary journey.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay! why do the living," said they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lay such heavy burdens on us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better were it to go naked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better were it to go fasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to bear such heavy burdens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our long and weary journey!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth then issued Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered eastward, wandered westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching men the use of simples
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the antidotes for poisons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cure of all diseases.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was first made known to mortals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the mystery of Medamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sacred art of healing.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAU-PUK-KEEWIS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, the handsome Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom the people called the Storm-Fool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vexed the village with disturbance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear of all his mischief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his flight from Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his wondrous transmigrations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the end of his adventures.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shores of Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shining Big-Sea-Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the lodge of Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was he who in his frenzy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirled these drifting sands together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, among the guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He so merrily and madly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced at Hiawatha's wedding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced the Beggar's Dance to please them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in search of new adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his lodge went Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came with speed into the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the young men all assembled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lodge of old Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to his monstrous stories,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his wonderful adventures.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was telling them the story
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Ojeeg, the Summer-Maker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he made a hole in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he climbed up into heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let out the summer-weather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perpetual, pleasant Summer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Otter first essayed it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Beaver, Lynx, and Badger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried in turn the great achievement,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the summit of the mountain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote their fists against the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote against the sky their foreheads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cracked the sky, but could not break it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Wolverine, uprising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made him ready for the encounter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent his knees down, like a squirrel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew his arms back, like a cricket.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once he leaped," said old Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once he leaped, and lo! above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent the sky, as ice in rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the waters rise beneath it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice he leaped, and lo! above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cracked the sky, as ice in rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the freshet is at highest!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice he leaped, and lo! above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the shattered sky asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he disappeared within it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ojeeg, the Fisher Weasel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bound went in behind him!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hark you!" shouted Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he entered at the doorway;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am tired of all this talking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired of old Iagoo's stories,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired of Hiawatha's wisdom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is something to amuse you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than this endless talking."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from out his pouch of wolf-skin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth he drew, with solemn manner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the game of Bowl and Counters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pugasaing, with thirteen pieces.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White on one side were they painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vermilion on the other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Kenabeeks or great serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Ininewug or wedge-men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One great war-club, Pugamaugun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one slender fish, the Keego,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four round pieces, Ozawabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three Sheshebwug or ducklings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were made of bone and painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All except the Ozawabeeks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were brass, on one side burnished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And were black upon the other.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a wooden bowl he placed them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook and jostled them together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw them on the ground before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus exclaiming and explaining:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red side up are all the pieces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one great Kenabeek standing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bright side of a brass piece,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a burnished Ozawabeek;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen tens and eight are counted."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again he shook the pieces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook and jostled them together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw them on the ground before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still exclaiming and explaining:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White are both the great Kenabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White the Ininewug, the wedge-men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red are all the other pieces;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five tens and an eight are counted."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he taught the game of hazard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus displayed it and explained it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running through its various chances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various changes, various meanings:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty curious eyes stared at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of eagerness stared at him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many games," said old Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many games of skill and hazard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I seen in different nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I played in different countries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who plays with old Iagoo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must have very nimble fingers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you think yourself so skilful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can beat you, Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can even give you lessons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your game of Bowl and Counters!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they sat and played together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the old men and the young men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played for dresses, weapons, wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played till midnight, played till morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played until the Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their treasures had despoiled them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the best of all their dresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirts of deer-skin, robes of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belts of wampum, crests of feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warlike weapons, pipes and pouches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty eyes glared wildly at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eyes of wolves glared at him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the lucky Pau-Puk-Keewis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my wigwam I am lonely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my wanderings and adventures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have need of a companion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fain would have a Meshinauwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An attendant and pipe-bearer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will venture all these winnings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these garments heaped about me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this wampum, all these feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a single throw will venture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All against the young man yonder!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was a youth of sixteen summers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was a nephew of Iagoo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face-in-a-Mist, the people called him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fire burns in a pipe-head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dusky red beneath the ashes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So beneath his shaggy eyebrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowed the eyes of old Iagoo.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh!" he answered very fiercely;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh!" they answered all and each one.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized the wooden bowl the old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closely in his bony fingers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clutched the fatal bowl, Onagon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook it fiercely and with fury,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the pieces ring together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he threw them down before him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red were both the great Kenabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red the Ininewug, the wedge-men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red the Sheshebwug, the ducklings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black the four brass Ozawabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White alone the fish, the Keego;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only five the pieces counted!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the smiling Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook the bowl and threw the pieces;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightly in the air he tossed them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they fell about him scattered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark and bright the Ozawabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red and white the other pieces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upright among the others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Ininewug was standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as crafty Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood alone among the players,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Five tens! mine the game is!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty eyes glared at him fiercely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eyes of wolves glared at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he turned and left the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed by his Meshinauwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the nephew of Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the tall and graceful stripling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in his arms the winnings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirts of deer-skin, robes of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belts of wampum, pipes and weapons.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carry them," said Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing with his fan of feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To my wigwam far to eastward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot and red with smoke and gambling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the eyes of Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he came forth to the freshness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the pleasant Summer morning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the birds were singing gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the streamlets flowing swiftly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heart of Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang with pleasure as the birds sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat with triumph like the streamlets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he wandered through the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early gray of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fan of turkey-feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his plumes and tufts of swan's down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he reached the farthest wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reached the lodge of Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent was it and deserted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one met him at the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one came to bid him welcome;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the birds were singing round it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out and round the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopping, singing, fluttering, feeding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And aloft upon the ridge-pole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat with fiery eyes, and, screaming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flapped his wings at Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are gone! the lodge is empty!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was spake Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart resolving mischief;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gone is wary Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone the silly Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone Nokomis, the old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lodge is left unguarded!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the neck he seized the raven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirled it round him like a rattle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a medicine-pouch he shook it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangled Kahgahgee, the raven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ridge-pole of the wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left its lifeless body hanging,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an insult to its master,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a taunt to Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a stealthy step he entered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the lodge in wild disorder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw the household things about him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piled together in confusion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowls of wood and earthen kettles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robes of buffalo and beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skins of otter, lynx, and ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an insult to Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a taunt to Minnehaha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then departed Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling, singing through the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling gayly to the squirrels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from hollow boughs above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropped their acorn-shells upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing gayly to the wood birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from out the leafy darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered with a song as merry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he climbed the rocky headlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking o'er the Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched himself upon their summit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting full of mirth and mischief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return of Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched upon his back he lay there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far below him plashed the waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plashed and washed the dreamy waters;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far above him swam the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swam the dizzy, dreamy heavens;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round him hovered, fluttered, rustled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha's mountain chickens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flock-wise swept and wheeled about him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost brushed him with their pinions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he killed them as he lay there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaughtered them by tens and twenties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw their bodies down the headland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw them on the beach below him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at length Kayoshk, the sea-gull,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched upon a crag above them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted: "It is Pau-Puk-Keewis!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is slaying us by hundreds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send a message to our brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tidings send to Hiawatha!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE HUNTING OF PAU-PUK-KEEWIS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of wrath was Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came into the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the people in confusion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard of all the misdemeanors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the malice and the mischief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard his breath came through his nostrils,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words of anger and resentment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot and humming, like a hornet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will slay this Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slay this mischief-maker!" said he.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so long and wide the world is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so rude and rough the way is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my wrath shall not attain him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my vengeance shall not reach him!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in swift pursuit departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha and the hunters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the trail of Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest, where he passed it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the headlands where he rested;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they found not Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in the trampled grasses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whortleberry-bushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the couch where he had rested,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the impress of his body.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lowlands far beneath them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Muskoday, the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pau-Puk-Keewis, turning backward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a gesture of defiance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a gesture of derision;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And aloud cried Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the summit of the mountains:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so long and wide the world is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so rude and rough the way is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my wrath shall overtake you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my vengeance shall attain you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over rock and over river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through bush, and brake, and forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an antelope he bounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he came unto a streamlet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a streamlet still and tranquil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had overflowed its margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a dam made by the beavers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a pond of quiet water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where knee-deep the trees were standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the water lilies floated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the rushes waved and whispered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dam of trunks and branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through whose chinks the water spouted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er whose summit flowed the streamlet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bottom rose the beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked with two great eyes of wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes that seemed to ask a question,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the stranger, Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowed the bright and silvery water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he spake unto the beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile he spake in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O my friend Ahmeek, the beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool and pleasant is the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me dive into the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me rest there in your lodges;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change me, too, into a beaver!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautiously replied the beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reserve he thus made answer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me first consult the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the other beavers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down he sank into the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavily sank he, as a stone sinks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down among the leaves and branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown and matted at the bottom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spouted through the chinks below him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dashed upon the stones beneath him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread serene and calm before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sunshine and the shadows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell in flecks and gleams upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell in little shining patches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the waving, rustling branches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bottom rose the beavers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently above the surface
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose one head and then another,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the pond seemed full of beavers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of black and shining faces.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beavers Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake entreating, said in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very pleasant is your dwelling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my friends! and safe from danger;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you not, with all your cunning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your wisdom and contrivance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change me, too, into a beaver?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" replied Ahmeek, the beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the King of all the beavers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let yourself slide down among us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down into the tranquil water."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down into the pond among them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black became his shirt of deer-skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black his moccasins and leggings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a broad black tail behind him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread his fox-tails and his fringes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was changed into a beaver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Make me large," said Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Make me large and make me larger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larger than the other beavers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the beaver chief responded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When our lodge below you enter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our wigwam we will make you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten times larger than the others."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus into the clear, brown water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the bottom covered over
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the trunks of trees and branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoards of food against the winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piles and heaps against the famine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the lodge with arching doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading into spacious chambers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here they made him large and larger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made him largest of the beavers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten times larger than the others.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shall be our ruler," said they;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chief and King of all the beavers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not long had Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat in state among the beavers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there came a voice of warning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the watchman at his station
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the water-flags and lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Here Is Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha with his hunters!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they heard a cry above them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard a shouting and a tramping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard a crashing and a rushing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the water round and o'er them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank and sucked away in eddies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they knew their dam was broken.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lodge's roof the hunters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped, and broke it all asunder;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamed the sunshine through the crevice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang the beavers through the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid themselves in deeper water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the channel of the streamlet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mighty Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not pass beneath the doorway;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was puffed with pride and feeding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was swollen like a bladder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the roof looked Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried aloud, "O Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vain are all your craft and cunning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vain your manifold disguises!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I know you, Pau-Puk-Keewis!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their clubs they beat and bruised him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat to death poor Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pounded him as maize is pounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his skull was crushed to pieces.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six tall hunters, lithe and limber,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore him home on poles and branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore the body of the beaver;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ghost, the Jeebi in him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought and felt as Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still lived on as Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it fluttered, strove, and struggled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waving hither, waving thither,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the curtains of a wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggle with their thongs of deer-skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wintry wind is blowing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it drew itself together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it rose up from the body,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it took the form and features
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanishing into the forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wary Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the figure ere it vanished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the form of Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glide into the soft blue shadow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the pine-trees of the forest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the squares of white beyond it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward an opening in the forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wind it rushed and panted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending all the boughs before it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind it, as the rain comes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the steps of Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a lake with many islands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the breathless Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where among the water-lilies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pishnekuh, the brant, were sailing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the tufts of rushes floating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steering through the reedy islands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now their broad black beaks they lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they plunged beneath the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they darkened in the shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they brightened in the sunshine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pishnekuh!" cried Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pishnekuh! my brothers!" said he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change me to a brant with plumage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a shining neck and feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make me large, and make me larger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten times larger than the others."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway to a brant they changed him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two huge and dusky pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bosom smooth and rounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bill like two great paddles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made him larger than the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten times larger than the largest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as, shouting from the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore stood Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up they rose with cry and clamor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a whir and beat of pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose up from the reedy Islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the water-flags and lilies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they said to Pau-Puk-Keewis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In your flying, look not downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take good heed and look not downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest some strange mischance should happen,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest some great mishap befall you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast and far they fled to northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast and far through mist and sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fed among the moors and fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slept among the reeds and rushes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morrow as they journeyed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buoyed and lifted by the South-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wafted onward by the South-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing fresh and strong behind them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose a sound of human voices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose a clamor from beneath them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lodges of a village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the people miles beneath them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the people of the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the flock of brant with wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the wings of Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flapping far up in the ether,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broader than two doorway curtains.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pau-Puk-Keewis heard the shouting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew the voice of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew the outcry of Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, forgetful of the warning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew his neck in, and looked downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wind that blew behind him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught his mighty fan of feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent him wheeling, whirling downward!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in vain did Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggle to regain his balance!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirling round and round and downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beheld in turn the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in turn the flock above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the village coming nearer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the flock receding farther,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the voices growing louder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the shouting and the laughter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw no more the flocks above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only saw the earth beneath him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead out of the empty heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead among the shouting people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a heavy sound and sullen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the brant with broken pinions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his soul, his ghost, his shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still survived as Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took again the form and features
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the handsome Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again went rushing onward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed fast by Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying: "Not so wide the world is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long and rough the way is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my wrath shall overtake you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my vengeance shall attain you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so near he came, so near him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That his hand was stretched to seize him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand to seize and hold him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirled and spun about in circles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanned the air into a whirlwind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced the dust and leaves about him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amid the whirling eddies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang into a hollow oak-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed himself into a serpent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gliding out through root and rubbish.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his right hand Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote amain the hollow oak-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rent it into shreds and splinters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left it lying there in fragments.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in vain; for Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again in human figure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full in sight ran on before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sped away in gust and whirlwind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shores of Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward by the Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came unto the rocky headlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking over lake and landscape.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Old Man of the Mountain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the Manito of Mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened wide his rocky doorways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened wide his deep abysses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving Pau-Puk-Keewis shelter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his caverns dark and dreary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bidding Pau-Puk-Keewis welcome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his gloomy lodge of sandstone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There without stood Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the doorways closed against him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote great caverns in the sandstone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried aloud in tones of thunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open! I am Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Old Man of the Mountain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened not, and made no answer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the silent crags of sandstone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gloomy rock abysses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he raised his hands to heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called imploring on the tempest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called Waywassimo, the lightning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thunder, Annemeekee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they came with night and darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping down the Big-Sea-Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the distant Thunder Mountains;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trembling Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the footsteps of the thunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the red eyes of the lightning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was afraid, and crouched and trembled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Waywassimo, the lightning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote the doorways of the caverns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his war-club smote the doorways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote the jutting crags of sandstone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thunder, Annemeekee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted down into the caverns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Where is Pau-Puk-Keewis!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the crags fell, and beneath them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead among the rocky ruins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the handsome Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slain in his own human figure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ended were his wild adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ended were his tricks and gambols,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ended all his craft and cunning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ended all his mischief-making,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his gambling and his dancing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his wooing of the maidens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the noble Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took his soul, his ghost, his shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake and said: "O Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never more in human figure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall you search for new adventures;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never more with jest and laughter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But above there in the heavens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall soar and sail in circles;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will change you to an eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Keneu, the great war-eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief of all the fowls with feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief of Hiawatha's chickens."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the name of Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingers still among the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingers still among the singers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among the story-tellers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Winter, when the snow-flakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirl in eddies round the lodges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind in gusty tumult
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the smoke-flue pipes and whistles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There," they cry, "comes Pau-Puk-Keewis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dancing through the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is gathering in his harvest!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE DEATH OF KWASIND

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far and wide among the nations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the name and fame of Kwasind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man dared to strive with Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man could compete with Kwasind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mischievous Puk-Wudjies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They the envious Little People,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They the fairies and the pygmies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plotted and conspired against him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this hateful Kwasind," said they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this great, outrageous fellow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes on thus a little longer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tearing everything he touches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rending everything to pieces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the world with wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What becomes of the Puk-Wudjies?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will care for the Puk-Wudjies?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will tread us down like mushrooms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive us all into the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give our bodies to be eaten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the wicked Nee-ba-naw-baigs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Spirits of the water!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the angry Little People
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All conspired against the Strong Man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All conspired to murder Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, to rid the world of Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audacious, overbearing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heartless, haughty, dangerous Kwasind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this wondrous strength of Kwasind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his crown alone was seated;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his crown too was his weakness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There alone could he be wounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere else could weapon pierce him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere else could weapon harm him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even there the only weapon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That could wound him, that could slay him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the seed-cone of the pine-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the blue cone of the fir-tree.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was Kwasind's fatal secret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known to no man among mortals;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cunning Little People,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Puk-Wudjies, knew the secret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew the only way to kill him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they gathered cones together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathered seed-cones of the pine-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathered blue cones of the fir-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woods by Taquamenaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought them to the river's margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaped them in great piles together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the red rocks from the margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jutting overhang the river.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There they lay in wait for Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The malicious Little People.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was an afternoon in Summer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very hot and still the air was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very smooth the gliding river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless the sleeping shadows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insects glistened in the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insects skated on the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the drowsy air with buzzing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a far resounding war-cry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the river came the Strong Man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his birch canoe came Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating slowly down the current
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sluggish Taquamenaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very languid with the weather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very sleepy with the silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the overhanging branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tassels of the birch-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his airy hosts surrounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His invisible attendants,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a burnished Dush-kwo-ne-she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a dragon-fly, he hovered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the drowsy head of Kwasind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his ear there came a murmur
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of waves upon a sea-shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of far-off tumbling waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of winds among the pine-trees;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he felt upon his forehead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blows of little airy war-clubs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wielded by the slumbrous legions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of some one breathing on him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first blow of their war-clubs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell a drowsiness on Kwasind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the second blow they smote him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless his paddle rested;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the third, before his vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reeled the landscape into darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very sound asleep was Kwasind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he floated down the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a blind man seated upright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated down the Taquamenaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the trembling birch-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the wooded headlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the war encampment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the pygmies, the Puk-Wudjies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There they stood, all armed and waiting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurled the pine-cones down upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck him on his brawny shoulders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his crown defenceless struck him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death to Kwasind!" was the sudden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War-cry of the Little People.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he sideways swayed and tumbled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sideways fell into the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged beneath the sluggish water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headlong, as an otter plunges;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the birch canoe, abandoned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifted empty down the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom upward swerved and drifted:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing more was seen of Kwasind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the memory of the Strong Man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingered long among the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whenever through the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raged and roared the wintry tempest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the branches, tossed and troubled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creaked and groaned and split asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kwasind!" cried they; "that is Kwasind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is gathering in his fire-wood!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE GHOSTS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never stoops the soaring vulture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his quarry in the desert,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sick or wounded bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But another vulture, watching
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his high aerial look-out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees the downward plunge, and follows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a third pursues the second,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the invisible ether,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a speck, and then a vulture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the air is dark with pinions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So disasters come not singly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as if they watched and waited,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanning one another's motions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first descends, the others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow, follow, gathering flock-wise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round their victim, sick and wounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a shadow, then a sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the air is dark with anguish.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, o'er all the dreary North-land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mighty Peboan, the Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing on the lakes and rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into stone had changed their waters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his hair he shook the snow-flakes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the plains were strewn with whiteness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One uninterrupted level,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if, stooping, the Creator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hand had smoothed them over.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest, wide and wailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roamed the hunter on his snow-shoes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the village worked the women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pounded maize, or dressed the deer-skin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the young men played together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ice the noisy ball-play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plain the dance of snow-shoes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One dark evening, after sundown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her wigwam Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat with old Nokomis, waiting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the steps of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward from the hunt returning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their faces gleamed the firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painting them with streaks of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glimmered like the watery moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glistened like the sun in water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind them crouched their shadows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corners of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the smoke in wreaths above them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbed and crowded through the smoke-flue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the curtain of the doorway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From without was slowly lifted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighter glowed the fire a moment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a moment swerved the smoke-wreath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As two women entered softly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed the doorway uninvited,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without word of salutation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without sign of recognition,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat down in the farthest corner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouching low among the shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their aspect and their garments,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers seemed they in the village;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very pale and haggard were they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they sat there sad and silent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling, cowering with the shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it the wind above the smoke-flue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muttering down into the wigwam?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it the owl, the Koko-koho,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hooting from the dismal forest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure a voice said in the silence:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are corpses clad in garments,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are ghosts that come to haunt you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Hereafter!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward now came Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his hunting in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the snow upon his tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the red deer on his shoulders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feet of Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down he threw his lifeless burden;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobler, handsomer she thought him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when first he came to woo her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First threw down the deer before her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a token of his wishes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a promise of the future.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned and saw the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cowering, crouching with the shadows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said within himself, "Who are they?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What strange guests has Minnehaha?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he questioned not the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only spake to bid them welcome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his lodge, his food, his fireside.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evening meal was ready,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the deer had been divided,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the pallid guests, the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springing from among the shadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized upon the choicest portions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized the white fat of the roebuck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set apart for Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the wife of Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without asking, without thanking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagerly devoured the morsels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitted back among the shadows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a word spake Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a motion made Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a gesture Laughing Water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a change came o'er their features;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Minnehaha softly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered, saying, "They are famished;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them do what best delights them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them eat, for they are famished."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a daylight dawned and darkened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a night shook off the daylight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the pine shakes off the snow-flakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the midnight of its branches;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day the guests unmoving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat there silent in the wigwam;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by night, in storm or starlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth they went into the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing fire-wood to the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing pine-cones for the burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always sad and always silent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whenever Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from fishing or from hunting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evening meal was ready,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the food had been divided,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gliding from their darksome corner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the pallid guests, the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized upon the choicest portions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set aside for Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And without rebuke or question
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitted back among the shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never once had Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a word or look reproved them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never once had old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a gesture of impatience;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never once had Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shown resentment at the outrage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All had they endured in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the rights of guest and stranger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the virtue of free-giving,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a look might not be lessened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a word might not be broken.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once at midnight Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever wakeful, ever watchful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wigwam, dimly lighted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the brands that still were burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the glimmering, flickering firelight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard a sighing, oft repeated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard a sobbing, as of sorrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his couch rose Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his shaggy hides of bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushed aside the deer-skin curtain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the pallid guests, the shadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting upright on their couches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping in the silent midnight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said: "O guests! why is it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That your hearts are so afflicted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you sob so in the midnight?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has perchance the old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has my wife, my Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wronged or grieved you by unkindness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed in hospitable duties?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the shadows ceased from weeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceased from sobbing and lamenting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they said, with gentle voices:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are ghosts of the departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Souls of those who once were with you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the realms of Chibiabos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither have we come to try you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither have we come to warn you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cries of grief and lamentation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach us in the Blessed Islands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cries of anguish from the living,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling back their friends departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadden us with useless sorrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore have we come to try you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows us, no one heeds us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are but a burden to you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we see that the departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have no place among the living.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think of this, O Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak of it to all the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That henceforward and forever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They no more with lamentations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadden the souls of the departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Islands of the Blessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not lay such heavy burdens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the graves of those you bury,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not such weight of furs and wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not such weight of pots and kettles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the spirits faint beneath them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only give them food to carry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only give them fire to light them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four days is the spirit's journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of ghosts and shadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four its lonely night encampments;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four times must their fires be lighted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the dead are buried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let a fire, as night approaches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four times on the grave be kindled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the soul upon its journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May not lack the cheerful firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May not grope about in darkness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell, noble Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put you to the trial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the proof have put your patience,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the insult of our presence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the outrage of our actions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found you great and noble.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fail not in the greater trial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint not in the harder struggle."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they ceased, a sudden darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell and filled the silent wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha heard a rustle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of garments trailing by him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the curtain of the doorway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted by a hand he saw not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt the cold breath of the night air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment saw the starlight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he saw the ghosts no longer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw no more the wandering spirits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Hereafter.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE FAMINE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the long and dreary Winter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the cold and cruel Winter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever thicker, thicker, thicker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froze the ice on lake and river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever deeper, deeper, deeper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the snow o'er all the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the covering snow, and drifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest, round the village.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly from his buried wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the hunter force a passage;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens and his snow-shoes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly walked he through the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought for bird or beast and found none,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw no track of deer or rabbit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snow beheld no footprints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ghastly, gleaming forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell, and could not rise from weakness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perished there from cold and hunger.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the famine and the fever!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the wasting of the famine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the blasting of the fever!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the wailing of the children!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the anguish of the women!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the earth was sick and famished;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry was the air around them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry was the sky above them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hungry stars in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eyes of wolves glared at them!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into Hiawatha's wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came two other guests, as silent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ghosts were, and as gloomy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited not to be invited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not parley at the doorway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat there without word of welcome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the seat of Laughing Water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked with haggard eyes and hollow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the face of Laughing Water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the foremost said: "Behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Famine, Bukadawin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other said: "Behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Fever, Ahkosewin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lovely Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuddered as they looked upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuddered at the words they uttered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down on her bed in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid her face, but made no answer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay there trembling, freezing, burning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the looks they cast upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fearful words they uttered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into the empty forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed the maddened Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart was deadly sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his face a stony firmness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his brow the sweat of anguish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started, but it froze and fell not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in furs and armed for hunting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mighty bow of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his quiver full of arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the vast and vacant forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his snow-shoes strode he forward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gitche Manito, the Mighty!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried he with his face uplifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that bitter hour of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give your children food, O father!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give us food, or we must perish!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me food for Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my dying Minnehaha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the far-resounding forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest vast and vacant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang that cry of desolation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there came no other answer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the echo of his crying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the echo of the woodlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Minnehaha! Minnehaha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long roved Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that melancholy forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the shadow of whose thickets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant days of Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that ne'er forgotten Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had brought his young wife homeward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Dacotahs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the birds sang in the thickets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the streamlets laughed and glistened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the air was full of fragrance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lovely Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said with voice that did not tremble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will follow you, my husband!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wigwam with Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those gloomy guests that watched her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Famine and the Fever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was lying, the Beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, the dying Minnehaha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hark!" she said; "I hear a rushing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear a roaring and a rushing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the Falls of Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling to me from a distance!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, my child!" said old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the night-wind in the pine-trees!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look!" she said; "I see my father
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing lonely at his doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckoning to me from his wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, my child!" said old Nokomis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the smoke, that waves and beckons!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" said she, "the eyes of Pauguk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glare upon me in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can feel his icy fingers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasping mine amid the darkness!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha! Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the desolate Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far away amid the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miles away among the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard that sudden cry of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the voice of Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling to him in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hiawatha! Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over snow-fields waste and pathless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under snow-encumbered branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward hurried Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Nokomis moaning, wailing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wahonowin! Wahonowin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that I had perished for you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that I were dead as you are!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahonowin! Wahonowin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he rushed into the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the old Nokomis slowly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocking to and fro and moaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw his lovely Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying dead and cold before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his bursting heart within him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttered such a cry of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the forest moaned and shuddered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the very stars in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook and trembled with his anguish.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he sat down, still and speechless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bed of Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feet of Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At those willing feet, that never
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More would lightly run to meet him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never more would lightly follow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands his face he covered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven long days and nights he sat there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if in a swoon he sat there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless, motionless, unconscious
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the daylight or the darkness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they buried Minnehaha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snow a grave they made her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest deep and darksome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the moaning hemlocks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothed her in her richest garments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped her in her robes of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered her with snow, like ermine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they buried Minnehaha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at night a fire was lighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her grave four times was kindled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her soul upon its journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Islands of the Blessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his doorway Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw it burning in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his sleepless bed uprising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bed of Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood and watched it at the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it might not be extinguished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might not leave her in the darkness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" said he, "Minnehaha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, O my Laughing Water!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my heart is buried with you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my thoughts go onward with you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come not back again to labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come not back again to suffer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Famine and the Fever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear the heart and waste the body.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon my task will be completed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon your footsteps I shall follow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Islands of the Blessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Land of the Hereafter!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his lodge beside a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close beside a frozen river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat an old man, sad and lonely.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White his hair was as a snow-drift;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dull and low his fire was burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old man shook and trembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folded in his Waubewyon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his tattered white-skin-wrapper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing nothing but the tempest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it roared along the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing nothing but the snow-storm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it whirled and hissed and drifted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the coals were white with ashes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fire was slowly dying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young man, walking lightly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the open doorway entered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red with blood of youth his cheeks were,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft his eyes, as stars in Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound his forehead was with grasses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound and plumed with scented grasses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his lips a smile of beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the lodge with sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his hand a bunch of blossoms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the lodge with sweetness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, my son!" exclaimed the old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy are my eyes to see you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit here on the mat beside me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit here by the dying embers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pass the night together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me of your strange adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lands where you have travelled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell you of my prowess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my many deeds of wonder."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his pouch he drew his peace-pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very old and strangely fashioned;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of red stone was the pipe-head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stem a reed with feathers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the pipe with bark of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placed a burning coal upon it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave it to his guest, the stranger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And began to speak in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I blow my breath about me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I breathe upon the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless are all the rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard as stone becomes the water!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the young man answered, smiling:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I blow my breath about me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I breathe upon the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers spring up o'er all the meadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing, onward rush the rivers!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I shake my hoary tresses,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the old man darkly frowning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the land with snow is covered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the leaves from all the branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall and fade and die and wither,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I breathe, and lo! they are not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the waters and the marshes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise the wild goose and the heron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly away to distant regions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I speak, and lo! they are not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where'er my footsteps wander,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wild beasts of the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide themselves in holes and caverns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the earth becomes as flintstone!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I shake my flowing ringlets,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the young man, softly laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Showers of rain fall warm and welcome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plants lift up their heads rejoicing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back into their lakes and marshes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come the wild goose and the heron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward shoots the arrowy swallow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing the bluebird and the robin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where'er my footsteps wander,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the meadows wave with blossoms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the woodlands ring with music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the trees are dark with foliage!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they spake, the night departed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the distant realms of Wabun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his shining lodge of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a warrior robed and painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the sun, and said, "Behold me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gheezis, the great sun, behold me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the old man's tongue was speechless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the air grew warm and pleasant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon the wigwam sweetly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the bluebird and the robin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stream began to murmur,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a scent of growing grasses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the lodge was gently wafted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Segwun, the youthful stranger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More distinctly in the daylight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the icy face before him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Peboan, the Winter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his eyes the tears were flowing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from melting lakes the streamlets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his body shrunk and dwindled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the shouting sun ascended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till into the air it faded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till into the ground it vanished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the young man saw before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hearth-stone of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the fire had smoked and smouldered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the earliest flower of Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the Beauty of the Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the Miskodeed in blossom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was that in the North-land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that unheard-of coldness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That intolerable Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Spring with all its splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its birds and all its blossoms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its flowers and leaves and grasses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing on the wind to northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying in great flocks, like arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like huge arrows shot through heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed the swan, the Mahnahbezee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking almost as a man speaks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in long lines waving, bending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a bow-string snapped asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the white goose, Waw-be-wawa;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in pairs, or singly flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahng the loon, with clangorous pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grouse, the Mushkodasa.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thickets and the meadows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piped the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the summit of the lodges
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the covert of the pine-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooed the pigeon, the Omemee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sorrowing Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless in his infinite sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard their voices calling to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went forth from his gloomy doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood and gazed into the heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed upon the earth and waters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his wanderings far to eastward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the regions of the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shining land of Wabun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward now returned Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great traveller, the great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of new and strange adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvels many and many wonders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people of the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened to him as he told them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his marvellous adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing answered him in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh! it is indeed Iagoo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one else beholds such wonders!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had seen, he said, a water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bigger than the Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broader than the Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitter so that none could drink it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each other looked the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked the women at each other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled, and said, "It cannot be so!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaw!" they said, it cannot be so!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er it, said he, o'er this water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came a great canoe with pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A canoe with wings came flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bigger than a grove of pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taller than the tallest tree-tops!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old men and the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked and tittered at each other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaw!" they said, "we don't believe it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its mouth, he said, to greet him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came Waywassimo, the lightning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the thunder, Annemeekee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the warriors and the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed aloud at poor Iagoo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaw!" they said, "what tales you tell us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In it, said he, came a people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great canoe with pinions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came, he said, a hundred warriors;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted white were all their faces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with hair their chins were covered!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the warriors and the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed and shouted in derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the ravens on the tree-tops,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the crows upon the hemlocks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaw!" they said, "what lies you tell us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think that we believe them!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Hiawatha laughed not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he gravely spake and answered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their jeering and their jesting:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True is all Iagoo tells us;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen it in a vision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen the great canoe with pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen the people with white faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen the coming of this bearded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People of the wooden vessel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the regions of the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shining land of Wabun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gitche Manito, the Mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Spirit, the Creator,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends them hither on his errand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends them to us with his message.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheresoe'er they move, before them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swarms the stinging fly, the Ahmo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swarms the bee, the honey-maker;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheresoe'er they tread, beneath them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs a flower unknown among us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs the White-man's Foot in blossom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us welcome, then, the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail them as our friends and brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heart's right hand of friendship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give them when they come to see us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the Mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said this to me in my vision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I beheld, too, in that vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the secrets of the future,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the distant days that shall be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beheld the westward marches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the unknown, crowded nations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the land was full of people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restless, struggling, toiling, striving,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking many tongues, yet feeling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one heart-beat in their bosoms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woodlands rang their axes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoked their towns in all the valleys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over all the lakes and rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed their great canoes of thunder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then a darker, drearier vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed before me, vague and cloud-like;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beheld our nation scattered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All forgetful of my counsels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weakened, warring with each other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the remnants of our people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping westward, wild and woful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the cloud-rack of a tempest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the withered leaves of Autumn!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shore of Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shining Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant Summer morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha stood and waited.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the air was full of freshness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the earth was bright and joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before him, through the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward toward the neighboring forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed in golden swarms the Ahmo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed the bees, the honey-makers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burning, singing in the sunshine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright above him shone the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level spread the lake before him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its bosom leaped the sturgeon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkling, flashing in the sunshine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its margin the great forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood reflected in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every tree-top had its shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless beneath the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the brow of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone was every trace of sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fog from off the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the mist from off the meadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile of joy and triumph,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a look of exultation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of one who in a vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees what is to be, but is not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood and waited Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the sun his hands were lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the palms spread out against it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And between the parted fingers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the sunshine on his features,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flecked with light his naked shoulders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it falls and flecks an oak-tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the rifted leaves and branches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the water floating, flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something in the hazy distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something in the mists of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loomed and lifted from the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now seemed floating, now seemed flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming nearer, nearer, nearer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it Shingebis the diver?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the pelican, the Shada?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the white goose, Waw-be-wawa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the water dripping, flashing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its glossy neck and feathers?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was neither goose nor diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither pelican nor heron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the water floating, flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the shining mist of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a birch canoe with paddles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising, sinking on the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dripping, flashing in the sunshine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And within it came a people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the distant land of Wabun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the farthest realms of morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the Priest of Prayer, the Pale-face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his guides and his companions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the noble Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hands aloft extended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held aloft in sign of welcome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited, full of exultation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the birch canoe with paddles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grated on the shining pebbles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stranded on the sandy margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cross upon his bosom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landed on the sandy margin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the joyous Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried aloud and spake in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful is the sun, O strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you come so far to see us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our town in peace awaits you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our doors stand open for you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall enter all our wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the heart's right hand we give you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never bloomed the earth so gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never shone the sun so brightly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to-day they shine and blossom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you come so far to see us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never was our lake so tranquil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor so free from rocks, and sand-bars;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your birch canoe in passing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has removed both rock and sand-bar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never before had our tobacco
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a sweet and pleasant flavor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never the broad leaves of our cornfields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were so beautiful to look on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they seem to us this morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you come so far to see us!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Black-Robe chief made answer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stammered in his speech a little,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking words yet unfamiliar:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peace be with you, Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace be with you and your people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace of prayer, and peace of pardon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace of Christ, and joy of Mary!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the generous Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led the strangers to his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated them on skins of bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated them on skins of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the careful old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought them food in bowls of basswood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water brought in birchen dippers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the calumet, the peace-pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled and lighted for their smoking.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the old men of the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the warriors of the nation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians, the Wabenos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Medicine-men, the Medas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to bid the strangers welcome;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is well", they said, "O brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you come so far to see us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a circle round the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their pipes they sat in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting to behold the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting to receive their message;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wigwam came to greet them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stammering in his speech a little,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking words yet unfamiliar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is well," they said, "O brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you come so far to see us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told his message to the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told the purport of his mission,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told them of the Virgin Mary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her blessed Son, the Saviour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How in distant lands and ages
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had lived on earth as we do;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he fasted, prayed, and labored;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Jews, the tribe accursed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mocked him, scourged him, crucified him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he rose from where they laid him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked again with his disciples,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ascended into heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chiefs made answer, saying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have listened to your message,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard your words of wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will think on what you tell us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well for us, O brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you come so far to see us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they rose up and departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one homeward to his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the young men and the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told the story of the strangers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom the Master of Life had sent them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shining land of Wabun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy with the heat and silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew the afternoon of Summer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a drowsy sound the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered round the sultry wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sound of sleep the water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rippled on the beach below it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the guests of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary with the heat of Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slumbered in the sultry wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly o'er the simmering landscape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the evening's dusk and coolness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the long and level sunbeams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot their spears into the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking through its shields of shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed into each secret ambush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searched each thicket, dingle, hollow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the guests of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slumbered in the silent wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his place rose Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade farewell to old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake in whispers, spake in this wise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not wake the guests, that slumbered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going, O Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a long and distant journey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the portals of the Sunset.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the regions of the home-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these guests I leave behind me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your watch and ward I leave them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See that never harm comes near them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See that never fear molests them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never danger nor suspicion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never want of food or shelter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lodge of Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into the village went he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade farewell to all the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade farewell to all the young men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake persuading, spake in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going, O my people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a long and distant journey;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many moons and many winters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will have come, and will have vanished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere I come again to see you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my guests I leave behind me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to their words of wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the truth they tell you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Master of Life has sent them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of light and morning!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore stood Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned and waved his hand at parting;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the clear and luminous water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launched his birch canoe for sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the pebbles of the margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoved it forth into the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered to it, "Westward! westward!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with speed it darted forward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the evening sun descending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the clouds on fire with redness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned the broad sky, like a prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left upon the level water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One long track and trail of splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down whose stream, as down a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward, westward Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed into the fiery sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed into the purple vapors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed into the dusk of evening:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people from the margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched him floating, rising, sinking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the birch canoe seemed lifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High into that sea of splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it sank into the vapors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the new moon slowly, slowly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking in the purple distance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they said, "Farewell forever!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the forests, dark and lonely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved through all their depths of darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the waves upon the margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising, rippling on the pebbles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobbed, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her haunts among the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screamed, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus departed Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha the Beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glory of the sunset,.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the purple mists of evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the regions of the home-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Islands of the Blessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Land of the Hereafter!

<p> You say that father writes a lot of books, but what he writes I don't understand.<br> He was reading to you all the evening, but could you really make out what he meant?<br> What nice stories, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father write like that, I wonder?<br> Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses?<br> Has he forgotten them all?<br> Often when he gets late for his bath you have to go and call him an hundred times.<br> You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.<br> Father always plays at making books.<br> If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me, "what a naughty child!"<br> If I make the slightest noise, you say, "Don't you see that father's at his work?"<br> What's the fun of always writing and writing?<br> When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does,--a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,--why do you get cross with me, then, mother?<br> You never say a word when father writes.<br> When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind at all.<br> But if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say, "Child, how troublesome you are!"<br> What do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all over on both sides?</p>

<p>The wild hawk to the wind-swept sky,<br> The deer to the wholesome wold,<br> And the heart of a man to the heart of a maid,<br> As it was in the days of old.<br> _Gypsy Song._ </p><p>SCENE.--_Interior of_ MISS MINNIE THREEGAN'S _bedroom at Simla._ MISS THREEGAN, _in window-seat, turning over a drawerful of things._ MISS EMMA DEERCOURT, _bosom-friend, who has come to spend the day, sitting on the bed, manipulating the bodice of a ballroom frock and a bunch of artificial lilies of the valley_. _Time,_ 5.30 P. M. _on a hot May afternoon._ </p><p>MISS DEERCOURT. And _he_ said: 'I shall _never_ forget this dance,' and, of course, I said: 'Oh! how _can_ you be so silly!' Do you think he meant anything, dear? </p><p>MISS THREEGAN. (<i>Extracting long lavender silk stocking from the rubbish.</i>) You know him better than _I_ do. </p><p>MISS D. Oh, _do_ be sympathetic, Minnie! I'm _sure_ he does. At least I _would_ be sure if he wasn't always riding with that odious Mrs. Hagan. </p><p>MISS T. I suppose so. How _does_ one manage to dance through one's heels first? Look at this--isn't it shameful? (<i>Spreads stocking-heel on open hand for inspection</i>) </p><p>MISS D. Never mind that! You can't mend it. Help me with this hateful bodice, I've run the string _so_, and I've run the string _so_, and I can't make the fulness come right. Where would you put this? (<i>Waves lilies of the valley.</i>) </p><p>MISS T. As high up on the shoulder as possible. </p><p>MISS D. Am I quite tall enough? I know it makes May Olger look lop-sided. </p><p>MISS T. Yes, but May hasn't your shoulders. Hers are like a hock-bottle. </p><p>BEARER. (<i>Rapping at door.</i>) Captain Sahib _aya._ </p><p>MISS D. (<i>Jumping up wildly, and hunting for body, which she has discarded owing to the heat of the day.</i>) Captain Sahib! What Captain Sahib? Oh, good gracious, and I'm only half dressed! Well, I shan't bother. </p><p>MISS T. (<i>Calmly.</i>) You needn't. It isn't for us. That's Captain Gadsby. He is going for a ride with Mamma. He generally comes five days out of the seven. </p><p>AGONISED VOICE. (<i>From an inner apartment.</i>) Minnie, run out and give Captain Gadsby some tea, and tell him I shall be ready in ten minutes; and, O Minnie, come to me an instant, there's a dear girl! </p><p>MISS T. Oh, bother! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Very well, Mamma. </p><p>_Exit, and reappears, after five minutes, flushed, and rubbing her fingers._ </p><p>MISS D. You look pink. What has happened? </p><p>MISS T. (<i>In a stage whisper.</i>) A twenty-four-inch waist, and she won't let it out. Where _are_ my bangles? (<i>Rummages on the toilet-table, and dabs at her hair with a brush in the interval.</i>) </p><p>MISS D. Who is this Captain Gadsby? I don't think I've met him. </p><p>MISS T. You _must_ have. He belongs to the Harrar set. I've danced with him, but I've never talked to him. He's a big yellow man, just like a newly-hatched chicken, with an e-normous moustache. He walks like this (<i>imitates Cavalry swagger</i>), and he goes 'Ha-Hmmm!' deep down in his throat when he can't think of anything to say. Mamma likes him. I don't. </p><p>MISS D. (<i>Abstractedly</i>) Does he wax his moustache? </p><p>MISS T. (<i>Busy with powder-puff_.} Yes, I think so. Why? </i></p><p><i>MISS D. (<i>Bending oner the bodice and sewing furiously</i>) Oh, nothing--only-- </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Sternly</i>) Only what? Out with it, Emma. </i></p><p><i>MISS D. Well, May Olger--she's engaged to Mr. Charteris, you know--said--Promise you won't repeat this? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Yes, I promise. What did she say? </i></p><p><i>MISS D. That--that being kissed (<i>with a rush</i>) by a man who _didn't_ wax his moustache was--like eating an egg without salt. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>At her full height, with crushing scorn</i>) May Olger is a horrid, nasty _Thing_, and you can tell her I said so. I'm glad she doesn't belong to my set--I must go and feed this _man!_ Do I look presentable? </i></p><p><i>MISS D. Yes, perfectly. Be quick and hand him over to your Mother, and then we can talk. _I_ shall listen at the door to hear what you say to him. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. 'Sure I don't care. _I'm_ not afraid of Captain Gadsby. </i></p><p><i>_In proof of this swings into drawing-room with a mannish stride followed by two short steps, which produces the effect of a restive horse entering. Misses CAPTAIN GADSBY, who is sitting in the shadow of the window-curtain, and gazes round helplessly._ </i></p><p><i>CAPTAIN GADSBY. (<i>Aside</i>) The filly, by Jove! 'Must ha' picked up that action from the sire. (<i>Aloud, rising</i>) Good evening, Miss Threegan. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Conscious that she is flushing</i>) Good evening, Captain Gadsby. Mamma told me to say that she will be ready in a few minutes. Won't you have some tea? (<i>Aside</i>) I hope Mamma will be quick. What _am_ I to say to the creature? (<i>Aloud and abruptly</i>) Milk and sugar? </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. No sugar, tha-anks, and very little milk. Ha-Hmmm. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Aside</i>) If he's going to do that, I'm lost. I shall laugh. I _know_ I shall! </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Pulling at his moustache and watching it sideways down his nose</i>) Ha-Hmmm. (<i>Aside</i>) 'Wonder what the little beast can talk about. 'Must make a shot at it. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Aside</i>) Oh, this is agonising. I _must_ say something. </i></p><p><i>BOTH TOGETHER. Have you been--- </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. I beg your pardon. You were going to say--- </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Who has been watching the moustache with awed fascination</i>) Won't you have some eggs? </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Looking bewilderedly at the tea-table</i>) Eggs! (<i>A side</i>) O Hades! She must have a nursery-tea at this hour. S'pose they've wiped her mouth and sent her to me while the Mother is getting on her duds. (<i>Aloud</i>) No, thanks. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Crimson with confusion</i>) Oh! I didn't mean that. I wasn't thinking of mou--eggs for an instant. I mean _salt_. Won't you have some sa--- sweets? (<i>Aside</i>) He'll think me a raving lunatic. I wish Mamma would come. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside</i>) It _was_ a nursery-tea and she's ashamed of it. By Jove! She doesn't look half bad when she colours up like that. (<i>Aloud, helping himself from the dish</i>) Have you seen those new chocolates at Peliti's? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. No, I made these myself. What are they like? </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. These! _De_-licious. (<i>Aside</i>) And that's a fact. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Aside</i>) Oh, bother! he'll think I'm fishing for compliments. (<i>Aloud</i>) No, Peliti's of course. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Enthusiastically</i>) Not to compare with these. How d'you make them? I can't get my _khansamah_ to understand the simplest thing beyond mutton and fowl. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Yes? I'm not a _khansamah_, you know. Perhaps you frighten him. You should never frighten a servant. He loses his head. It's very bad policy. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. He's so awf'ly stupid. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Folding her hands in her lap</i>) You should call him quietly and say: 'O _khansamah jee!_' </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Getting interested</i>) Yes? (<i>Aside</i>) Fancy that little featherweight saying, 'O _khansamah jee_' to my bloodthirsty Mir Khan! </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Then you should explain the dinner, dish by dish. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. But I can't speak the vernacular. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Patronizingly</i>) You should pass the Higher Standard and try. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. I have, but I don't seem to be any the wiser. Are you? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. I never passed the Higher Standard. But the _khansamah_ is very patient with me. He doesn't get angry when I talk about sheep's _topees_, or order _maunds_ of grain when I mean _seers_. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside, with intense indignation</i>) I'd like to see Mir Khan being rude to that girl! Hullo! Steady the Buffs! (<i>Aloud</i>) And do you understand about horses, too? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. A little--not very much. I can't doctor them, but I know what they ought to eat, and I am in charge of our stable. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. Indeed! You might help me then. What ought a man to give his _sais_ in the Hills? My ruffian says eight rupees, because everything is so dear. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Six rupees a month, and one rupee Simla allowance--neither more nor less. And a grass-cut gets six rupees. That's better than buying grass in the bazar. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Admiringly</i>) How do you know? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. I have tried both ways. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. Do you ride much, then? I've never seen you on the Mall. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Aside</i>) I haven't passed him _more_ than fifty times. (<i>Aloud</i>) Nearly every day. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. By Jove! I didn't know that. Ha-Hmmm! (<i>Pulls at his moustache and is silent for forty seconds</i>) </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Desperately, and wondering what will happen next.</i>) It looks beautiful. I shouldn't touch it if I were you. (<i>Aside</i>) It's all Mamma's fault for not coming before. I _will_ be rude! </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Bronzing under the tan and bringing down his hand very quickly</i>) Eh! Wha-at! Oh, yes! Ha! Ha! (<i>Laughs uneasily</i>) (<i>Aside</i>) Well, of _all_ the dashed cheek! I never had a woman say that to me yet. She must be a cool hand or else--Ah! that nursery-tea! </i></p><p><i>VOICE FROM THE UNKNOWN. Tchk! Tchk! Tchk! </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. Good Gracious! What's that? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. The dog, I think. (<i>Aside</i>) Emma _has_ been listening, and I'll never forgive her! </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside</i>) They don't keep dogs here. (<i>Aloud</i>) Didn't sound like a dog, did it? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Then it must have been the cat. Let's go into the veranda. What a lovely evening it is! </i></p><p><i>_Steps into veranda and looks out across the hills into sunset. The Captain follows._ </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside</i>) Superb eyes! I wonder that I never noticed them before! (<i>Aloud</i>) There's going to be a dance at Viceregal Lodge on Wednesday. Can you spare me one? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Shortly</i>) No! I don't want any of your charity-dances. You only ask me because Mamma told you to. I hop and I bump. You _know_ I do! </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside</i>) That's true, but little girls shouldn't understand these things. (<i>Aloud</i>) _No_, on my word, I don't. You dance beautifully. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Then why do you always stand out after half a dozen turns? I thought officers in the Army didn't tell fibs. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. It wasn't a fib, believe me. I really _do_ want the pleasure of a dance with you. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Wickedly</i>) Why? Won't Mamma dance with you any more? </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>More earnestly than the necessity demands</i>) I wasn't thinking of your Mother. (<i>Aside</i>) You little vixen! </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Still looking out of the window</i>) Eh? Oh, I beg your pardon. I was thinking of something else. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside</i>) Well! I wonder what she'll say next. I've never known a woman treat _me_ like this before. I might be--Dash it, I might be an Infantry subaltern! (<i>Aloud</i>) Oh, _please_ don't trouble. I'm not worth thinking about. Isn't your Mother ready yet? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. I should think so; but promise me, Captain Gadsby, you won't take poor dear Mamma twice round Jakko any more. It tires her so. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. She says that no exercise tires her. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Yes, but she suffers afterwards. _You_ don't know what rheumatism is, and you oughtn't to keep her out so late, when it gets chill in the evenings. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside</i>) Rheumatism! I _thought_ she came off her horse rather in a bunch. Whew! One lives and learns. (<i>Aloud</i>) I'm sorry to hear that. She hasn't mentioned it to me. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Flurried</i>) Of course not! Poor dear Mamma never would. And you mustn't say that I told you either. Promise me that you won't. Oh, Captain Gadsby, _promise_ me you won't! </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. I am dumb, or--I shall be as soon as you've given me that dance, and another--if you can trouble yourself to think about me for a minute. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. But you won't like it one little bit. You'll be awfully sorry afterwards. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. I shall like it above all things, and I shall only be sorry that I didn't get more. (<i>Aside</i>) Now what in the world am I saying? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Very well. You will have only yourself to thank if your toes are trodden on. Shall we say Seven? </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. And Eleven. (<i>Aside</i>) She can't be more than eight stone, but, even then, it's an absurdly small foot. (<i>Looks at his own riding boots</i>) </i></p><p><i>MISS T. They're beautifully shiny. I can almost see my face in them. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. I was thinking whether I should have to go on crutches for the rest of my life if you trod on my toes. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Very likely. Why not change Eleven for a square? </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. No, _please!_ I want them both waltzes. Won't you write them down? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. _I_ don't get so many dances that I shall confuse them. _You_ will be the offender. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. Wait and see! (<i>Aside</i>) She doesn't dance perfectly, perhaps, but-- </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Your tea must have got cold by this time. Won't you have another cup? </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. No, thanks. Don't you think it's pleasanter out in the veranda? (<i>Aside</i>) I never saw hair take that colour in the sunshine before. (<i>Aloud</i>) It's like one of Dicksee's pictures. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Yes! It's a wonderful sunset, isn't it? (<i>Bluntly</i>) But what do _you_ know about Dicksee's pictures? </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. I go Home occasionally. And I used to know the Galleries. (<i>Nervously</i>) You mustn't think me only a Philistine with--a moustache. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. Don't! _Please_ don't! I'm _so_ sorry for what I said then. I was _horribly_ rude. It slipped out before I thought. Don't you know the temptation to say frightful and shocking things just for the mere sake of saying them? I'm afraid I gave way to it. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Watching the girl as she flushes</i>) I _think_ I know the feeling. It would be terrible if we all yielded to it, wouldn't it? For instance, I might say-- </i></p><p><i>POOR DEAR MAMMA. (<i>Entering, habited, hatted, and booted</i>) Ah, Captain Gadsby! 'Sorry to keep you waiting. 'Hope you haven't been bored. 'My little girl been talking to you? </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Aside</i>) I'm not sorry I spoke about the rheumatism. I'm not! I'm NOT! I only wish I'd mentioned the corns too. </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside</i>) What a shame! I wonder how old she is. It never occurred to me before. (<i>Aloud</i>) We've been discussing 'Shakespeare and the musical glasses' in the veranda. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Aside.</i>) Nice man! He knows that quotation. He _isn't_ a Philistine with a moustache. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Good-bye, Captain Gadsby. (<i>Aside.</i>) What a huge hand and _what_ a squeeze! I don't suppose he meant it, but he has driven the rings into my fingers. </i></p><p><i>POOR DEAR MAMMA. Has Vermillion come round yet? Oh, yes! Captain Gadsby, don't you think that the saddle is too far forward? (<i>They pass into the front veranda.</i>) </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside.</i>) How the dickens should I know what she prefers? She told me that she doted on horses. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I think it is. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. (<i>Coming out into front veranda.</i>) Oh! Bad Buldoo! I must speak to him for this. He has taken up the curb two links, and Vermillion hates that. (<i>Passes out and to horse's head.</i>) </i></p><p><i>CAPT. G. Let me do it. </i></p><p><i>MISS T. No, Vermillion understands me. Don't you, old man? (<i>Looses curb-chain skilfully, and pats horse on nose and throttle.</i>) Poor Vermillion! _Did_ they want to cut his chin off? There! </i></p><p><i>CAPTAIN GADSBY _watches the interlude with undisguised admiration._ </i></p><p><i>POOR DEAR MAMMA. (<i>Tartly to_ MISS T.) You've forgotten your guest, I think, dear. </i></i></p><p><i><i>MISS T. Good gracious! So I have! Good-bye. (<i>Retreats indoors hastily</i>) </i></i></p><p><i><i>POOR DEAR MAMMA. (<i>Bunching reins in fingers hampered by too tight gauntlets</i>) Captain Gadsby! </i></i></p><p><i><i>CAPTAIN GADSBY _stoops and makes the foot-rest._ </i></i></p><p><i><i>POOR DEAR MAMMA _blunders, halts too long, and breaks through it._ </i></i></p><p><i><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside</i>) Can't hold up eleven stone for ever. It's all your rheumatism. (<i>Aloud</i>) Can't imagine why I was so clumsy. (<i>Aside</i>) Now Little Featherweight would have gone up like a bird. </i></i></p><p><i><i>_They ride out of the garden. The Captain falls back._ </i></i></p><p><i><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Aside</i>) How that habit catches her under the arms! Ugh! </i></i></p><p><i><i>POOR DEAR MAMMA. (<i>With the worn smile of sixteen seasons, the worse for exchange</i>) You're dull this afternoon, Captain Gadsby. </i></i></p><p><i><i>CAPT. G. (<i>Spurring up wearily</i>) Why did you keep me waiting so long? </i></i></p><p><i><i>_Et caetera, et caetera, et caetera._ </i></i></p><p><i><i>(AN INTERVAL OF THREE WEEKS.) </i></i></p><p><i><i>GILDED YOUTH.

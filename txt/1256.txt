<pre>I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand on the mark beside the shore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the first white pilgrim's bended knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where exile turned to ancestor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God was thanked for liberty.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have run through the night, my skin is as dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bend my knee down on this mark . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look on the sky and the sea.

II.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O pilgrim-souls, I speak to you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see you come out proud and slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the spirits pale as dew. . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And round me and round me ye go!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O pilgrims, I have gasped and run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night long from the whips of one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in your names works sin and woe.

III.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus I thought that I would come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kneel here where I knelt before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel your souls around me hum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In undertone to the ocean's roar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lift my black face, my black hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in your names, to curse this land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye blessed in freedom's evermore.

IV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am black, I am black;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet God made me, they say.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if He did so, smiling back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have cast His work away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the feet of His white creatures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a look of scorn, that the dusky features
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might be trodden again to clay.

V.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet He has made dark things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be glad and merry as light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a little dark bird sits and sings;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a dark stream ripples out of sight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dark frogs chant in the safe morass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sweetest stars are made to pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the face of the darkest night.

VI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we who are dark, we are dark!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, God, we have no stars!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About our souls in care and cark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our blackness shuts like prison bars:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor souls crouch so far behind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never a comfort can they find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By reaching through the prison-bars.

VII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we live beneath the sky, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That great smooth Hand of God, stretched out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all His children fatherly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bless them from the fear and doubt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which would be, if, from this low place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All opened straight up to His face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the grand eternity.

VIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still God's sunshine and His frost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They make us hot, they make us cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if we were not black and lost:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the beasts and birds, in wood and fold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do fear and take us for very men!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the weep-poor-will or the cat of the glen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look into my eyes and be bold?

IX.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am black, I am black!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, once, I laughed in girlish glee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one of my colour stood in the track
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the drivers drove, and looked at me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tender and full was the look he gave:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could a slave look so at another slave?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at the sky and the sea.

X.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from that hour our spirits grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As free as if unsold, unbought:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, strong enough, since we were two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conquer the world, we thought!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drivers drove us day by day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not mind, we went one way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no better a liberty sought.

XI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sunny ground between the canes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said "I love you" as he passed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shingle-roof rang sharp with the rains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard how he vowed it fast:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While others shook, he smiled in the hut
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he carved me a bowl of the cocoa-nut,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the roar of the hurricanes.

XII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sang his name instead of a song;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over I sang his name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upward and downward I drew it along
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My various notes; the same, the same!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sang it low, that the slave-girls near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might never guess from aught they could hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only a name.

XIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look on the sky and the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were two to love, and two to pray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, two, O God, who cried to Thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though nothing didst Thou say.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coldly Thou sat'st behind the sun!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I cry who am but one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How wilt Thou speak to-day?

XIV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were black, we were black!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had no claim to love and bliss:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What marvel, if each turned to lack?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wrung my cold hands out of his,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dragged him . . . where? . . . I crawled to touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blood's mark in the dust! . . . not much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye pilgrim-souls, . . . though plain as this!

XV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrong, followed by a deeper wrong!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere grief's too good for such as I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the white men brought the shame ere long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strangle the sob of my agony.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would not leave me for my dull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet eyes! it was too merciful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let me weep pure tears and die.

XVI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am black, I am black!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wore a child upon my breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amulet that hung too slack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in my unrest, could not rest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we went moaning, child and mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One to another, one to another,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until all ended for the best:

XVII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hark! I will tell you low . . . Iow . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am black, you see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the babe who lay on my bosom so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was far too white . . . too white for me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As white as the ladies who scorned to pray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside me at church but yesterday;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though my tears had washed a place for my knee.

XVIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own, own child! I could not bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look in his face, it was so white.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I covered him up with a kerchief there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I covered his face in close and tight:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he moaned and struggled, as well might be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the white child wanted his liberty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha, ha! he wanted his master right.

XIX.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moaned and beat with his head and feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His little feet that never grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struck them out, as it was meet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against my heart to break it through.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might have sung and made him mild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I dared not sing to the white-faced child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only song I knew.

XX.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled the kerchief very close:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not see the sun, I swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More, then, alive, than now he does
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From between the roots of the mango . . . where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . I know where. Close! a child and mother
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do wrong to look at one another,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one is black and one is fair.

XXI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, in that single glance I had
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my child's face, . . . I tell you all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a look that made me mad . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master's look, that used to fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my soul like his lash . . . or worse!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, to save it from my curse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I twisted it round in my shawl.

XXII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he moaned and trembled from foot to head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shivered from head to foot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, after a time, he lay instead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too suddenly still and mute.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt, beside, a stiffening cold, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dared to lift up just a fold . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in lifting a leaf of the mango-fruit.

XXIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my fruit . . . ha, ha! there, had been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I laugh to think on't at this hour! . . .)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your fine white angels, who have seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearest the secret of God's power, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plucked my fruit to make them wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sucked the soul of that child of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the humming-bird sucks the soul of the flower.

XXIV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha, ha, for the trick of the angels white!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They freed the white child's spirit so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said not a word, but, day and night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I carried the body to and fro;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it lay on my heart like a stone . . . as chill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun may shine out as much as he will:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am cold, though it happened a month ago.

XXV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the white man's house, and the black man's hut,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I carried the little body on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest's arms did round us shut,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silence through the trees did run:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They asked no question as I went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood too high for astonishment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could see God sit on His throne.

XXVI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little body, kerchiefed fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bore it on through the forest . . . on:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I felt it was tired at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I scooped a hole beneath the moon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest-tops the angels far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a white sharp finger from every star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did point and mock at what was done.

XXVII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet when it was all done aright, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth, 'twixt me and my baby, strewed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All, changed to black earth, . . . nothing white, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark child in the dark, ensued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some comfort, and my heart grew young:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sate down smiling there and sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song I learnt in my maidenhood.

XXVIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus we two were reconciled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white child and black mother, thus:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, as I sang it, soft and wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same song, more melodious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose from the grave whereon I sate!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the dead child singing that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To join the souls of both of us.

XXIX.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look on the sea and the sky!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the pilgrims' ships first anchored lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free sun rideth gloriously;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pilgrim-ghosts have slid away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the earliest streaks of the morn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My face is black, but it glares with a scorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which they dare not meet by day.

XXX.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! in their 'stead, their hunter sons!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ah! they are on me they hunt in a ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep off! I brave you all at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I throw off your eyes like snakes that sting!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have killed the black eagle at nest, I think:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you never stand still in your triumph, and shrink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the stroke of her wounded wing?

XXXI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Man, drop that stone you dared to lift!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you, who stand there five a-breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each, for his own wife's joy and gift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little corpse as safely at rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mine in the mangos! Yes, but she
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May keep live babies on her knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing the song she liketh best.

XXXll.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not mad: I am black.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see you staring in my face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you, staring, shrinking back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye are born of the Washington-race:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this land is the free America:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this mark on my wrist . . . (I prove what I say)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ropes tied me up here to the flogging-place.

XXXIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think I shrieked then? Not a sound!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hung, as a gourd hangs in the sun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only cursed them all around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As softly as I might have done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My very own child! From these sands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the mountains, lift your hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O slaves, and end what I begun!

XXXIV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whips, curses; these must answer those!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For in this union, you have set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two kinds of men in adverse rows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each loathing each: and all forget
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven wounds in Christ's body fair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While HE sees gaping everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our countless wounds that pay no debt.

XXXV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our wounds are different. Your white men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are, after all, not gods indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor able to make Christs again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do good with bleeding. We who bleed . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Stand off!) we help not in our loss!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are too heavy for our cross,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fall and crush you and your seed.

XXXVI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fall, I swoon! I look at the sky:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds are breaking on my brain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am floated along, as if I should die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of liberty's exquisite pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of the white child, waiting for me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the death-dark where we may kiss and agree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White men, I leave you all curse-free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my broken heart's disdain!

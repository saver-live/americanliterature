<p>An A.D.T. Kid carrying a Death Message marked "Rush" stopped in front of a Show Window containing a Picture of James J. Jeffries and began to weep bitterly.</p><p><img alt="George Ade, The Fable of the Kid Who Shifted His Ideal" title="George Ade, The Fable of the Kid Who Shifted His Ideal" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/the-fable-of-the-kid-who-shifted-his-ideal.jpg" style="max-width:300px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1584877838" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> A kind-hearted Suburbanite happened to be passing along on his Way to the 5:42 Train. He was carrying a Dog Collar, a Sickle, a Basket of Egg Plums and a Bicycle Tire.</p><p>The Suburbanite saw the A.D.T.

For Six Years I have been a Member of the League of American Wheelmen and now I am a Candidate for Director of our new four-hole Golf Club. Also I play Whist on the Train with a Man who once lived in the same House with T. DeWitt Talmage."</p><p>Hearing these words the A.D.T. Kid ceased weeping and cheerfully proceeded up an Alley, where he played "Wood Tag."</p><p>Moral: As the Twig is Bent the Tree is Inclined.</p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

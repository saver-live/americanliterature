<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the long and dreary Winter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the cold and cruel Winter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever thicker, thicker, thicker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froze the ice on lake and river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever deeper, deeper, deeper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the snow o'er all the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the covering snow, and drifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest, round the village.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly from his buried wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the hunter force a passage;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens and his snow-shoes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly walked he through the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought for bird or beast and found none,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw no track of deer or rabbit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snow beheld no footprints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ghastly, gleaming forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell, and could not rise from weakness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perished there from cold and hunger.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the famine and the fever!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the wasting of the famine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the blasting of the fever!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the wailing of the children!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the anguish of the women!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the earth was sick and famished;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry was the air around them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry was the sky above them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hungry stars in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eyes of wolves glared at them!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into Hiawatha's wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came two other guests, as silent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ghosts were, and as gloomy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited not to be invited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not parley at the doorway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat there without word of welcome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the seat of Laughing Water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked with haggard eyes and hollow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the face of Laughing Water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the foremost said: "Behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Famine, Bukadawin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other said: "Behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Fever, Ahkosewin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lovely Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuddered as they looked upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuddered at the words they uttered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down on her bed in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid her face, but made no answer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay there trembling, freezing, burning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the looks they cast upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fearful words they uttered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into the empty forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed the maddened Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart was deadly sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his face a stony firmness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his brow the sweat of anguish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started, but it froze and fell not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in furs and armed for hunting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mighty bow of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his quiver full of arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the vast and vacant forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his snow-shoes strode he forward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gitche Manito, the Mighty!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried he with his face uplifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that bitter hour of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give your children food, O father!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give us food, or we must perish!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me food for Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my dying Minnehaha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the far-resounding forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest vast and vacant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang that cry of desolation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there came no other answer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the echo of his crying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the echo of the woodlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Minnehaha! Minnehaha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long roved Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that melancholy forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the shadow of whose thickets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant days of Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that ne'er forgotten Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had brought his young wife homeward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Dacotahs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the birds sang in the thickets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the streamlets laughed and glistened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the air was full of fragrance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lovely Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said with voice that did not tremble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will follow you, my husband!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wigwam with Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those gloomy guests that watched her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Famine and the Fever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was lying, the Beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, the dying Minnehaha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hark!" she said; "I hear a rushing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear a roaring and a rushing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the Falls of Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling to me from a distance!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, my child!" said old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the night-wind in the pine-trees!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look!" she said; "I see my father
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing lonely at his doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckoning to me from his wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, my child!" said old Nokomis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the smoke, that waves and beckons!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" said she, "the eyes of Pauguk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glare upon me in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can feel his icy fingers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasping mine amid the darkness!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha! Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the desolate Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far away amid the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miles away among the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard that sudden cry of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the voice of Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling to him in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hiawatha! Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over snow-fields waste and pathless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under snow-encumbered branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward hurried Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Nokomis moaning, wailing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wahonowin! Wahonowin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that I had perished for you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that I were dead as you are!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahonowin! Wahonowin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he rushed into the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the old Nokomis slowly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocking to and fro and moaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw his lovely Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying dead and cold before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his bursting heart within him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttered such a cry of anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the forest moaned and shuddered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the very stars in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook and trembled with his anguish.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he sat down, still and speechless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bed of Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feet of Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At those willing feet, that never
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More would lightly run to meet him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never more would lightly follow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands his face he covered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven long days and nights he sat there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if in a swoon he sat there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless, motionless, unconscious
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the daylight or the darkness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they buried Minnehaha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snow a grave they made her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest deep and darksome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the moaning hemlocks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothed her in her richest garments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped her in her robes of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered her with snow, like ermine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they buried Minnehaha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at night a fire was lighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her grave four times was kindled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her soul upon its journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Islands of the Blessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his doorway Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw it burning in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his sleepless bed uprising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bed of Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood and watched it at the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it might not be extinguished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might not leave her in the darkness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" said he, "Minnehaha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, O my Laughing Water!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my heart is buried with you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my thoughts go onward with you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come not back again to labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come not back again to suffer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Famine and the Fever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear the heart and waste the body.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon my task will be completed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon your footsteps I shall follow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Islands of the Blessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Land of the Hereafter!"

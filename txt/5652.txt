<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead he lay among his books!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace of God was in his looks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the statues in the gloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch o'er Maximilian's tomb,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So those volumes from their shelves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched him, silent as themselves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! his hand will nevermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn their storied pages o'er;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevermore his lips repeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of theirs, however sweet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the lifeless body rest!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is gone, who was its guest;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone, as travellers haste to leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inn, nor tarry until eve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traveller! in what realms afar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what planet, in what star,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what vast, aerial space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines the light upon thy face?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what gardens of delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest thy weary feet to-night?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poet! thou, whose latest verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a garland on thy hearse;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast sung, with organ tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Deukalion's life, thine own;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ruins of the Past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blooms the perfect flower at last.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend! but yesterday the bells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang for thee their loud farewells;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to-day they toll for thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying dead beyond the sea;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying dead among thy books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace of God in all thy looks!

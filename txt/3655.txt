<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice a week the winter thorough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here stood I to keep the goal:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Football then was fighting sorrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the young man's soul.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in May time to the wicket
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out I march with bat and pad:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the son of grief at cricket
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to be glad.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try I will; no harm in trying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonder 'tis how little mirth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps the bones of man from lying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bed of earth.

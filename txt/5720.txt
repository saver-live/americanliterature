<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead, the beautiful youth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of honor, the tongue of truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, the life and light of us all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose voice was blithe as a bugle-call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom all eyes followed with one consent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheer of whose laugh, and whose pleasant word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hushed all murmurs of discontent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only last night, as we rode along,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the dark of the mountain gap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To visit the picket-guard at the ford,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little dreaming of any mishap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was humming the words of some old song:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two red roses he had on his cap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another he bore at the point of his sword."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden and swift a whistling ball
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came out of a wood, and the voice was still;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something I heard in the darkness fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for a moment my blood grew chill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spake in a whisper, as he who speaks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a room where some one is lying dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he made no answer to what I said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lifted him up to his saddle again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the mire and the mist and the rain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carried him back to the silent camp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid him as if asleep on his bed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I saw by the light of the surgeon's lamp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two white roses upon his cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one, just over his heart, blood-red!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I saw in a vision how far and fleet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fatal bullet went speeding forth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it reached a town in the distant North,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it reached a house in a sunny street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it reached a heart that ceased to beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a murmur, without a cry;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a bell was tolled, in that far-off town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one who had passed from cross to crown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the neighbors wondered that she should die.

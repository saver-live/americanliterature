<p>Amongst the grandeur of Hua Shan<br> I climb to the Flower Peak,<br> and fancy I see fairies and immortals<br> carrying lotus in their<br> sacred white hands, robes flowing<br> they fly filling the sky with colour<br> as they rise to the palace of heaven,<br> inviting me to go to the cloud stage<br> and see Wei Shu-ching, guardian angel<br> of Hua Shan; so dreamily I go with them<br> riding to the sky on the back<br> of wild geese which call as they fly,<br> but when we look below at Loyang,<br> not so clear because of the mist,<br> everywhere could be seen looting<br> armies, which took Loyang, creating<br> chaos and madness with blood<br> flowing everywhere; like animals of prey<br> rebel army men made into officials<br> with caps and robes to match. <br></p>

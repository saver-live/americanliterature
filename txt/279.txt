<p>We shall not sip from the same glass,<br> No water for us, or sweet wine;<br> We'll not embrace at morning,<br> Not gaze from the same sill at night;<br> You breathe the sun, I the moon,<br> Yet the one love keeps us alive.<br> <br> Always with me, tender, true friend,<br> And your smiling friend's with you.<br> But I know the pain in your grey eyes,<br> And my sickness is down to you, too.<br> In short, we mustn't meet often,<br> To be certain of peace of mind.<br> <br> Yet it's your voice sings in my poems,<br> And in your poems my breath sighs,<br> O, beyond the reach of distance or fear,<br> There is a fireâ€¦<br> And if you knew how dear to me<br> Are those dry, pale lips of yours now.<br></p>

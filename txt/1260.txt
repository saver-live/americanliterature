<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seraph sings before the manifest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God-One, and in the burning of the Seven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the full life of consummate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaving beneath him like a mother's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm with her first-born's slumber in that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet sings upon the earth grave-riven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the naughty world, soon self-forgiven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wronging him, and in the darkness prest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his own soul by worldly weights.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, Sing, seraph with the glory! heaven is high;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing, poet with the sorrow! earth is low:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universe's inward voices cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Amen' to either song of joy and woe:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing, seraph, poet, sing on equally!

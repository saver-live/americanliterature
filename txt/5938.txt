<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his lodge beside a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close beside a frozen river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat an old man, sad and lonely.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White his hair was as a snow-drift;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dull and low his fire was burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old man shook and trembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folded in his Waubewyon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his tattered white-skin-wrapper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing nothing but the tempest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it roared along the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing nothing but the snow-storm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it whirled and hissed and drifted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the coals were white with ashes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fire was slowly dying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young man, walking lightly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the open doorway entered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red with blood of youth his cheeks were,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft his eyes, as stars in Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound his forehead was with grasses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound and plumed with scented grasses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his lips a smile of beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the lodge with sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his hand a bunch of blossoms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the lodge with sweetness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, my son!" exclaimed the old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy are my eyes to see you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit here on the mat beside me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit here by the dying embers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pass the night together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me of your strange adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lands where you have travelled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell you of my prowess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my many deeds of wonder."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his pouch he drew his peace-pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very old and strangely fashioned;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of red stone was the pipe-head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stem a reed with feathers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the pipe with bark of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placed a burning coal upon it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave it to his guest, the stranger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And began to speak in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I blow my breath about me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I breathe upon the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless are all the rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard as stone becomes the water!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the young man answered, smiling:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I blow my breath about me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I breathe upon the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers spring up o'er all the meadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing, onward rush the rivers!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I shake my hoary tresses,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the old man darkly frowning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the land with snow is covered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the leaves from all the branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall and fade and die and wither,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I breathe, and lo! they are not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the waters and the marshes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise the wild goose and the heron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly away to distant regions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I speak, and lo! they are not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where'er my footsteps wander,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wild beasts of the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide themselves in holes and caverns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the earth becomes as flintstone!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I shake my flowing ringlets,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the young man, softly laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Showers of rain fall warm and welcome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plants lift up their heads rejoicing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back into their lakes and marshes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come the wild goose and the heron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward shoots the arrowy swallow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing the bluebird and the robin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where'er my footsteps wander,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the meadows wave with blossoms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the woodlands ring with music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the trees are dark with foliage!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they spake, the night departed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the distant realms of Wabun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his shining lodge of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a warrior robed and painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the sun, and said, "Behold me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gheezis, the great sun, behold me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the old man's tongue was speechless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the air grew warm and pleasant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon the wigwam sweetly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the bluebird and the robin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stream began to murmur,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a scent of growing grasses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the lodge was gently wafted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Segwun, the youthful stranger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More distinctly in the daylight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the icy face before him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Peboan, the Winter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his eyes the tears were flowing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from melting lakes the streamlets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his body shrunk and dwindled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the shouting sun ascended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till into the air it faded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till into the ground it vanished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the young man saw before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hearth-stone of the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the fire had smoked and smouldered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the earliest flower of Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the Beauty of the Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the Miskodeed in blossom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was that in the North-land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that unheard-of coldness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That intolerable Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Spring with all its splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its birds and all its blossoms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its flowers and leaves and grasses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing on the wind to northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying in great flocks, like arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like huge arrows shot through heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed the swan, the Mahnahbezee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking almost as a man speaks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in long lines waving, bending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a bow-string snapped asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the white goose, Waw-be-wawa;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in pairs, or singly flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahng the loon, with clangorous pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grouse, the Mushkodasa.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thickets and the meadows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piped the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the summit of the lodges
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the covert of the pine-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooed the pigeon, the Omemee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sorrowing Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless in his infinite sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard their voices calling to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went forth from his gloomy doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood and gazed into the heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed upon the earth and waters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his wanderings far to eastward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the regions of the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shining land of Wabun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward now returned Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great traveller, the great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of new and strange adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvels many and many wonders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people of the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened to him as he told them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his marvellous adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing answered him in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh! it is indeed Iagoo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one else beholds such wonders!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had seen, he said, a water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bigger than the Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broader than the Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitter so that none could drink it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each other looked the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked the women at each other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled, and said, "It cannot be so!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaw!" they said, it cannot be so!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er it, said he, o'er this water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came a great canoe with pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A canoe with wings came flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bigger than a grove of pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taller than the tallest tree-tops!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old men and the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked and tittered at each other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaw!" they said, "we don't believe it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its mouth, he said, to greet him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came Waywassimo, the lightning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the thunder, Annemeekee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the warriors and the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed aloud at poor Iagoo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaw!" they said, "what tales you tell us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In it, said he, came a people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great canoe with pinions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came, he said, a hundred warriors;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted white were all their faces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with hair their chins were covered!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the warriors and the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed and shouted in derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the ravens on the tree-tops,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the crows upon the hemlocks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaw!" they said, "what lies you tell us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think that we believe them!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Hiawatha laughed not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he gravely spake and answered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their jeering and their jesting:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True is all Iagoo tells us;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen it in a vision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen the great canoe with pinions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen the people with white faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen the coming of this bearded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People of the wooden vessel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the regions of the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shining land of Wabun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gitche Manito, the Mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Spirit, the Creator,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends them hither on his errand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends them to us with his message.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheresoe'er they move, before them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swarms the stinging fly, the Ahmo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swarms the bee, the honey-maker;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheresoe'er they tread, beneath them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs a flower unknown among us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs the White-man's Foot in blossom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us welcome, then, the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail them as our friends and brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heart's right hand of friendship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give them when they come to see us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the Mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said this to me in my vision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I beheld, too, in that vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the secrets of the future,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the distant days that shall be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beheld the westward marches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the unknown, crowded nations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the land was full of people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restless, struggling, toiling, striving,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking many tongues, yet feeling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one heart-beat in their bosoms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woodlands rang their axes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoked their towns in all the valleys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over all the lakes and rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed their great canoes of thunder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then a darker, drearier vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed before me, vague and cloud-like;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beheld our nation scattered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All forgetful of my counsels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weakened, warring with each other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the remnants of our people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping westward, wild and woful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the cloud-rack of a tempest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the withered leaves of Autumn!"

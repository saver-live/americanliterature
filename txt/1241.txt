&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED TO E. J.</b>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience, like a pale musician, holds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dulcimer of patience in his hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence harmonies, we cannot understand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of God; will in his worlds, the strain unfolds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sad-perplexed minors: deathly colds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall on us while we hear, and countermand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sanguine heart back from the fancyland
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With nightingales in visionary worlds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We murmur' Where is any certain tune
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or measured music in such notes as these?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But angels, leaning from the golden seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not so minded their fine ear hath won
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of completed cadences,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, smiling down the stars, they whisper sweet.

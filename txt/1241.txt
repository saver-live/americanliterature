<p>He was, and is not! Graecia's trembling shore,<br> Sighing through all her palmy groves, shall tell<br> That Harold's pilgrimage at last is o'er—<br> Mute the impassioned tongue, and tuneful shell,<br> That erst was wont in noblest strains to swell—<br> Hush'd the proud shouts that rode Aegaea's wave!<br> For lo! the great Deliv'rer breathes farewell!<br> Gives to the world his mem'ry and a grave—<br> Expiring in the land he only lived to save!<br> <br> Mourn, Hellas, mourn! and o'er thy widow'd brow,<br> For aye, the cypress wreath of sorrow twine;<br> And in thy new-form'd beauty, desolate, throw<br> The fresh-cull'd flowers on his sepulchral shrine.<br> Yes! let that heart whose fervour was all thine,<br> In consecrated urn lamented be!<br> That generous heart where genius thrill'd divine,<br> Hath spent its last most glorious throb for thee—<br> Then sank amid the storm that made thy children free!<br> <br> Britannia's Poet! Graecia's hero, sleeps!<br> And Freedom, bending o'er the breathless clay,<br> Lifts up her voice, and in her anguish weeps!<br> For us, a night hath clouded o'er our day,<br> And hush'd the lips that breath'd our fairest lay.<br> Alas! and must the British lyre resound<br> A requiem, while the spirit wings away<br> Of him who on its strings such music found,<br> And taught its startling chords to give so sweet a sound!<br> <br> The theme grows sadder — but my soul shall find<br> A language in those tears! No more — no more!<br> Soon, 'midst the shriekings of the tossing wind,<br> The "dark blue depths" he sang of, shall have bore<br> Our all of Byron to his native shore!<br> His grave is thick with voices — to the ear<br> Murm'ring an awful tale of greatness o'er;<br> But Memory strives with Death, and lingering near,<br> Shall consecrate the dust of Harold's lonely bier!</p>

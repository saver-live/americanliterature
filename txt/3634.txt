<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, in the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the happy field of hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh they looked at one another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the light of day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blue and silver morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the haycock as they lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh they looked at one another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they looked away.

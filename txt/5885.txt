<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the handsome Yenadizze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced at Hiawatha's wedding;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the gentle Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of musicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his songs of love and longing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Iagoo, the great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the marvellous story-teller,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told his tales of strange adventure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feast might be more joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the time might pass more gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the guests be more contented.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sumptuous was the feast Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made at Hiawatha's wedding;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the bowls were made of bass-wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White and polished very smoothly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the spoons of horn of bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black and polished very smoothly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had sent through all the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messengers with wands of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sign of invitation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a token of the feasting;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wedding guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad in all their richest raiment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robes of fur and belts of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splendid with their paint and plumage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful with beads and tassels.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First they ate the sturgeon, Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pike, the Maskenozha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught and cooked by old Nokomis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on pemican they feasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pemican and buffalo marrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunch of deer and hump of bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow cakes of the Mondamin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wild rice of the river.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gracious Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lovely Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the careful old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasted not the food before them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only waited on the others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only served their guests in silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when all the guests had finished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Nokomis, brisk and busy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an ample pouch of otter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the red-stone pipes for smoking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tobacco from the South-land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixed with bark of the red willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with herbs and leaves of fragrance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she said, "O Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance for us your merry dances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance the Beggar's Dance to please us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feast may be more joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the time may pass more gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our guests be more contented!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the idle Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the merry mischief-maker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom the people called the Storm-Fool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose among the guests assembled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skilled was he in sports and pastimes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the merry dance of snow-shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the play of quoits and ball-play;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skilled was he in games of hazard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all games of skill and hazard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pugasaing, the Bowl and Counters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuntassoo, the Game of Plum-stones.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the warriors called him Faint-Heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called him coward, Shaugodaya,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idler, gambler, Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little heeded he their jesting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little cared he for their insults,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the women and the maidens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dressed in shirt of doeskin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White and soft, and fringed with ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All inwrought with beads of wampum;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dressed in deer-skin leggings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in moccasins of buck-skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick with quills and beads embroidered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his head were plumes of swan's down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his heels were tails of foxes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one hand a fan of feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a pipe was in the other.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barred with streaks of red and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaks of blue and bright vermilion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone the face of Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his forehead fell his tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth, and parted like a woman's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining bright with oil, and plaited,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung with braids of scented grasses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As among the guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sound of flutes and singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sound of drums and voices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And began his mystic dances.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First he danced a solemn measure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very slow in step and gesture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out among the pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the shadows and the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treading softly like a panther.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then more swiftly and still swifter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirling, spinning round in circles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaping o'er the guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddying round and round the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the leaves went whirling with him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the dust and wind together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept in eddies round about him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then along the sandy margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lake, the Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On he sped with frenzied gestures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamped upon the sand, and tossed it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildly in the air around him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the wind became a whirlwind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sand was blown and sifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like great snowdrifts o'er the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaping all the shores with Sand Dunes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand Hills of the Nagow Wudjoo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the merry Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced his Beggar's Dance to please them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, returning, sat down laughing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There among the guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat and fanned himself serenely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fan of turkey-feathers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they said to Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the friend of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sweetest of all singers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the best of all musicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sing to us, O Chibiabos!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of love and songs of longing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feast may be more joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the time may pass more gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our guests be more contented!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gentle Chibiabos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang in accents sweet and tender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang in tones of deep emotion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of love and songs of longing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking still at Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at fair Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang he softly, sang in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Onaway!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake, beloved!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou the wild-flower of the forest!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou the wild-bird of the prairie!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou with eyes so soft and fawn-like!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If thou only lookest at me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy, I am happy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the lilies of the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they feel the dew upon them!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet thy breath is as the fragrance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wild-flowers in the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their fragrance is at evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Moon when leaves are falling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does not all the blood within me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leap to meet thee, leap to meet thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the springs to meet the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Moon when nights are brightest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Onaway! my heart sings to thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sings with joy when thou art near me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sighing, singing branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant Moon of Strawberries!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When thou art not pleased, beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my heart is sad and darkened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the shining river darkens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the clouds drop shadows on it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When thou smilest, my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my troubled heart is brightened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in sunshine gleam the ripples
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the cold wind makes in rivers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smiles the earth, and smile the waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile the cloudless skies above us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I lose the way of smiling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou art no longer near me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I myself, myself! behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood of my beating heart, behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh awake, awake, beloved!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onaway! awake, beloved!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the gentle Chibiabos
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his song of love and longing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iagoo, the great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the marvellous story-teller,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the friend of old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous of the sweet musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous of the applause they gave him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw in all the eyes around him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw in all their looks and gestures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the wedding guests assembled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longed to hear his pleasant stories,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His immeasurable falsehoods.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very boastful was Iagoo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never heard he an adventure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But himself had met a greater;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never any deed of daring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But himself had done a bolder;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never any marvellous story
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But himself could tell a stranger.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you listen to his boasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you only give him credence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one ever shot an arrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half so far and high as he had;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever caught so many fishes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever killed so many reindeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever trapped so many beaver!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None could run so fast as he could,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None could dive so deep as he could,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None could swim so far as he could;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None had made so many journeys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None had seen so many wonders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this wonderful Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this marvellous story-teller!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus his name became a by-word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a jest among the people;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whene'er a boastful hunter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praised his own address too highly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a warrior, home returning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talked too much of his achievements,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his hearers cried, "Iagoo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's Iagoo come among us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who carved the cradle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the little Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carved its framework out of linden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound it strong with reindeer sinews;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who taught him later
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to make his bows and arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to make the bows of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the arrows of the oak-tree.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So among the guests assembled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my Hiawatha's wedding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat Iagoo, old and ugly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the marvellous story-teller.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they said, "O good Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us now a tale of wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us of some strange adventure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the feast may be more joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the time may pass more gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our guests be more contented!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iagoo answered straightway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shall hear a tale of wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear the strange adventures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Osseo, the Magician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Evening Star descending."

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Doll in the doll-makers house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks at the cradle and balls:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an insult to us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the oldest of all the dolls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had seen, being kept for show,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generations of his sort,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-screams the whole shelf: Although
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theres not a man can report
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil of this place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man and the woman bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither to our disgrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noisy and filthy thing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing him groan and stretch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doll-makers wife is aware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband has heard the wretch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crouched by the arm of his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She murmurs into his ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head upon shoulder leant:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear, my dear, oh dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an accident.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought ay like a flower upon mine heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drew around it other thoughts like bees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For multitude and thirst of sweetnesses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat rejoicing, I desired the art
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Greek whistler, who to wharf and mart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could lure those insect swarms from orange-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I might hive with me such thoughts and please
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul so, always. foolish counterpart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a weak man's vain wishes! While I spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought I called a flower grew nettle-rough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts, called bees, stung me to festering:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, entertain (cried Reason as she woke)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your best and gladdest thoughts but long enough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they will all prove sad enough to sting!

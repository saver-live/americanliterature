<p><cite class="al-title">Foods That Will Win the War and How to Cook Them</cite> is an interesting historic account of how precious food was during the First World War, and what an act of patriotism it was to go without or save food for the benefit of our troops overseas. "What are you giving so that others may live?" "Send more to Europe or they will Starve." The book's recipes were based on guidelines issued by the United States Food Administration to substitute non-wheat grains to consume less wheat, meat, fats, and sugar.</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Foods That Will Win the War/Little Americans" title="Foods That Will Win the War, Little Americans" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/houston-and-alberta-goudiss.jpg" style="max-width:300px; float:left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="4121561836" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> Published as a guide to housekeepers in 1918 by food expert and publisher of Forecast Magazine, C. Houston Goudiss, and his wife, Alberta M. Goudiss, the Director of The School of Modern Cookery. "Two meatless days a week would mean a saving of 2,200,000 lbs. of meat per annum." It's hard to fathom in this day-and-age in the western world, where global imports make a huge variety of food available year-round for most of us. The book is a fascinating historical link how food was valued during war time.</p><p>Featured in our collection of <a href="/world-war-one-literature">World War I Literature</a> and <a href="/foodie-stories#foodie-books">Foodie Books &amp; Wartime Recipes</a></p><p><img alt="Foods That Will Win the War/, Save Wheats" title="Foods That Will Win the War/God Gives Us" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/save-wheat.jpg" style="max-width:350px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="2000978858" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"></p><p><a href="forward">Forward</a></p><p><a href="save-wheat">Save Wheat</a></p><p><a href="the-use-of-corn">The Use of Corn</a></p><p><a href="the-use-of-oats">The Use of Oats</a></p><p><a href="the-use-of-rye">The Use of Rye</a></p><p><a href="the-use-of-barley">The Use of Barley</a></p><p><a href="the-use-of-potato">The Use of Potato</a></p><p><a href="the-use-of-mixed-grains">The Use of Mixed Grains</a></p><p><a href="pancakes-and-waffles">Pancakes and Waffles</a></p><p><a href="more-recipes-coming-soon">More Recipes Coming Soon!</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/c-houston-alberta-goudiss">C.

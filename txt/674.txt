<p>Blue mountains lie beyond the north wall;<br> Round the city's eastern side flows the white water.<br> Here we part, friend, once forever.<br> You go ten thousand miles, drifting away<br> Like an unrooted water-grass.<br> Oh, the floating clouds and the thoughts of a wanderer!<br> Oh, the sunset and the longing of an old friend!<br> We ride away from each other, waving our hands,<br> While our horses neigh softly, softly . . . . <br></p>

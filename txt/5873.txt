<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward through the evening twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days that are forgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unremembered ages,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the full moon fell Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the beautiful Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She a wife, but not a mother.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was sporting with her women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swinging in a swing of grape-vines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When her rival, the rejected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of jealousy and hatred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut the leafy swing asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut in twain the twisted grape-vines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nokomis fell affrighted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward through the evening twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Muskoday, the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the prairie full of blossoms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See! a star falls!" said the people;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the sky a star is falling!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There among the ferns and mosses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There among the prairie lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Muskoday, the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moonlight and the starlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Nokomis bore a daughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she called her name Wenonah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first-born of her daughters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the daughter of Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew up like the prairie lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew a tall and slender maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beauty of the moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beauty of the starlight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nokomis warned her often,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying oft, and oft repeating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, beware of Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the West-Wind, Mudjekeewis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen not to what he tells you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie not down upon the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoop not down among the lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the West-Wind come and harm you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she heeded not the warning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heeded not those words of wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the West-Wind came at evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking lightly o'er the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispering to the leaves and blossoms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending low the flowers and grasses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the beautiful Wenonah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying there among the lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wooed her with his words of sweetness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wooed her with his soft caresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till she bore a son in sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore a son of love and sorrow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was born my Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was born the child of wonder;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the daughter of Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha's gentle mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her anguish died deserted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the West-Wind, false and faithless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the heartless Mudjekeewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her daughter long and loudly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wailed and wept the sad Nokomis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh that I were dead!" she murmured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh that I were dead, as thou art!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more work, and no more weeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahonowin!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahonowin!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shores of Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shining Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark behind it rose the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the firs with cones upon them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright before it beat the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat the clear and sunny water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the wrinkled old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nursed the little Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocked him in his linden cradle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedded soft in moss and rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safely bound with reindeer sinews;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stilled his fretful wail by saying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lulled him into slumber, singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ewa-yea! my little owlet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is this, that lights the wigwam?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his great eyes lights the wigwam?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ewa-yea! my little owlet!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things Nokomis taught him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the stars that shine in heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flaring far away to northward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the frosty nights of Winter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed the broad white road in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running straight across the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door on summer evenings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the little Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the lapping of the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds of music, words of wonder;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Minne-wawa!" said the Pine-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mudway-aushka!" said the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitting through the dusk of evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the twinkle of its candle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting up the brakes and bushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he sang the song of children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the song Nokomis taught him:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little, flitting, white-fire insect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little, dancing, white-fire creature,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light me with your little candle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere upon my bed I lay me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the moon rise from the water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rippling, rounding from the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the flecks and shadows on it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good Nokomis answered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once a warrior, very angry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized his grandmother, and threw her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up into the sky at midnight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right against the moon he threw her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is her body that you see there."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the rainbow in the heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eastern sky, the rainbow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good Nokomis answered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the heaven of flowers you see there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wild-flowers of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the lilies of the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on earth they fade and perish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossom in that heaven above us."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the owls at midnight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hooting, laughing in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" he cried in terror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that," he said, "Nokomis?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good Nokomis answered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is but the owl and owlet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking in their native language,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking, scolding at each other."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the little Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned of every bird its language,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned their names and all their secrets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they built their nests in Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they hid themselves in Winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talked with them whene'er he met them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called them "Hiawatha's Chickens."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all beasts he learned the language,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned their names and all their secrets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the beavers built their lodges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the squirrels hid their acorns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the reindeer ran so swiftly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the rabbit was so timid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talked with them whene'er he met them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called them "Hiawatha's Brothers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Iagoo, the great boaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the marvellous story-teller,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the traveller and the talker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the friend of old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a bow for Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a branch of ash he made it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an oak-bough made the arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tipped with flint, and winged with feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cord he made of deer-skin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said to Hiawatha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, my son, into the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the red deer herd together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill for us a famous roebuck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill for us a deer with antlers!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into the forest straightway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone walked Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proudly, with his bow and arrows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the birds sang round him, o'er him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the oak-tree, close beside him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out among the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed, and said between his laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rabbit from his pathway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped aside, and at a distance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat erect upon his haunches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half in fear and half in frolic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying to the little hunter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he heeded not, nor heard them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his thoughts were with the red deer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their tracks his eyes were fastened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading downward to the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ford across the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as one in slumber walked he.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden in the alder-bushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he waited till the deer came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he saw two antlers lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw two eyes look from the thicket,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw two nostrils point to windward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a deer came down the pathway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flecked with leafy light and shadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heart within him fluttered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembled like the leaves above him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the birch-leaf palpitated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the deer came down the pathway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, upon one knee uprising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha aimed an arrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce a twig moved with his motion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wary roebuck started,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamped with all his hoofs together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened with one foot uplifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped as if to meet the arrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! the singing, fatal arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead he lay there in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the ford across the river;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat his timid heart no longer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the heart of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throbbed and shouted and exulted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he bore the red deer homeward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iagoo and Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailed his coming with applauses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the red deer's hide Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a cloak for Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the red deer's flesh Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a banquet to his honor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the village came and feasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the guests praised Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called him Strong-Heart, Soan-ge-taha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!

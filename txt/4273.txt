<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetry of earth is never dead:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the Grasshopper's, he takes the lead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summer luxury, he has never done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his delights; for when tired out with fun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a lone winter evening, when the frost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.

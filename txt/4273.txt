<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late two dainties were before me plac'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet, holy, pure, sacred and innocent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ninth sphere to me benignly sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Gods might know my own particular taste:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First the soft Bag-pipe mourn'd with zealous haste,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stranger next with head on bosom bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigh'd; rueful again the piteous Bag-pipe went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Stranger sighings fresh did waste.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Bag-pipe thou didst steal my heart away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Stranger thou didst re-assert thy sway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again thou Stranger gav'st me fresh alarm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! I could not choose. Ah! my poor heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mum chance art thou with both oblig'd to part.

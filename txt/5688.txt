<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the tales those merry guests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told to each other, well or ill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like summer birds that lift their crests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the borders of their nests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twitter, and again are still.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the tales, or new or old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In idle moments idly told;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers of the field with petals thin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilies that neither toil nor spin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tufts of wayside weeds and gorse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung in the parlor of the inn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the sign of the Red Horse.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still, reluctant to retire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friends sat talking by the fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watched the smouldering embers burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ashes, and flash up again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a momentary glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingering like them when forced to go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And going when they would remain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on the morrow they must turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their faces homeward, and the pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of parting touched with its unrest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tender nerve in every breast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sleep at last the victory won;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must be stirring with the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drowsily good night they said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went still gossiping to bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left the parlor wrapped in gloom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only live thing in the room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the old clock, that in its pace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept time with the revolving spheres
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And constellations in their flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And struck with its uplifted mace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark, unconscious hours of night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To senseless and unlistening ears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprose the sun; and every guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprisen, was soon equipped and dressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For journeying home and city-ward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old stage-coach was at the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With horses harnessed, long before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunshine reached the withered sward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the oaks, whose branches hoar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmured: "Farewell forevermore."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" the portly Landlord cried;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" the parting guests replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But little thought that nevermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their feet would pass that threshold o'er;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nevermore together there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would they assemble, free from care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear the oaks' mysterious roar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathe the wholesome country air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are they now?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What lands and skies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paint pictures in their friendly eyes?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What hope deludes, what promise cheers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What pleasant voices fill their ears?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two are beyond the salt sea waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three already in their graves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance the living still may look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the pages of this book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see the days of long ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating and fleeting to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the well-remembered brook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the inverted landscape gleam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their own faces like a dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up upon them from below.

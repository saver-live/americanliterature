<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AZRAEL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Solomon, before his palace gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At evening, on the pavement tessellate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was walking with a stranger from the East,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrayed in rich attire as for a feast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty Runjeet-Sing, a learned man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rajah of the realms of Hindostan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they walked the guest became aware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a white figure in the twilight air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing intent, as one who with surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His form and features seemed to recognize;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a whisper to the king he said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is yon shape, that, pallid as the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is watching me, as if he sought to trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim light the features of my face?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king looked, and replied: "I know him well;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Angel men call Azrael,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is the Death Angel; what hast thou to fear?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the guest answered: "Lest he should come near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speak to me, and take away my breath!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save me from Azrael, save me from death!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O king, that hast dominion o'er the wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bid it arise and bear me hence to Ind."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king gazed upward at the cloudless sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered a word, and raised his hand on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! the signet-ring of chrysoprase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his uplifted finger seemed to blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hidden fire, and rushing from the west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came a mighty wind, and seized the guest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lifted him from earth, and on they passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shining garments streaming in the blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silken banner o'er the walls upreared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purple cloud, that gleamed and disappeared.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the Angel, smiling: "If this man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be Rajah Runjeet-Sing of Hindostan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast done well in listening to his prayer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was upon my way to seek him there."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Edrehi, forbear to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ghostly legends of affright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the Talmud rest in peace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spare us your dismal tales of death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That almost take away one's breath;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So doing, may your tribe increase."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Sicilian said; then went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the spinet's rattling keys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played Marianina, like a breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Naples and the Southern seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings us the delicious scent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of citron and of orange trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And memories of soft days of ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Capri and Amalfi spent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so," the eager Poet said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least, not so before I tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of my Azrael,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel mortal as ourselves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which in an ancient tome I found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a convent's dusty shelves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chained with an iron chain, and bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parchment, and with clasps of brass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest from its prison, some dark day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be stolen or steal away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the good friars were singing mass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a tale of Charlemagne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When like a thunder-cloud, that lowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweeps from mountain-crest to coast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lightning flaming through its showers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swept across the Lombard plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beleaguering with his warlike train
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pavia, the country's pride and boast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of the Hundred Towers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus heralded the tale began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus in sober measure ran.

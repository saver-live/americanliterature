<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHARLEMAGNE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olger the Dane and Desiderio,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King of the Lombards, on a lofty tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood gazing northward o'er the rolling plains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;League after league of harvests, to the foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the snow-crested Alps, and saw approach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mighty army, thronging all the roads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That led into the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said unto Olger, who had passed his youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hostage at the court of France, and knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor's form and face "Is Charlemagne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among that host?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Olger answered: "No."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still the innumerable multitude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowed onward and increased, until the King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried in amazement: "Surely Charlemagne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is coming in the midst of all these knights!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Olger answered slowly: "No; not yet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not come so soon."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then much disturbed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Desiderio asked: "What shall we do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if he approach with a still greater army!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Olger answered: "When he shall appear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will behold what manner of man he is;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what will then befall us I know not."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the guard that never knew repose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladins of France; and at the sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lombard King o'ercome with terror cried:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This must be Charlemagne!" and as before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Olger answer: "No; not yet, not yet."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then appeared in panoply complete
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishops and the Abbots and the Priests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the imperial chapel, and the Counts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Desiderio could no more endure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of day, nor yet encounter death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sobbed aloud and said: "Let us go down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hide us in the bosom of the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the sight and anger of a foe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So terrible as this!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Olger said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you behold the harvests in the fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking with fear, the Po and the Ticino
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lashing the city walls with iron waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then may you know that Charlemagne is come.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even as he spake, in the northwest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! there uprose a black and threatening cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of whose bosom flashed the light of arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the people pent up in the city;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light more terrible than any darkness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Charlemagne appeared;--a Man of Iron!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His helmet was of iron, and his gloves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of iron, and his breastplate and his greaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tassets were of iron, and his shield.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his left hand he held an iron spear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his right hand his sword invincible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse he rode on had the strength of iron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And color of iron.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All who went before him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him and behind him, his whole host,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were armed with iron, and their hearts within them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were stronger than the armor that they wore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields and all the roads were filled with iron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And points of iron glistened in the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shed a terror through the city streets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This at a single glance Olger the Dane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw from the tower, and turning to the King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclaimed in haste: "Behold! this is the man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You looked for with such eagerness!" and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell as one dead at Desiderio's feet.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well pleased all listened to the tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drew, the Student said, its pith
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And marrow from the ancient myth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some one with an iron flail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that portentous Man of Brass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hephaestus made in days of yore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stalked about the Cretan shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the ships appear and pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threw stones at the Argonauts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being filled with indiscriminate ire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tangled and perplexed his thoughts;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, like a hospitable host,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When strangers landed on the coast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heated himself red-hot with fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hugged them in his arms, and pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bodies to his burning breast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet answered: "No, not thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend rose; it sprang at first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the hunger and the thirst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all men for the marvellous.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus it filled and satisfied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imagination of mankind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this ideal to the mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was truer than historic fact.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy enlarged and multiplied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenors of the awful name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Charlemagne, till he became
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armipotent in every act,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, clothed in mystery, appeared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not what men saw, but what they feared.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, unless my memory fail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your some one with an iron flail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not an ancient myth at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But comes much later on the scene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Talus in the Faerie Queene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron groom of Artegall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who threshed out falsehood and deceit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And truth upheld, and righted wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was, as is the swallow, fleet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the lion is, was strong."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian said: "Perchance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your chronicler in writing this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had in his mind the Anabasis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Xenophon describes the advance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Artaxerxes to the fight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first the low gray cloud of dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a blackness o'er the fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of a passing thunder-gust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then flash of brazen armor bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ranks of men, and spears up-thrust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowmen and troops with wicker shields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cavalry equipped in white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chariots ranged in front of these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With scythes upon their axle-trees."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this the Student answered: "Well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have a tale to tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Charlemagne; a tale that throws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A softer light, more tinged with rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than your grim apparition cast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the darkness of the past.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, and hear in English rhyme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the good Monk of Lauresheim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives as the gossip of his time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mediaeval Latin prose."

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm and still is the summer night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As here by the river's brink I wander;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White overhead are the stars, and white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glimmering lamps on the hillside yonder.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent are all the sounds of day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing I hear but the chirp of crickets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cry of the herons winging their way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the poet's house in the Elmwood thickets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call to him, herons, as slowly you pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your roosts in the haunts of the exiled thrushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing him the song of the green morass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tides that water the reeds and rushes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing him the mystical Song of the Hern,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the secret that baffles our utmost seeking;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For only a sound of lament we discern,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cannot interpret the words you are speaking.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing of the air, and the wild delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wings that uplift and winds that uphold you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy of freedom, the rapture of flight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the drift of the floating mists that infold you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the landscape lying so far below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its towns and rivers and desert places;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the splendor of light above, and the glow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the limitless, blue, ethereal spaces.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask him if songs of the Troubadours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of Minnesingers in old black-letter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound in his ears more sweet than yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if yours are not sweeter and wilder and better.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing to him, say to him, here at his gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the boughs of the stately elms are meeting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some one hath lingered to meditate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And send him unseen this friendly greeting;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That many another hath done the same,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not by a sound was the silence broken;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surest pledge of a deathless name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the silent homage of thoughts unspoken.

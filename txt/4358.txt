<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mortal body of a thousand days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now fills, O Burns, a space in thine own room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where thou didst dream alone on budded bays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy and thoughtless of thy day of doom!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pulse is warm with thine old barley-bree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My head is light with pledging a great soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes are wandering, and I cannot see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy is dead and drunken at its goal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet can I stamp my foot upon thy floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet can I ope thy window-sash to find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meadow thou hast tramped o'er and o'er,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet can I think of thee till thought is blind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet can I gulp a bumper to thy name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O smile among the shades, for this is fame!

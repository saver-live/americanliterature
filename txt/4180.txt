<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill for me a brimming bowl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in it let me drown my soul:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But put therein some drug, designed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Banish Women from my mind:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I want not the stream inspiring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fills the mind withfond desiring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want as deep a draught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As e'er from Lethe's wave was quaff'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my despairing heart to charm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Image of the fairest form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That e'er my reveling eyes beheld,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That e'er my wandering fancy spell'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain! away I cannot chace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melting softness of that face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beaminess of those bright eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That breastearth's only Paradise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sight will never more be blest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all I see has lost its zest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor with delight can I explore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Classic page, or Muse's lore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had she but known how beat my heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with one smile reliev'd its smart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have felt a sweet relief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have felt "the joy of grief."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet as the Tuscan mid the snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Lapland dreams on sweet Arno,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so for ever shall she be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Halo of my Memory.

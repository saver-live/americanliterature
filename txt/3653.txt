<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis mute, the word they went to hear on high Dodona mountain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When winds were in the oakenshaws and all the cauldrons tolled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mutes the midland navel-stone beside the singing fountain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And echoes list to silence now where gods told lies of old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took my question to the shrine that has not ceased from speaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart within, that tells the truth and tells it twice as plain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the cave of oracles I heard the priestess shrieking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she and I should surely die and never live again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh priestess, what you cry is clear, and sound good sense I think it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let the screaming echoes rest, and froth your mouth no more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis true theres better boose than brine, but he that drowns must drink it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, my lass, the news is news that men have heard before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King with half the East at heel is marched from lands of morning;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fighters drink the rivers up, their shafts benight the air.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he that stands will die for nought, and home theres no returning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spartans on the sea-wet rock sat down and combed their hair.

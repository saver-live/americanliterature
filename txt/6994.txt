<p><b>The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin</b></p><p></p><p>Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.</p><p>He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.</p><p>The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.</p><p>But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--</p><p>"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?"</p><p>But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--</p><p>Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.</p><p>He shut the door in Nutkin's face. Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--</p><p>The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.</p><p>But Nutkin gathered oak-apples-- yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.</p><p>On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.</p><p>They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.</p><p>Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in front, singing--</p><p>But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.</p><p>On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown. Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin.</p><p>But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--</p><p>Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.</p><p>The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins.</p><p>On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.</p><p>But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--</p><p>Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.</p><p>But he ate up the honey!</p><p>The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.</p><p>But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.</p><p>On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid EGG in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.</p><p>But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--</p><p>Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. But still he did not speak.</p><p>Nutkin became more and more impertinent--</p><p>Nutkin danced up and down like a SUNBEAM; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.</p><p>Nutkin began again--</p><p>Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown! . . .</p><p>Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud "Squeak!"</p><p>The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.</p><p>When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>BUT NUTKIN WAS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET!</p><p>This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.</p><p>Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase, and escaped out of the attic window.</p><p>And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--</p><p>"Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k!"</p><p></p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

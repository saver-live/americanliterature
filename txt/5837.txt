<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mather's Magnalia Christi,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the old colonial time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May be found in prose the legend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is here set down in rhyme.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ship sailed from New Haven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the keen and frosty airs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That filled her sails at parting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were heavy with good men's prayers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Lord! if it be thy pleasure"--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus prayed the old divine--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To bury our friends in the ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take them, for they are thine!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Master Lamberton muttered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under his breath said he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ship is so crank and walty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear our grave she will be!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ships that came from England,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the winter months were gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought no tidings of this vessel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor of Master Lamberton.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This put the people to praying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Lord would let them hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What in his greater wisdom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had done with friends so dear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at last their prayers were answered:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in the month of June,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour before the sunset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a windy afternoon,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, steadily steering landward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ship was seen below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they knew it was Lamberton, Master,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sailed so long ago.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On she came, with a cloud of canvas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right against the wind that blew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the eye could distinguish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the crew.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fell her straining topmasts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging tangled in the shrouds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her sails were loosened and lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blown away like clouds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the masts, with all their rigging,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell slowly, one by one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hulk dilated and vanished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a sea-mist in the sun!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people who saw this marvel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each said unto his friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this was the mould of their vessel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus her tragic end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pastor of the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave thanks to God in prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, to quiet their troubled spirits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had sent this Ship of Air.

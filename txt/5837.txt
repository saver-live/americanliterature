<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the market-place of Bruges stands the belfry old and brown;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice consumed and thrice rebuilded, still it watches o'er the town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the summer morn was breaking, on that lofty tower I stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world threw off the darkness, like the weeds of widowhood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick with towns and hamlets studded, and with streams and vapors gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a shield embossed with silver, round and vast the landscape lay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my feet the city slumbered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its chimneys, here and there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wreaths of snow-white smoke, ascending, vanished, ghost-like, into air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a sound rose from the city at that early morning hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I heard a heart of iron beating in the ancient tower.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their nests beneath the rafters sang the swallows wild and high;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world, beneath me sleeping, seemed more distant than the sky.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then most musical and solemn, bringing back the olden times,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their strange, unearthly changes rang the melancholy chimes,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the psalms from some old cloister, when the nuns sing in the choir;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great bell tolled among them, like the chanting of a friar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visions of the days departed, shadowy phantoms filled my brain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who live in history only seemed to walk the earth again;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Foresters of Flanders,--mighty Baldwin Bras de Fer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyderick du Bucq and Cressy Philip, Guy de Dampierre.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beheld the pageants splendid that adorned those days of old;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stately dames, like queens attended, knights who bore the Fleece of Gold

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lombard and Venetian merchants with deep-laden argosies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers from twenty nations; more than royal pomp and ease.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beheld proud Maximilian, kneeling humbly on the ground;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beheld the gentle Mary, hunting with her hawk and hound;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her lighted bridal-chamber, where a duke slept with the queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the armed guard around them, and the sword unsheathed between.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beheld the Flemish weavers, with Namur and Juliers bold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marching homeward from the bloody battle of the Spurs of Gold;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the light at Minnewater, saw the White Hoods moving west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw great Artevelde victorious scale the Golden Dragon's nest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again the whiskered Spaniard all the land with terror smote;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again the wild alarum sounded from the tocsin's throat;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the bell of Ghent responded o'er lagoon and dike of sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Roland!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Roland! there is victory in the land!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the sound of drums aroused me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awakened city's roar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chased the phantoms I had summoned back into their graves once more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours had passed away like minutes; and, before I was aware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the shadow of the belfry crossed the sun-illumined square.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It keeps eternal whisperings around
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desolate shores, and with its mighty swell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gluts twice ten thousand caverns, till the spell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Hecate leaves them their old shadowy sound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often 'tis in such gentle temper found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scarcely will the very smallest shell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be mov'd for days from whence it sometime fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When last the winds of heaven were unbound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh ye! who have your eye-balls vex'd and tir'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feast them upon the wideness of the Sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh ye! whose ears are dinn'd with uproar rude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or fed too much with cloying melody,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit ye near some old cavern's mouth, and brood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until ye start, as if the sea-nymphs quir'd!

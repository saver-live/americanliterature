<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature withheld Cassandra in the skies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more adornment a full thousand years;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took their cream of Beauty's fairest dyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shap'd and tinted her above all Peers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Love kept her dearly with his wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And underneath their shadow fill'd her eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a richness that the cloudy Kings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of high Olympus utter'd slavish sighs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When from the Heavens I saw her first descend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart took fire, and only burning pains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were my pleasures, they my Life's sad end;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love pour'd her beauty into my warm veins.

LAME and flower and the blue,
⁠While a breath from far Eden blows,
And the old earth born anew,
⁠And the east a bursting rose.

Music of birds and bees,
⁠Wild and full as the Dorian mood,
The whir of the wing, and the breeze
⁠Bringing the spice of the wood.

Dear the dreams of the night,
⁠And sweet are the hours that are gone.
But sweeter the hour in its flight
⁠Of a dew-drenched summer dawn!

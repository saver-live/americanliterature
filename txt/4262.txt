<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church bells toll a melancholy round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling the people to some other prayers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other gloominess, more dreadful cares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More hearkening to the sermon's horrid sound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the mind of man is closely bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some black spell; seeing that each one tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself from fireside joys, and Lydian airs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And converse high of those with glory crown'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, still they toll, and I should feel a damp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chill as from a tomb, did I not know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they are dying like an outburnt lamp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That 'tis their sighing, wailing ere they go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into oblivion; that fresh flowers will grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many glories of immortal stamp.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me not here, it needs not saying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What tune the enchantress plays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In aftermaths of soft September
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or under blanching mays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she and I were long acquainted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I knew all her ways.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On russet floors, by waters idle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pine lets fall its cone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cuckoo shouts all day at nothing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leafy dells alone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And travelers joy beguiles in autumn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts that have lost their own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On acres of the seeded grasses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing burnish heaves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or marshalled under moons of harvest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand still all night the sheaves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or beeches strip in storms for winter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stain the wind with leaves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possess, as I possessed a season,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countries I resign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where over elmy plains the highway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would mount the hills and shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full of shade the pillared forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would murmur and be mine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nature, heartless, witless nature,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will neither care nor know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What strangers feet may find the meadow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trespass there and go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ask amid the dews of morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are mine or no.

<p>The short list of great American novels is often topped by Nathaniel Hawthorne's <span class="al-title">The Scarlet Letter</span>. This classic novel from the cannon of American Literature exemplifies the genre of <a href="/dark-romanticism-study-guide">Dark Romanticism</a>. In this story, the consequences of Hester Prynne's adulterous affair with the reverend Arthur Dimmesdale are borne out as she gives birth to their child and is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter <b style="color:darkred;">A</b>, embroidered on her bosom, as a sign of her adultery. Hawthorne is at his best as he treats with the complexities of sin and redemption as the story progresses and carries <span class="al-char">Hester Prynne</span>, <span class="al-char">Arthur Dimmesdale</span> and <span class="al-char">Pearl</span> toward their respective destinies. <i>Illustration at right by Mary Hallock Foote, 1878.</i> We offer a useful <a href="/the-scarlet-letter-study-guide">The Scarlet Letter Study Guide</a> for students and teachers. </p><p>The novel is classified under the <a href="/romanticism-study-guide">Romantic</a> genre and further classified as <a href="/dark-romanticism-study-guide">Dark Romanticism</a> and <a href="/dystopian-stories">Dystopian Fiction</a>. I urge readers to study rather than skip over the two introductory chapters; <span class="al-periodical">"Preface to the Second Edition"</span> and <span class="al-periodical">"The Custom-House."</span> Those two works do not appear alongside the novel by accident, and I believe an appreciation of Hawthorne's experience at the Customs House is the key to a deeper understanding of the novel itself.</p><p>This novel is a rare work of art. If you are reading it for a class, please cast aside any and all academic considerations. Don't let the assignment intrude on the experience. Enjoy the story as a reader instead of a student. You will have plenty of time for the classroom considerations, but you will probably only read the story once. So do it right. Good luck and most of all, <em><b>enjoy it!</b></em> </p><p><span class="al-title">The Scarlet Letter</span> is a true masterpiece of American Literature and a must-read for every student of literature.

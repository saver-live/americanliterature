<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIZABETH

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, how short are the days!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How soon the night overtakes us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old country the twilight is longer; but here in the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly comes the dark, with hardly a pause in its coming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly a moment between the two lights, the day and the lamplight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet how grand is the winter!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How spotless the snow is, and perfect!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus spake Elizabeth Haddon at nightfall to Hannah the housemaid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the farm-house kitchen, that served for kitchen and parlor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the window she sat with her work, and looked on a landscape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White as the great white sheet that Peter saw in his vision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the four corners let down and descending out of the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered with snow were the forests of pine, and the fields and the meadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing was dark but the sky, and the distant Delaware flowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from its native hills, a peaceful and bountiful river.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a smile on her lips made answer Hannah the housemaid:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful winter! yea, the winter is beautiful, surely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one could only walk like a fly with one's feet on the ceiling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the great Delaware River is not like the Thames, as we saw it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of our upper windows in Rotherhithe Street in the Borough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowded with masts and sails of vessels coming and going;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here there is nothing but pines, with patches of snow on their branches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is snow in the air, and see! it is falling already;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the roads will be blocked, and I pity Joseph to-morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking his way through the drifts, with his sled and oxen; and then, too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How in all the world shall we get to Meeting on First-Day?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Elizabeth checked her, and answered, mildly reproving:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely the Lord will provide; for unto the snow he sayeth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be thou on the earth, the good Lord sayeth; he is it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giveth snow like wool, like ashes scatters the hoar-frost."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she folded her work and laid it away in her basket.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Hannah the housemaid had closed and fastened the shutters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the cloth, and lighted the lamp on the table, and placed there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plates and cups from the dresser, the brown rye loaf, and the butter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh from the dairy, and then, protecting her hand with a holder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took from the crane in the chimney the steaming and simmering kettle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poised it aloft in the air, and filled up the earthen teapot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made in Delft, and adorned with quaint and wonderful figures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elizabeth said, "Lo! Joseph is long on his errand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sent him away with a hamper of food and of clothing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the poor in the village.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good lad and cheerful is Joseph;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the right place is his heart, and his hand is ready and willing."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus in praise of her servant she spake, and Hannah the housemaid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed with her eyes, as she listened, but governed her tongue, and was silent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While her mistress went on: "The house is far from the village;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be lonely here, were it not for Friends that in passing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes tarry o'ernight, and make us glad by their coming."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon answered Hannah the housemaid, the thrifty, the frugal:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, they come and they tarry, as if thy house were a tavern;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open to all are its doors, and they come and go like the pigeons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out of the holes of the pigeon-house over the hayloft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooing and smoothing their feathers and basking themselves in the sunshine."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in meekness of spirit, and calmly, Elizabeth answered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All I have is the Lord's, not mine to give or withhold it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I but distribute his gifts to the poor, and to those of his people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in journeyings often surrender their lives to his service.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His, not mine, are the gifts, and only so far can I make them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine, as in giving I add my heart to whatever is given.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore my excellent father first built this house in the clearing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he came not himself, I came; for the Lord was my guidance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading me here for this service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not grudge, then, to others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever the cup of cold water, or crumbs that fall from our table."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus rebuked, for a season was silent the penitent housemaid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Elizabeth said in tones even sweeter and softer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dost thou remember, Hannah, the great May-Meeting in London,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was still a child, how we sat in the silent assembly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting upon the Lord in patient and passive submission?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one spake, till at length a young man, a stranger, John Estaugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved by the Spirit, rose, as if he were John the Apostle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking such words of power that they bowed our hearts, as a strong wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bends the grass of the fields, or grain that is ripe for the sickle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts of him to-day have been oft borne inward upon me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore I do not know; but strong is the feeling within me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That once more I shall see a face I have never forgotten."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en as she spake they heard the musical jangle of sleigh-bells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First far off, with a dreamy sound and faint in the distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then growing nearer and louder, and turning into the farmyard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it stopped at the door, with sudden creaking of runners.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were voices heard as of two men talking together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to herself, as she listened, upbraiding said Hannah the housemaid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Joseph come back, and I wonder what stranger is with him?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from its nail she took and lighted the great tin lantern
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierced with holes, and round, and roofed like the top of a lighthouse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went forth to receive the coming guest at the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casting into the dark a network of glimmer and shadow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the falling snow, the yellow sleigh, and the horses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the forms of men, snow-covered, looming gigantic.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then giving Joseph the lantern, she entered the house with the stranger.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youthful he was and tall, and his cheeks aglow with the night air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he entered, Elizabeth rose, and, going to meet him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if an unseen power had announced and preceded his presence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he had come as one whose coming had long been expected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly gave him her hand, and said, "Thou art welcome, John Estaugh."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stranger replied, with staid and quiet behavior,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dost thou remember me still, Elizabeth?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so many
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years have passed, it seemeth a wonderful thing that I find thee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the hand of the Lord conducted me here to thy threshold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as I journeyed along, and pondered alone and in silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his ways, that are past finding out, I saw in the snow-mist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemingly weary with travel, a wayfarer, who by the wayside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused and waited.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith I remembered Queen Candace's eunuch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How on the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading Esaias the Prophet, he journeyed, and spake unto Philip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praying him to come up and sit in his chariot with him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I greeted the man, and he mounted the sledge beside me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as we talked on the way he told me of thee and thy homestead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, being led by the light of the Spirit, that never deceiveth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of zeal for the work of the Lord, thou hadst come to this country.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I remembered thy name, and thy father and mother in England,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on my journey have stopped to see thee, Elizabeth Haddon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wishing to strengthen thy hand in the labors of love thou art doing."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Elizabeth answered with confident voice, and serenely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking into his face with her innocent eyes as she answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely the hand of the Lord is in it; his Spirit hath led thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the darkness and storm to the light and peace of my fireside."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with stamping of feet, the door was opened, and Joseph
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered, bearing the lantern, and, carefully blowing the light out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rung it up on its nail, and all sat down to their supper;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For underneath that roof was no distinction of persons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one family only, one heart, one hearth and one household.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the supper was ended they drew their chairs to the fireplace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spacious, open-hearted, profuse of flame and of firewood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of forests unfelled, and not a gleaner of fagots,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading its arms to embrace with inexhaustible bounty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All who fled from the cold, exultant, laughing at winter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Hannah the housemaid was busy in clearing the table,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming and going, and hustling about in closet and chamber.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elizabeth told her story again to John Estaugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going far back to the past, to the early days of her childhood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How she had waited and watched, in all her doubts and besetments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comforted with the extendings and holy, sweet inflowings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the spirit of love, till the voice imperative sounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she obeyed the voice, and cast in her lot with her people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in the desert land, and God would provide for the issue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Joseph sat with folded hands, and demurely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened, or seemed to listen, and in the silence that followed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing was heard for a while but the step of Hannah the housemaid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking the floor overhead, and setting the chambers in order.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Elizabeth said, with a smile of compassion, "The maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath a light heart in her breast, but her feet are heavy and awkward."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inwardly Joseph laughed, but governed his tongue, and was silent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the hour of sleep, death's counterfeit, nightly rehearsal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the great Silent Assembly, the Meeting of shadows, where no man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaketh, but all are still, and the peace and rest are unbroken!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently over that house the blessing of slumber descended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the morning dawned, and the sun uprose in his splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking his way through clouds that encumbered his path in the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph was seen with his sled and oxen breaking a pathway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the drifts of snow; the horses already were harnessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And John Estaugh was standing and taking leave at the threshold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying that he should return at the Meeting in May; while above them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hannah the housemaid, the homely, was looking out of the attic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing aloud at Joseph, then suddenly closing the casement,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the bird in a cuckoo-clock peeps out of its window,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then disappears again, and closes the shutter behind it.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now was the winter gone, and the snow; and Robin the Redbreast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasted on bush and tree it was he, it was he and no other
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had covered with leaves the Babes in the Wood, and blithely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the birds sang with him, and little cared for his boasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or for his Babes in the Wood, or the Cruel Uncle, and only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang for the mates they had chosen, and cared for the nests they were building.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them, but more sedately and meekly, Elizabeth Haddon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang in her inmost heart, but her lips were silent and songless.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus came the lovely spring with a rush of blossoms and music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding the earth with flowers, and the air with melodies vernal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it came to pass, one pleasant morning, that slowly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the road there came a cavalcade, as of pilgrims
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men and women, wending their way to the Quarterly Meeting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the neighboring town; and with them came riding John Estaugh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Elizabeth's door they stopped to rest, and alighting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasted the currant wine, and the bread of rye, and the honey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought from the hives, that stood by the sunny wall of the garden;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then remounted their horses, refreshed, and continued their journey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Elizabeth with them, and Joseph, and Hannah the housemaid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as they started, Elizabeth lingered a little, and leaning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over her horse's neck, in a whisper said to John Estaugh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tarry awhile behind, for I have something to tell thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be spoken lightly, nor in the presence of others;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them it concerneth not, only thee and me it concerneth."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they rode slowly along through the woods, conversing together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasure to breathe the fragrant air of the forest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasure to live on that bright and happy May morning!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elizabeth said, though still with a certain reluctance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if impelled to reveal a secret she fain would have guarded:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will no longer conceal what is laid upon me to tell thee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received from the Lord a charge to love thee, John Estaugh."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And John Estaugh made answer, surprised by the words she had spoken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pleasant to me are thy converse, thy ways, thy meekness of spirit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant thy frankness of speech, and thy soul's immaculate whiteness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love without dissimulation, a holy and inward adorning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have yet no light to lead me, no voice to direct me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Lord's work is done, and the toil and the labor completed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath appointed to me, I will gather into the stillness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my own heart awhile, and listen and wait for his guidance."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elizabeth said, not troubled nor wounded in spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So is it best, John Estaugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not speak of it further.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hath been laid upon me to tell thee this, for to-morrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art going away, across the sea, and I know not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I shall see thee more; but if the Lord hath decreed it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt return again to seek me here and to find me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they rode onward in silence, and entered the town with the others.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ships that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now went on as of old the quiet life of the homestead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient and unrepining Elizabeth labored, in all things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindful not of herself, but bearing the burdens of others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always thoughtful and kind and untroubled; and Hannah the housemaid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diligent early and late, and rosy with washing and scouring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still as of old disparaged the eminent merits of Joseph,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was at times reproved for her light and frothy behavior,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her shy looks, and her careless words, and her evil surmisings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being pressed down somewhat like a cart with sheaves overladen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she would sometimes say to Joseph, quoting the Scriptures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile John Estaugh departed across the sea, and departing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carried hid in his heart a secret sacred and precious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling its chambers with fragrance, and seeming to him in its sweetness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's ointment of spikenard, that filled all the house with its odor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O lost days of delight, that are wasted in doubting and waiting!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O lost hours and days in which we might have been happy!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the light shone at last, and guided his wavering footsteps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at last came the voice, imperative, questionless, certain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then John Estaugh came back o'er the sea for the gift that was offered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than houses and lands, the gift of a woman's affection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the First-Day that followed, he rose in the Silent Assembly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding in his strong hand a hand that trembled a little,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promising to be kind and true and faithful in all things.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the marriage-rites of John and Elizabeth Estaugh.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not otherwise Joseph, the honest, the diligent servant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sped in his bashful wooing with homely Hannah the housemaid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when he asked her the question, she answered, "Nay"; and then added
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But thee may make believe, and see what will come of it, Joseph."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pleasant and a winsome tale,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student said, "though somewhat pale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quiet in its coloring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it caught its tone and air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gray suits that Quakers wear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet worthy of some German bard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebel, or Voss, or Eberhard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who love of humble themes to sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In humble verse; but no more true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than was the tale I told to you."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian made reply,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with some warmth, "That I deny;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is no invention of my own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But something well and widely known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To readers of a riper age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ by the skilful hand that wrote
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian tale of Hobomok,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Philothea's classic page.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it like a waif afloat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or dulse uprooted from its rock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the swift tides that ebb and flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In daily papers, and at flood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear freighted vessels to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But later, when the ebb is low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave a long waste of sand and mud."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It matters little," quoth the Jew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cloak of truth is lined with lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sayeth some proverb old and wise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love is master of all arts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And puts it into human hearts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strangest things to say and do."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here the controversy closed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abruptly, ere 't was well begun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Sicilian interposed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With, "Lordlings, listen, every one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That listen may, unto a tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's merrier than the nightingale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale that cannot boast, forsooth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single rag or shred of truth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not leave the mind in doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the with it or without;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A naked falsehood and absurd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mortal ever told or heard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I tell it; or, maybe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply because it pleases me."

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time to put off the world and go somewhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And find my health again in the sea air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make my soul before my pate is bare.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And get a comfortable wife and house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rid me of the devil in my shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the worse devil that is between my thighs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though Id marry with a comely lass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She need not be too comely, let it pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But theres a devil in a looking-glass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor should she be too rich, because the rich
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cannot have a humorous happy speech.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there Ill grow respected at my ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear amid the gardens nightly peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind-blown clamour of the barnacle-geese.

<p>See how the Yellow River's water move out of heaven.<br> Entering the ocean,never to return.<br> See how lovely locks in bright mirrors in high chambers,<br> Though silken-black at morning, have changed by night to snow.<br> ... Oh, let a man of spirit venture where he pleases<br> And never tip his golden cup empty toward the moon!<br> Since heaven gave the talent, let it be employed!<br> Spin a thousand of pieces of silver, all of them come back!<br> Cook a sheep, kill a cow, whet the appetite,<br> And make me, of three hundred bowls, one long drink!<br> ... To the old master, Tsen,<br> And the young scholar, Tan-chiu,<br> Bring in the wine!<br> Let your cups never rest!<br> Let me sing you a song!<br> Let your ears attend!<br> What are bell and drum, rare dishes and treasure?<br> Let me br forever drunk and never come to reason!<br> Sober men of olden days and sages are forgotten,<br> And only the great drinkers are famous for all time.<br> ... Prince Chen paid at a banquet in the Palace of Perfection<br> Ten thousand coins for a cask of wine, with many a laugh and quip.<br> Why say, my host, that your money is gone?<br> Go and buy wine and we'll drink it together!<br> My flower-dappled horse,<br> My furs worth a thousand,<br> Hand them to the boy to exchange for good wine,<br> And we'll drown away the woes of ten thousand generation! <br></p>

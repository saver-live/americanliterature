<p>AH, from the niggard tree of Time<br> How quickly fall the hours!<br> It needs no touch of wind or rime<br> To loose such facile flowers.<br> <br> Drift of the dead year's harvesting,<br> They clog to-morrow's way,<br> Yet serve to shelter growths of spring<br> Beneath their warm decay,<br> <br> Or, blent by pious hands with rare<br> Sweet savours of content,<br> Surprise the soul's December air<br> With June's forgotten scent.</p>

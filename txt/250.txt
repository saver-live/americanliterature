<p>The just man followed God's messenger,<br> Vast and bright against the black hill,<br> But care spoke in the woman's ear:<br> 'There's time, you can look back still,<br> <br> At Sodom's red towers where you were born,<br> The square where you sang, where you'd spin,<br> The high windows of your dark home,<br> Where your children's lives entered in.'<br> <br> She looked, and was transfixed by pain,<br> Unsure whether she could still see,<br> Her body had turned to translucent salt,<br> Her quick feet rooted there, like a tree.<br> <br> A loss, but who still mourns the breath<br> Of one woman, or laments one wife?<br> Though my heart can never forget,<br> How, for one look, she gave up her life.<br> <br> (The reference is to Lot's wife in Genesis 19:26)<br></p>

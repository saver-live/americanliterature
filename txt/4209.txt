&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no! go not to Lethe, neither twist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make not your rosary of yew-berries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shade to shade will come too drowsily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the melancholy fit shall fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dwells with Beauty, Beauty that must die;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, in the very temple of Delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be among her cloudy trophies hung.

<p>A string of little beads at my neck,<br> In a broad muff I hide my hands,<br> The eyes stare vacantly,<br> They never shed a tear.<br> <br> And the face appears pale,<br> Against the lavender silk,<br> My straight bangs<br> Almost reach my eyebrows.<br> <br> And how dissimilar to flight<br> Is my halting step,<br> As if it were a raft beneath my feet,<br> Not these wooden parquet squares.<br> <br> And the pale lips are slightly parted,<br> The breathing laboured and uneven,<br> And over my heart tremble<br> The flowers of a non-existent meeting.<br></p>

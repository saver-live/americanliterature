<p>SET wide the window. Let me drink the day.<br> I loved light ever, light in eye and brain--<br> No tapers mirrored in long palace floors,<br> Nor dedicated depths of silent aisles,<br> But just the common dusty wind-blown day<br> That roofs earth's millions.<br> <br> O, too long I walked<br> In that thrice-sifted air that princes breathe,<br> Nor felt the heaven-wide jostling of the winds<br> And all the ancient outlawry of earth!<br> Now let me breathe and see.<br> <br> This pilgrimage<br> They call a penance--let them call it that!<br> I set my face to the East to shrive my soul<br> Of mortal sin? So be it. If my blade<br> Once questioned living flesh, if once I tore<br> The pages of the Book in opening it,<br> See what the torn page yielded ere the light<br> Had paled its buried characters--and judge!<br> <br> The girl they brought me, pinioned hand and foot<br> In catalepsy--say I should have known<br> That trance had not yet darkened into death,<br> And held my scalpel. Well, suppose I _knew?_<br> Sum up the facts--her life against her death.<br> Her life? The scum upon the pools of pleasure<br> Breeds such by thousands. And her death? Perchance<br> The obolus to appease the ferrying Shade,<br> And waft her into immortality.<br> Think what she purchased with that one heart-flutter<br> That whispered its deep secret to my blade!<br> For, just because her bosom fluttered still,<br> It told me more than many rifled graves;<br> Because I spoke too soon, she answered me,<br> Her vain life ripened to this bud of death<br> As the whole plant is forced into one flower,<br> All her blank past a scroll on which God wrote<br> His word of healing--so that the poor flesh,<br> Which spread death living, died to purchase life!<br> <br> Ah, no! The sin I sinned was mine, not theirs.<br> Not _that_ they sent me forth to wash away--<br> None of their tariffed frailties, but a deed<br> So far beyond their grasp of good or ill<br> That, set to weigh it in the Church's balance,<br> Scarce would they know which scale to cast it in.<br> But I, I know. I sinned against my will,<br> Myself, my soul--the God within the breast:<br> Can any penance wash such sacrilege?<br> <br> When I was young in Venice, years ago,<br> I walked the hospice with a Spanish monk,<br> A solitary cloistered in high thoughts,<br> The great Loyola, whom I reckoned then<br> A mere refurbisher of faded creeds,<br> Expert to edge anew the arms of faith,<br> As who should say, a Galenist, resolved<br> To hold the walls of dogma against fact,<br> Experience, insight, his own self, if need be!<br> Ah, how I pitied him, mine own eyes set<br> Straight in the level beams of Truth, who groped<br> In error's old deserted catacombs<br> And lit his tapers upon empty graves!<br> Ay, but he held his own, the monk--more man<br> Than any laurelled cripple of the wars,<br> Charles's spent shafts; for what he willed he willed,<br> As those do that forerun the wheels of fate,<br> Not take their dust--that force the virgin hours,<br> Hew life into the likeness of themselves<br> And wrest the stars from their concurrences.<br> So firm his mould; but mine the ductile soul<br> That wears the livery of circumstance<br> And hangs obsequious on its suzerain's eye.<br> For who rules now? The twilight-flitting monk,<br> Or I, that took the morning like an Alp?<br> He held his own, I let mine slip from me,<br> The birthright that no sovereign can restore;<br> And so ironic Time beholds us now<br> Master and slave--he lord of half the earth,<br> I ousted from my narrow heritage.<br> <br> For there's the sting! My kingdom knows me not.<br> Reach me that folio--my usurper's title!<br> Fallopius reigning, _vice_--nay, not so:<br> Successor, not usurper. I am dead.<br> My throne stood empty; he was heir to it.<br> Ay, but who hewed his kingdom from the waste,<br> Cleared, inch by inch, the acres for his sowing,<br> Won back for man that ancient fief o' the Church,<br> His body? Who flung Galen from his seat,<br> And founded the great dynasty of truth<br> In error's central kingdom?<br> <br> Ask men that,<br> And see their answer: just a wondering stare<br> To learn things were not always as they are--<br> The very fight forgotten with the fighter;<br> Already grows the moss upon my grave!<br> Ay, and so meet--hold fast to that, Vesalius.<br> They only, who re-conquer day by day<br> The inch of ground they camped on over-night,<br> Have right of foothold on this crowded earth.<br> I left mine own; he seized it; with it went<br> My name, my fame, my very self, it seems,<br> Till I am but the symbol of a man,<br> The sign-board creaking o'er an empty inn.<br> He names me--true! _Oh, give the door its due_<br> _I entered by. Only, I pray you, note,_<br> _Had door been none, a shoulder-thrust of mine_<br> _Had breached the crazy wall"_--he seems to say.<br> So meet--and yet a word of thanks, of praise,<br> Of recognition that the clue was found,<br> Seized, followed, clung to, by some hand now dust--<br> Had this obscured his quartering of my shield?<br> <br> How the one weakness stirs again! I thought<br> I had done with that old thirst for gratitude<br> That lured me to the desert years ago.<br> I did my work--and was not that enough?<br> No; but because the idlers sneered and shrugged,<br> The envious whispered, the traducers lied,<br> And friendship doubted where it should have cheered<br> I flung aside the unfinished task, sought praise<br> Outside my soul's esteem, and learned too late<br> That victory, like God's kingdom, is within.<br> (Nay, let the folio rest upon my knee.<br> I do not feel its weight.) Ingratitude?<br> The hurrying traveller does not ask the name<br> Of him who points him on his way; and this<br> Fallopius sits in the mid-heart of me,<br> Because he keeps his eye upon the goal,<br> Cuts a straight furrow to the end in view,<br> Cares not who oped the fountain by the way,<br> But drinks to draw fresh courage for his journey.<br> That was the lesson that Ignatius taught--<br> The one I might have learned from him, but would not--<br> That we are but stray atoms on the wind,<br> A dancing transiency of summer eves,<br> Till we become one with our purpose, merged<br> In that vast effort of the race which makes<br> Mortality immortal.<br> <br> _"He that loseth_<br> _His life shall find it":_ so the Scripture runs.<br> But I so hugged the fleeting self in me,<br> So loved the lovely perishable hours,<br> So kissed myself to death upon their lips,<br> That on one pyre we perished in the end--<br> A grimmer bonfire than the Church e'er lit!<br> Yet all was well--or seemed so--till I heard<br> That younger voice, an echo of my own,<br> And, like a wanderer turning to his home,<br> Who finds another on the hearth, and learns,<br> Half-dazed, that other is his actual self<br> In name and claim, as the whole parish swears,<br> So strangely, suddenly, stood dispossessed<br> Of that same self I had sold all to keep,<br> A baffled ghost that none would see or hear!<br> _"Vesalius? Who's Vesalius? This Fallopius_<br> _It is who dragged the Galen-idol down,_<br> _Who rent the veil of flesh and forced a way_<br> _Into the secret fortalice of life"_--<br> Yet it was I that bore the brunt of it!<br> <br> Well, better so! Better awake and live<br> My last brief moment as the man I was,<br> Than lapse from life's long lethargy to death<br> Without one conscious interval. At least<br> I repossess my past, am once again<br> No courtier med'cining the whims of kings<br> In muffled palace-chambers, but the free<br> Friendless Vesalius, with his back to the wall<br> And all the world against him. O, for that<br> Best gift of all, Fallopius, take my thanks--<br> That, and much more. At first, when Padua wrote:<br> "Master, Fallopius dead, resume again<br> The chair even he could not completely fill,<br> And see what usury age shall take of youth<br> In honours forfeited"--why, just at first,<br> I was quite simply credulously glad<br> To think the old life stood ajar for me,<br> Like a fond woman's unforgetting heart.<br> But now that death waylays me--now I know<br> This isle is the circumference of my days,<br> And I shall die here in a little while--<br> So also best, Fallopius!<br> <br> For I see<br> The gods may give anew, but not restore;<br> And though I think that, in my chair again,<br> I might have argued my supplanters wrong<br> In this or that--this Cesalpinus, say,<br> With all his hot-foot blundering in the dark,<br> Fabricius, with his over-cautious clutch<br> On Galen (systole and diastole<br> Of Truth's mysterious heart!)--yet, other ways,<br> It may be that this dying serves the cause.<br> For Truth stays not to build her monument<br> For this or that co-operating hand,<br> But props it with her servants' failures--nay,<br> Cements its courses with their blood and brains,<br> A living substance that shall clinch her walls<br> Against the assaults of time. Already, see,<br> Her scaffold rises on my hidden toil,<br> I but the accepted premiss whence must spring<br> The airy structure of her argument;<br> Nor could the bricks it rests on serve to build<br> The crowning finials. I abide her law:<br> A different substance for a different end--<br> Content to know I hold the building up;<br> Though men, agape at dome and pinnacles,<br> Guess not, the whole must crumble like a dream<br> But for that buried labour underneath.<br> Yet, Padua, I had still my word to say!<br> _Let others say it!_--Ah, but will they guess<br> Just the one word--? Nay, Truth is many-tongued.<br> What one man failed to speak, another finds<br> Another word for. May not all converge<br> In some vast utterance, of which you and I,<br> Fallopius, were but halting syllables?<br> So knowledge come, no matter how it comes!<br> No matter whence the light falls, so it fall!<br> Truth's way, not mine--that I, whose service failed<br> In action, yet may make amends in praise.<br> Fabricius, Cesalpinus, say your word,<br> Not yours, or mine, but Truth's, as you receive it!<br> You miss a point I saw? See others, then!<br> Misread my meaning? Yet expound your own!<br> Obscure one space I cleared? The sky is wide,<br> And you may yet uncover other stars.<br> For thus I read the meaning of this end:<br> There are two ways of spreading light: to be<br> The candle or the mirror that reflects it.<br> I let my wick burn out--there yet remains<br> To spread an answering surface to the flame<br> That others kindle.<br> <br> Turn me in my bed.<br> The window darkens as the hours swing round;<br> But yonder, look, the other casement glows!<br> Let me face westward as my sun goes down.</p>

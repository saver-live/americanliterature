<p><cite class="al-title">Pygmalion</cite> (1912) was Shaw's best known play, about Henry Higgins' experiment as a professor of phonetics teaching cockney English girl, Eliza Doolittle to speak like an aristocratic lady. <i>[Photo on the right is of the 1914 production.]</i> The popular play was adapted into a popular American movie musical, <cite class="al-title">My Fair Lady</cite> in 1964, starring <cite class="al-person">Audrey Hepburn</cite> and <cite class="al-person">Rex Harrison</cite>. Who can forget her break-through recitation of, <i>"The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain</i>" and <cite class="al-person">Julie Andrews</cite> singing <i>"I could have danced all night"</i> in the 1954 production. The play's title comes from ancient Greek mythology, in which Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures, which then came to life. So too, does Henry Higgins with his "creation."</p><p><img alt="Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion adapted as My Fair Lady, 1964" title="Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion adapted as My Fair Lady, 1964" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/play/my-fair-lady-1964.jpg" style="max-width:285px; float:left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3736061155" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p><p><a href="preface">Preface</a></p><p><a href="act-i">Act I</a></p><p><a href="act-ii">Act II</a></p><p><a href="act-iii">Act III</a></p><p><a href="act-iv">Act IV</a></p><p><a href="act-v">Act V</a></p><p><a href="the-rest-of-the-story">The Rest of the Story</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/bernard-shaw">Bernard Shaw</a> library. </p>

<p>The sound of these words may be large but facts do not bear out the theory, for eclipses do not appear to have captivated our great poets to anything like the extent that Moon, Stars, and Comets have done. </p><p><img alt="Solar Eclipse May 28, 1900" title="Solar prominences of the Eclipse, May 28, 1900" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/the-eclipse-may-28-1900.jpg" style="max-width:600px; float:center; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1741007896" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"></p><p>Shakespeare has a few allusions to eclipses, but they are not of prime importance. In Macbeth we find:— </p><p>the precise meaning of which is not very obvious. “Shivered” of course means divided into pieces, but the idea intended is obscure.</p><p>The next quotation is more comprehensive and reflects more plainly the current of thought prevalent in Shakespeare’s day, albeit here again the word “eclipse” will be found to stand without much definite connection with what goes before. However the reader shall judge for himself:— </p><p>In King Lear we seem to come upon something very definitely historical, but I am not able to say what it is. The Earl of Gloster says:— </p><p>With this, Edmund, Gloster’s son, apparently agrees, for he exclaims:— </p><p>In Othello, the Moor of Venice himself, in a moment of excitement, says:— </p><p>In Anthony and Cleopatra we find Anthony expressing what our forefathers so often thought in connection with astronomical matters:— </p><p>Milton has an allusion to an eclipse of the Sun which possesses a two-fold interest—intrinsic and extrinsic. The former feature will be self-evident when the passage is read. The poet, in describing [166] the faded splendour of the fallen archangel, compares him to the Sun seen under circumstances which have temporarily deprived it of its normal brilliancy and glory:— </p><p>It has been well said by Dr. Orchard[167] that “this passage affords us an example of the sublimity of Milton’s imagination and of his skill in adapting the grandest phenomena of nature to the illustration of his subject.”</p><p>What I alluded to in saying that extrinsic interest attached to this quotation, is the fact that these lines might have caused the suppression of the poem as a whole. Mrs. Todd puts the matter thus: <br>—“Paradise Lost was begun probably in 1658, although not finished until 1663, nor its thorough revision completed until 1665. The censorship still existed, and Tomkyns (one of the chaplains through whom the Archbishop gave or refused license), although a broader-minded man than many of his day, found this passage especially objectionable. The poem was allowed to see the light only through the interposition of a friend of Milton. Upon such slender chances may hang the life of an incomparable work of art! But it is easy to see that in the turbulent days when Charles the Second had returned to power, after the death of Cromwell, these lines should have been deemed dangerously suggestive, in imputing to monarchs ‘perplexity’ and ‘fear of change.’”</p><p>Other allusions to eclipses by Milton will be found as follows:— </p><p>Pope, in the following lines, may be presumed to mean that the covering up of the Sun by the Moon, during a total eclipse, results in the Moon becoming visible, at the cost of the Sun’s disappearance:— </p><p>I have not attempted to pursue this matter through the pages of our modern poets, but it is not unlikely that Scott and Tennyson (especially) would have something on the subject of eclipses.</p><p> </p><p>___________________ </p><p>Footnotes: </p><p>[166] Paradise Lost, Book i., lines 594-9. <br>[167] The Astronomy of Milton, p. 259.</p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

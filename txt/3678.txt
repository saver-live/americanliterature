<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wain upon the northern steep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descends and lifts away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I will sit me down and weep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For bones in Africa.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pay and medals, name and rank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things that he has not found,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hove the Cross to heaven and sank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pole-star underground.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he does not even see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signs of the nadir roll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night over the ground where he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is buried with the pole.

How clear she shines! How quietly
     I lie beneath her guardian light;
     While heaven and earth are whispering me,
     "To morrow, wake, but dream to-night."
     Yes, Fancy, come, my Fairy love!
     These throbbing temples softly kiss;
     And bend my lonely couch above,
     And bring me rest, and bring me bliss.

     The world is going; dark world, adieu!
     Grim world, conceal thee till the day;
     The heart thou canst not all subdue
     Must still resist, if thou delay!

     Thy love I will not, will not share;
     Thy hatred only wakes a smile;
     Thy griefs may woundâ€”thy wrongs may tear,
     But, oh, thy lies shall ne'er beguile!
     While gazing on the stars that glow
     Above me, in that stormless sea,
     I long to hope that all the woe
     Creation knows, is held in thee!

     And this shall be my dream to-night;
     I'll think the heaven of glorious spheres
     Is rolling on its course of light
     In endless bliss, through endless years;
     I'll think, there's not one world above,
     Far as these straining eyes can see,
     Where Wisdom ever laughed at Love,
     Or Virtue crouched to Infamy;

     Where, writhing 'neath the strokes of Fate,
     The mangled wretch was forced to smile;
     To match his patience 'gainst her hate,
     His heart rebellious all the while.
     Where Pleasure still will lead to wrong,
     And helpless Reason warn in vain;
     And Truth is weak, and Treachery strong;
     And Joy the surest path to Pain;
     And Peace, the lethargy of Grief;
     And Hope, a phantom of the soul;
     And life, a labour, void and brief;
     And Death, the despot of the whole!

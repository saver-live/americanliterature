<p><cite class="al-title">Puritanism As a Literary Force</cite> is a fascinating analysis, excerpted from Mencken's book, <cite class="al-title">A Book of Prefaces</cite>, originally published in 1917, fourth edition (1922). <i>"The thing I always have to decide about a manuscript offered for publication, before ever I give any thought to its artistic merit and suitability, is the question whether its publication will be permittedâ€”not even whether it is intrinsically good or evil, moral or immoral, but whether some roving Methodist preacher, self-commissioned to keep watch on letters, will read indecency into it."</i></p><p><i>Photo of Anthony Comstock, referenced by Mencken, represents the New Puritanism; he was Special Agent for the Post Office and the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. Also, the frontispiece from his book, <cite class="al-title">Fraud Exposed</cite> (1880).</i></p><p>You also might enjoy reading our <a href="/dark-romanticism-study-guide">Dark Romanticism Study Guide</a></p><p><a href="chapter-1">Chapter 1</a></p><p><a href="chapter-2">Chapter 2</a></p><p><a href="chapter-3">Chapter 3</a></p><p><a href="chapter-4">Chapter 4</a></p><p><a href="chapter-5">Chapter 5</a></p><p><a href="chapter-6">Chapter 6</a></p><p><a href="footnotes">Footnotes</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/hl-mencken">H.L.

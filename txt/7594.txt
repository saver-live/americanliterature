<p> I only said, "When in the evening the round full moon gets entangled among the branches of that Kadam tree, couldn't somebody catch it?"<br> But dâdâ [elder brother] laughed at me and said, "Baby, you are the silliest child I have ever known. The moon is ever so far from us, how could anybody catch it?"<br> I said, "Dâdâ how foolish you are! When mother looks out of her window and smiles down at us playing, would you call her far away?"<br> Still said, "You are a stupid child! But, baby, where could you find a net big enough to catch the moon with?"<br> I said, "Surely you could catch it with your hands."<br> But dâdâ laughed and said, "You are the silliest child I have known. If it came nearer, you would see how big the moon is."<br> I said, "Dâdâ, what nonsense they teach at your school! When mother bends her face down to kiss us does her face look very big?"<br> But still dâdâ says, "You are a stupid child."</p>

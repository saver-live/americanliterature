<p>I was about to sail away in a junk,<br> When suddenly I heard<br> The sound of stamping and singing on the bankâ<br> It was you and your friends come to bid me farewell.<br> The Peach Flower Lake is a thousand fathoms deep,<br> But it cannot compare, O Wang Lun,<br> With the depth of your love for me. <br></p>

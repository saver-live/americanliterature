<p>Oh, there's no reason for sighs,<br> Sadness is pointless, a crime,<br> Here, from grey canvas, I rise,<br> Vaguely, strangely through time.<br> <br> Arms lifted, freely curtailed,<br> A tormented smile on my face,<br> I was forced to become like this<br> Through hours of mutual grace.<br> <br> He wished it so, he willed it so,<br> With words, spiteful and dead.<br> Anxiety clotted my mouth: oh,<br> My cheeks with snow were wed.<br> <br> It's no sin of his, it seems,<br> Other eyes, he left to see,<br> No matter these empty dreams<br> Of my mortal lethargy.<br></p>

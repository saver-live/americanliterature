<p> Say of him what you please, but I know my child's failings.<br> I do not love him because he is good, but because he is my little child.<br> How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh his merits against his faults?<br> When I must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my being.<br> When I cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him.<br> I alone have a right to blame and punish, for he only may chastise who loves.</p>

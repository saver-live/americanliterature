<pre>Golden-hair’d Ally whose name is one with mine,
Crazy with laughter and babble and earth’s new wine,
Now that the flower of a year and a half is thine,
O little blossom, O mine, and mine of mine,
Glorious poet who never hast written a line,
Laugh, for the name at the head of my verse is thine.
May’st thou never be wrong’d by the name that is mine!

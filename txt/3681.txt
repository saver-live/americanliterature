&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, in the day when heaven was falling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour when earth's foundations fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed their mercenary calling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took their wages and are dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shoulders held the sky suspended;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood, and earth's foundations stay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What God abandoned, these defended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saved the sum of things for pay.

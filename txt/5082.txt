&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nimrud, ah, Nimrud!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God prepares an ill day far Nimrud!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the shadow of the border-peels, now, now, now!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rocks of the passes where the expectant shoe their horses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They beat (among the rifles and the riders)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nimrud, ah, Nimrud!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide away the rifles and let down the ladders from the watch-towers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They beat (among all the peoples)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, now, now!

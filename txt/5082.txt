<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weve rode and fought and ate and drunk as rations* come to hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together for a year and more around this stinkin land:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you are goin home again, but we must see it through.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We neednt tell we liked you well. Good-bye, good luck to you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ad no special call to come, and so you doubled out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learned us how to camp and cook an steal a horse and scout.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever game we fancied most, you joyful played it too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rather better on the whole. Good-bye, good luck to you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There isnt much we ave nt shared, since Kruger cut and run,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same old work the same old skoff the same old dust and sun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same old chance that laid us out, or winked an let us through;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same old Life, the same old Death. Good-bye, good luck to you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our blood as truly mixed with yours, all down the Red Cross train.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weve bit the same thermometer in Bloeming-typhoidtein.**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weve ad the same old temprature, the same relapses too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same old saw-backed fever-chart. Good-bye, good luck to you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But twasnt merely this an that (which all the world may know),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twas how you talked an looked at things which made us like you so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All independent, queer an odd, but most amazin new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My word! you shook us up to rights. Good-bye, good luck to you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think o the stories round the fire, the tales along the trek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Calgary an Wellinton, an Sydney and Quebec;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mine an farm, an ranch an run, an moose an cariboo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An parrots peckin lambs to death! Good-bye, good luck to you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weve seen your ome by word o mouth, weve watched your rivers shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weve eard your bloomin forests blow of eucalip and pine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your young, gay countries north and south, we feel we own em too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they was made by rank an file. Good-bye, good luck to you,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well never read the papers now without inquirin first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For word from all those friendly dorps where you was born an nursed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Dawson, Galle, an Montreal, Port Darwin, Timaru,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theyre only just across the road! Good-bye, good luck to you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good-bye!, So, long! Dont lose yourselves, nor us, nor all kind friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tell the girls your side the drift were comin, when it ends!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good-bye, you bloomin Atlases! Youve taught us somethin new:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worlds no bigger than a kraal. Good-bye, good luck to you!

<p>Amongst the flowers I<br> am alone with my pot of wine<br> drinking by myself; then lifting<br> my cup I asked the moon<br> to drink with me, its reflection<br> and mine in the wine cup, just<br> the three of us; then I sigh<br> for the moon cannot drink,<br> and my shadow goes emptily along<br> with me never saying a word;<br> with no other friends here, I can<br> but use these two for company;<br> <br> in the time of happiness, I<br> too must be happy with all<br> around me; I sit and sing<br> and it is as if the moon<br> accompanies me; then if I<br> dance, it is my shadow that<br> dances along with me; while<br> still not drunk, I am glad<br> to make the moon and my shadow<br> into friends, but then when<br> I have drunk too much, we<br> all part; yet these are<br> friends I can always count on<br> these who have no emotion<br> whatsoever; I hope that one day<br> we three will meet again,<br> deep in the Milky Way.<br> <br> Version 2<br> Beneath the blossoms with a pot of wine,<br> No friends at hand, so I poured alone;<br> I raised my cup to invite the moon,<br> Turned to my shadow, and we became three.<br> Now the moon had never learned about drinking,<br> And my shadow had merely followed my form,<br> But I quickly made friends with the moon and my shadow;<br> To find pleasure in life, make the most of the spring.<br> <br> Whenever I sang, the moon swayed with me;<br> Whenever I danced, my shadow went wild.<br> Drinking, we shared our enjoyment together;<br> Drunk, then each went off on his own.<br> But forever agreed on dispassionate revels,<br> We promised to meet in the far Milky Way. <br></p>

<p>For O. A. Kuzmin-Karavaev<br> <br> 'If we can only reach the shore,<br> My dear!' – 'Silently…'<br> And so we slipped down the stair,<br> Not breathing, searching for keys.<br> <br> Past the place where we once<br> Danced, and drank the wine,<br> Past the Senate's white columns,<br> To where it was dark as a mine.<br> <br> 'What are you doing, you're crazy!' –<br> 'No, just in love with you!<br> This breeze – wide and windy,<br> Will delight a boat or two!'<br> <br> Throat constrained with horror,<br> The skiff carried us in darkness…<br> A sea-cable's strong odour<br> Scorched my quivering nostrils.<br> <br> 'Tell me, you surely must know:<br> Am I sleeping? So like a dream…'<br> Only the oars measured blows,<br> On the Neva's heavy stream.<br> <br> But the black sky lightened,<br> Someone called from a bridge,<br> With both hands I grasped<br> The cross's chain at my breast.<br> <br> Powerless, I was lifted, like<br> A young girl, in your arms,<br> Onto the white yacht's deck,<br> To meet day's incorruptible charms. 60<br> 'I rarely think of you now'<br> Irarely think of you now,<br> Not captured by your fate,<br> But our insignificant meeting's trace<br> Has not vanished from my soul.<br> <br> I purposely avoid your red house,<br> That red house on its muddy river,<br> But I know I bitterly disturb<br> Your sunlit heart at rest.<br> <br> Though you never bent to my lips,<br> Imploring love,<br> Never immortalised my longing<br> In verse of gold –<br> <br> Isecretly conjure the future,<br> When evening shines clear and blue,<br> And foresee the inevitable meeting,<br> A second meeting, with you.<br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed be this place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More blessed still this tower;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody, arrogant power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose out of the race
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttering, mastering it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose like these walls from these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storm-beaten cottages
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mockery I have set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A powerful emblem up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing it rhyme upon rhyme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mockery of a time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half dead at the top.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexandria's was a beacon tower, and Babylon's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An image of the moving heavens, a log-book of the sun's journey and the moon's;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Shelley had his towers, thought's crowned powers he called them once.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I declare this tower is my symbol; I declare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This winding, gyring, spiring treadmill of a stair is my ancestral stair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Goldsmith and the Dean, Berkeley and Burke have travelled there.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift beating on his breast in sibylline frenzy blind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the heart in his blood-sodden breast had dragged him down into mankind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldsmith deliberately sipping at the honey-pot of his mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And haughtier-headed Burke that proved the State a tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this unconquerable labyrinth of the birds, century after century,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast but dead leaves to mathematical equality;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God-appointed Berkeley that proved all things a dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this pragmatical, preposterous pig of a world, its farrow that so solid seem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must vanish on the instant if the mind but change its theme;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I(Saeva Indignatio) and the labourer's hire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength that gives our blood and state magnanimity of its own desire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that is not God consumed with intellectual fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purity of the unclouded moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has flung its atrowy shaft upon the floor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven centuries have passed and it is pure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of innocence has left no stain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, on blood-saturated ground, have stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldier, assassin, executioner.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether for daily pittance or in blind fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or out of abstract hatred, and shed blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But could not cast a single jet thereon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odour of blood on the ancestral stair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we that have shed none must gather there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clamour in drunken frenzy for the moon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the dusty, glittering windows cling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seem to cling upon the moonlit skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tortoiseshell butterflies, peacock butterflies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of night-moths are on the wing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is every modern nation like the tower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half dead at the top? No matter what I said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wisdom is the property of the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A something incompatible with life; and power,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like everything that has the stain of blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A property of the living; but no stain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can come upon the visage of the moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it has looked in glory from a cloud.

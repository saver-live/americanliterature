WHEN I woke, the lake-lights were quivering on the
     wall,
The sunshine swam in a shoal across and across,
And a hairy, big bee hung over the primulas
In the window, his body black fur, and the sound
     of him cross.
There was something I ought to remember: and yet 
I did not remember. Why should I? The running lights 
And the airy primulas, oblivious Of the impending beeâ€”
they were fair enough sights.

<p>Ice, resonant, floats by,<br> The sky is hopelessly pale,<br> Oh, why do you punish me?<br> What crime am I guilty of?<br> <br> If you wish â€“ then murder me,<br> But don't be so harsh with me.<br> With me you don't want children,<br> And you don't like my poetry.<br> <br> As you would have it, let it be!<br> True to my vow, I give my life<br> To you. But my sadness<br> I'll take to the grave with me.<br></p>

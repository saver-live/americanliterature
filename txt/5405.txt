Thank God that there are solid folk
     Who water flowers and roll the lawn,
     And sit an sew and talk and smoke,
     And snore all through the summer dawn.

     Who pass untroubled nights and days
     Full-fed and sleepily content,
     Rejoicing in each other's praise,
     Respectable and innocent.

     Who feel the things that all men feel,
     And think in well-worn grooves of thought,
     Whose honest spirits never reel
     Before man's mystery, overwrought.

     Yet not unfaithful nor unkind,
     with work-day virtues surely staid,
     Theirs is the sane and humble mind,
     And dull affections undismayed.

     O happy people! I have seen
     No verse yet written in your praise,
     And, truth to tell, the time has been
     I would have scorned your easy ways.

     But now thro' weariness and strife
     I learn your worthiness indeed,
     The world is better for such life
     As stout suburban people lead.

     Too often have I sat alone
     When the wet night falls heavily,
     And fretting winds around me moan,
     And homeless longing vexes me

     For lore that I shall never know,
     And visions none can hope to see,
     Till brooding works upon me so
     A childish fear steals over me.

     I look around the empty room,
     The clock still ticking in its place,
     And all else silent as the tomb,
     Till suddenly, I think, a face

     Grows from the darkness just beside.
     I turn, and lo! it fades away,
     And soon another phantom tide
     Of shifting dreams begins to play,

     And dusky galleys past me sail,
     Full freighted on a faerie sea;
     I hear the silken merchants hail
     Across the ringing waves to me

     —Then suddenly, again, the room,
     Familiar books about me piled,
     And I alone amid the gloom,
     By one more mocking dream beguiled.

     And still no neared to the Light,
     And still no further from myself,
     Alone and lost in clinging night—
     (The clock's still ticking on the shelf).

     Then do I envy solid folk
     Who sit of evenings by the fire,
     After their work and doze and smoke,
     And are not fretted by desire.

<p>On Soochow's terrace the crows find their nests.<br> The King of Wu in his palace drinks with Hsi Shih.<br> Songs of Wu, Dances of Chu quicken their pleasure<br> One half of the sun is caught in the valley's throat.<br> <br> The clock's silver arrow marks the passing hours.<br> They rise early to see the autumn moon,<br> Watch it sink down into deep river.<br> Daylight glows in the East. Dawn renews their joy. <br></p>

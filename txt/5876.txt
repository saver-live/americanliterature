&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Mountains of the Prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the Master of Life, descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the red crags of the quarry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood erect, and called the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called the tribes of men together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his footprints flowed a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped into the light of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the precipice plunging downward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Spirit, stooping earthward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his finger on the meadow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traced a winding pathway for it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying to it, "Run in this way!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the red stone of the quarry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hand he broke a fragment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moulded it into a pipe-head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaped and fashioned it with figures;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the margin of the river
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took a long reed for a pipe-stem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its dark green leaves upon it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the pipe with bark of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bark of the red willow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed upon the neighboring forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made its great boughs chafe together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in flame they burst and kindled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And erect upon the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoked the calumet, the Peace-Pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a signal to the nations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the smoke rose slowly, slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the tranquil air of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a single line of darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a denser, bluer vapor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a snow-white cloud unfolding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the tree-tops of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever rising, rising, rising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it touched the top of heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it broke against the heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rolled outward all around it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Vale of Tawasentha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Valley of Wyoming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the groves of Tuscaloosa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the far-off Rocky Mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Northern lakes and rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the tribes beheld the signal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the distant smoke ascending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Prophets of the nations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said: "Behold it, the Pukwana!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending like a wand of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waving like a hand that beckons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls the tribes of men together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls the warriors to his council!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the rivers, o'er the prairies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the warriors of the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Delawares and Mohawks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Choctaws and Camanches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Shoshonies and Blackfeet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Pawnees and Omahas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Mandans and Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Hurons and Ojibways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the warriors drawn together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the signal of the Peace-Pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Mountains of the Prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they stood there on the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their weapons and their war-gear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted like the leaves of Autumn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted like the sky of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildly glaring at each other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their faces stern defiance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their hearts the feuds of ages,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hereditary hatred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancestral thirst of vengeance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creator of the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked upon them with compassion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With paternal love and pity;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked upon their wrath and wrangling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as quarrels among children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as feuds and fights of children!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them he stretched his right hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To subdue their stubborn natures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allay their thirst and fever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shadow of his right hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake to them with voice majestic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sound of far-off waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling into deep abysses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning, chiding, spake in this wise:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O my children! my poor children!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the words of wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the words of warning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lips of the Great Spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Master of Life, who made you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have given you lands to hunt in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given you streams to fish in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given you bear and bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given you roe and reindeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given you brant and beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the marshes full of wild-fowl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the rivers full of fishes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then are you not contented?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then will you hunt each other?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am weary of your quarrels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary of your wars and bloodshed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary of your prayers for vengeance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your wranglings and dissensions;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your strength is in your union,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your danger is in discord;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore be at peace henceforward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as brothers live together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will send a Prophet to you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Deliverer of the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall guide you and shall teach you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall toil and suffer with you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you listen to his counsels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will multiply and prosper;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his warnings pass unheeded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will fade away and perish!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bathe now in the stream before you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash the war-paint from your faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash the blood-stains from your fingers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bury your war-clubs and your weapons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break the red stone from this quarry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the reeds that grow beside you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deck them with your brightest feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke the calumet together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as brothers live henceforward!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then upon the ground the warriors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw their cloaks and shirts of deer-skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw their weapons and their war-gear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped into the rushing river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washed the war-paint from their faces.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear above them flowed the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear and limpid from the footprints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Master of Life descending;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark below them flowed the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if blood were mingled with it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the river came the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean and washed from all their war-paint;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the banks their clubs they buried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried all their warlike weapons.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitche Manito, the mighty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Spirit, the creator,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled upon his helpless children!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in silence all the warriors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the red stone of the quarry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoothed and formed it into Peace-Pipes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the long reeds by the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decked them with their brightest feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And departed each one homeward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Master of Life, ascending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the opening of cloud-curtains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the doorways of the heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished from before their faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smoke that rolled around him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pukwana of the Peace-Pipe!

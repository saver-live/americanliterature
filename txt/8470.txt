<p>DIED AUGUST 18, 1896; AGED 24 </p><p>In a fair valley--oh, how long ago, how long ago!--<br> Where all the broad expanse was clothed in vines,<br> And fruitful fields and meadows starred with flowers,<br> And clear streams wandered at their idle will;<br> And still lakes slept, their burnished surfaces<br> A dream of painted clouds, and soft airs<br> Went whispering with odorous breath,<br> And all was peace--in that fair vale,<br> Shut from the troubled world, a nameless hamlet drowsed.<br> </p><p>Hard by, apart, a temple stood;<br> And strangers from the outer world<br> Passing, noted it with tired eyes,<br> And seeing, saw it not:<br> A glimpse of its fair form--an answering momentary thrill--<br> And they passed on, careless and unaware. </p><p>They could not know the cunning of its make;<br> They could not know the secret shut up in its heart;<br> Only the dwellers of the hamlet knew;<br> They knew that what seemed brass was gold;<br> What marble seemed, was ivory;<br> The glories that enriched the milky surfaces--<br> The trailing vines, and interwoven flowers,<br> And tropic birds a-wing, clothed all in tinted fires--<br> They knew for what they were, not what they seemed:<br> Encrustings all of gems, not perishable splendours of the brush.<br> They knew the secret spot where one must stand--<br> They knew the surest hour, the proper slant of sun--<br> To gather in, unmarred, undimmed,<br> The vision of the fane in all its fairy grace,<br> A fainting dream against the opal sky. </p><p>And more than this. They knew<br> That in the temple's inmost place a spirit dwelt,<br> Made all of light!<br> For glimpses of it they had caught<br> Beyond the curtains when the priests<br> That served the altar came and went. </p><p>All loved that light and held it dear<br> That had this partial grace;<br> But the adoring priests alone who lived<br> By day and night submerged in its immortal glow<br> Knew all its power and depth, and could appraise the loss<br> If it should fade and fail and come no more. </p><p>All this was long ago--so long ago! </p><p>The light burned on; and they that worshipped it,<br> And they that caught its flash at intervals and held it dear,<br> Contented lived in its secure possession. Ah,<br> How long ago it was! </p><p>And then when they<br> Were nothing fearing, and God's peace was in the air,<br> And none was prophesying harm,<br> The vast disaster fell:<br> Where stood the temple when the sun went down<br> Was vacant desert when it rose again! </p><p>Ah yes! 'Tis ages since it chanced!<br> So long ago it was,<br> That from the memory of the hamlet-folk the Light has passed--<br> They scarce believing, now, that once it was,<br> Or if believing, yet not missing it,<br> And reconciled to have it gone. </p><p>Not so the priests! Oh, not so<br> The stricken ones that served it day and night,<br> Adoring it, abiding in the healing of its peace:<br> They stand, yet, where erst they stood<br> Speechless in that dim morning long ago;<br> And still they gaze, as then they gazed,<br> And murmur, 'It will come again;<br> It knows our pain--it knows--it knows--<br> Ah surely it will come again. </p><p>S.L.C. </p><p>LAKE LUCERNE, August 18, 1897. </p><p>&nbsp; </p><p></p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

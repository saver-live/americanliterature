<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nation spoke to a Nation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Queen sent word to a Throne:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter am I in my mothers house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mistress in my own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates are mine to open,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the gates are mine to close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I set my house in order,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said our Lady of the Snows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither with laughter nor weeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear or the childs amaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soberly under the White Mans law
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My white men go their ways.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for the Gentiles clamour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insult or threat of blows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow we the knee to Baal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said our Lady of the Snows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My speech is clean and single,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talk of common things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words of the wharf and the market-place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ware the merchant brings:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Favour to those I favour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a stumbling-block to my foes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many there be that hate us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said our Lady of the Snows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I called my chiefs to council
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the din of a troubled year;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of a sign ye would not see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a word ye would not hear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our message and answer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the path we chose:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we be also a people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said our Lady of the Snows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carry the word to my sisters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Queens of the East and the South.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have proven faith in the Heritage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By more than the word of the mouth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They that are wise may follow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the worlds war-trumpet blows,,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I, I am first in the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said our Lady of the Snows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Nation spoke to a Nation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Throne sent word to a Throne:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter am I in my mothers house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mistress in my own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates are mine to open,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the gates are mine to close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I abide by my Mothers House,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said our Lady of the Snows.

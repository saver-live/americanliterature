I would rather be ashes than dust!
I would rather that my spark
should burn out in a brilliant blaze
than it should be stifled by dry-rot.

I would rather be a superb meteor
every atom of me in magnificent glow
than a sleepy and permanent planet. 

The function of man is to live
not to exist. 
I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. 
I shall use my time.

<p>Let love go, if go she will.<br> Seek not, O fool, her wanton flight to stay.<br> Of all she gives and takes away<br> The best remains behind her still.<br> <br> The best remains behind; in vain<br> Joy she may give and take again,<br> Joy she may take and leave us pain,<br> If yet she leave behind<br> The constant mind<br> To meet all fortunes nobly, to endure<br> All things with a good heart, and still be pure,<br> Still to be foremost in the foremost cause,<br> And still be worthy of the love that was.<br> Love coming is omnipotent indeed,<br> But not Love going. Let her go. The seed<br> Springs in the favouring Summer air, and grows,<br> And waxes strong; and when the Summer goes,<br> Remains, a perfect tree.<br> <br> Joy she may give and take again,<br> Joy she may take and leave us pain.<br> O Love, and what care we?<br> For one thing thou hast given, O Love, one thing<br> Is ours that nothing can remove;<br> And as the King discrowned is still a King,<br> The unhappy lover still preserves his love.<br> </p>

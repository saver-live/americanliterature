&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> "Oh, sick I am to see you, will you never let me be?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be good for something, but you are not good for me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, go where you are wanted, for you are not wanted here." </i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was all the farewell when I parted from my dear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go where I am wanted, to a lady born and bred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will not be sick to see me if I only keep it clean:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go where I am wanted for a soldier of the Queen."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go where I am wanted, for the sergeant does not mind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may be sick to see me but he treats me very kind:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go where I am wanted, where there's room for one or two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the men are none too many for the work there is to do;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the enemies of England they shall see me and be sick."

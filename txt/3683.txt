<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lads were home from labour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Abdon under Clee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man would call his neighbor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both would send for me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where the light in lances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the mead was laid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There to the dances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fetched my flute and played.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours were idle pleasures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet oh, content we were,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young to wind the measures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old to heed the air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I to lift with playing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From tree and tower and steep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light delaying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flute the sun to sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth toward his fancy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would turn his brow of tan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tom would pair with Nancy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dick step off with Fan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl would lift her glances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his, and both be mute:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well went the dances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At evening to the flute.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenlock Edge was umbered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bright was Abdon Burf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And warm between them slumbered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smooth green miles of turf;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until from grass and clover
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upshot beam would fade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And England over
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced the lofty shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lofty shade advances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fetch my flute and play:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, lads, and learn the dances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And praise the tune to-day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow, moreÂ’s the pity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away we both must hie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To air the ditty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to earth I.

<p>When the beautiful woman was here, the hall was filled with flowers,<br> Now the beautiful woman's gone, the bed is lying empty.<br> On the bed, the embroidered quilt is rolled up: no-one sleeps,<br> Though three years have now gone by, I think I smell that scent.<br> The scent is finished but not destroyed,<br> The woman's gone and does not come.<br> Yearning yellows the falling leaf,<br> White dew beads the green moss. <br></p>

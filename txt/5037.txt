<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, with a pain he desires to explain to the multitude, Baby
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howls himself black in the face, toothlessly striving to curse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the six-months-old Mother begins to enquire of the Gods if it may be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tummy, or Temper, or Pins, what does the adequate Nurse?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See! At one turn of her head the trouble is guessed; and, thereafter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She juggles (unscared by his throes) with drops of hot water and spoons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the hiccoughs are broken by smiles, and the smiles pucker up into laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he lies oer her shoulder and crows, and she, as she nurses him, croons!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, at the head of the grade, tumultuous out of the cutting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pours the belated Express, roars at the night, and draws dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redly obscured or displayed by her fire-doors opening and shutting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbol of strength under stress, what does her small engineer?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clamour and darkness encircle his way. Do they deafen or blind him?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No!, nor the pace he must keep. He, being used to these things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placidly follows his work, which is laying his mileage behind him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his passengers trustfully sleep, and he, as he handles her, sings!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, with the gale at her heel, the barque lies down and recovers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolling through forty degrees, combing the stars with her tops,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What says the man at the wheel, holding her straight as she hovers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the summits of wind-screening seas, steadying her as she drops?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him the blasts without check from the Pole to the Tropic, pursue him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaving up, heaping high, slamming home, the surges he must not regard:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath him the crazy wet deck, and all Ocean on end to undo him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above him one desperate sail, thrice-reefed but still buckling the yard!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his hand fleet the spokes and return, to be held or set free again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she bows and makes shift to obey their behest, till the master-wave comes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her gunnel goes under in thunder and smokes, and she chokes in the trough of the sea again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere she can lift and make way to its crest; and he, as he nurses her, hums!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These have so utterly mastered their work that they work without thinking;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding three-fifths of their brain in reserve for whatever betide.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when catastrophe threatens, of colic, collision or sinking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shunt the full gear into train, and take the small thing in their stride.

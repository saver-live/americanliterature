<pre>One grief on me is laid
 Each day of every year,
Wherein no soul can aid,
 Whereof no soul can hear:
Whereto no end is seen
 Except to grieve again,
Ah, Mary Magdalene,
 Where is there greater pain?

To dream on dear disgrace
 Each hour of every day,
To bring no honest face
 To aught I do or say:
To lie from morn till e'en,
 To know my lies are vain,
Ah, Mary Magdalene,
 Where can be greater pain?

To watch my steadfast fear
 Attend mine every way
Each day of every year,
 Each hour of every day:
To burn, and chill between,
 To quake and rage again,
Ah, Mary Magdalene,
 Where shall be greater pain:

One grave to me was given,
 To guard till Judgment Day,
But God looked down from Heaven
 And rolled the Stone away!
One day of all my years,
 One hour of that one day,
His Angel saw my tears
 And rolled the Stone away!

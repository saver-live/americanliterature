<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town, the churchyard, and the setting sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds, the trees, the rounded hills all seem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though beautiful, cold, strange, as in a dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamed long ago, now new begun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-liv'd, paly summer is but won
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From winter's ague for one hour's gleam;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sapphire warm their stars do never beam:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is cold Beauty; pain is never done.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For who has mind to relish, Minos-wise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real of Beauty, free from that dead hue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sickly imagination and sick pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast wan upon it? Burns! with honour due
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I oft have honour'd thee. Great shadow, hide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy face; I sin against thy native skies.

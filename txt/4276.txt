<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In after-time, a sage of mickle lore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yclep'd Typographus, the Giant took,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did refit his limbs as heretofore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made him read in many a learned book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into many a lively legend look;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereby in goodly themes so training him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all his brutishness he quite forsook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, meeting Artegall and Talus grim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one he struck stone-blind, the other's eyes wox dim.

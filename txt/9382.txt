<pre>Cumhal called out, bending his head,
Till Dathi came and stood,
With a blink in his eyes at the cave mouth,
Between the wind and the wood.

And Cumhal said, bending his knees,
I have come by the windy way
To gather the half of your blessedness
And learn to pray when you pray.

I can bring you salmon out of the streams
And heron out of the skies.
But Dathi folded his hands and smiled
With the secrets of God in his eyes.

And Cumhal saw like a drifting smoke
All manner of blessed souls,
Women and children, young men with books,
And old men with croziers and stoles.

Praise God and Gods mother, Dathi said,
For God and Gods mother have sent
The blessedest souls that walk in the world
To fill your heart with content.

And which is the blessedest, Cumhal said,
Where all are comely and good?
Is it these that with golden thuribles
Are singing about the wood?

My eyes are blinking, Dathi said,
With the secrets of God half blind,
But I can see where the wind goes
And follow the way of the wind;

And blessedness goes where the wind goes,
And when it is gone we are dead;
I see the blessedest soul in the world
And he nods a drunken head.

O blessedness comes in the night and the day
And whither the wise heart knows;
And one has seen in the redness of wine
The Incorruptible Rose,

That drowsily drops faint leaves on him
And the sweetness of desire,
While time and the world are ebbing away
In twilights of dew and of fire.

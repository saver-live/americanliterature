<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a charm in footing slow across a silent plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where patriot battle has been fought, where glory had the gain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pleasure on the heath where Druids old have been,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where mantles grey have rustled by and swept the nettles green;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a joy in every spot made known by times of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New to the feet, although each tale a hundred times be told;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deeper joy than all, more solemn in the heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More parching to the tongue than all, of more divine a smart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When weary steps forget themselves upon a pleasant turf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hot sand, or flinty road, or sea-shore iron scurf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the castle or the cot, where long ago was born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One who was great through mortal days, and died of fame unshorn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light heather-bells may tremble then, but they are far away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood-lark may sing from sandy fern, the Sun may hear this lay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runnels may kiss the grass on shelves and shallows clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their low voices are not heard, though come on travels drear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood-red the Sun may set behind the black mountain peaks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue tides may sluice and drench their time in caves and weedy creeks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagles may seem to sleep wing-side upon the air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring-dove may fly convuls'd across to some high-cedar'd lair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the forgotten eye is still fast lidded to the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Palmer's, that with weariness, mid-desert shrine hath found.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At such a time the soul's a child, in childhood is the brain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgotten is the worldly heart alone, it beats in vain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, if a madman could have leave to pass a healthful day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell his forehead's swoon and faint when first began decay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might make tremble many a one whose spirit had gone forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find a Bard's low cradle-place about the silent North!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanty the hour and few the steps, because a longer stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would bar return, and make a man forget his mortal way:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O horrible! to lose the sight of well remember'd face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Brother's eyes, of Sister's brow constant to every place;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the air, as on we move, with portraiture intense;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More warm than those heroic tints that pain a painter's sense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shapes of old come striding by, and visages of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locks shining black, hair scanty grey, and passions manifold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, that horror cannot be, for at the cable's length
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man feels the gentle anchor pull and gladdens in its strength:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour, half-idiot, he stands by mossy waterfall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the very next he reads his soul's memorial:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reads it on the mountain's height, where chance he may sit down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon rough marble diadem that hill's eternal crown.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet be his anchor e'er so fast, room is there for a prayer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That man may never lose his mind on mountains black and bare;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he may stray league after league some great birth-place to find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep his vision clear from speck, his inward sight unblind.

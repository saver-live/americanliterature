<p>Now no one will listen to my songs.<br> The prophesied days have come to pass.<br> Last poem of mine, earth has lost its magic.<br> Don't break my heart, don't resound.<br> <br> Not long ago, free as a swallow,<br> You accomplished your morning flight.<br> Now you've become a starving beggar,<br> Don't go knocking at the stranger's door.<br></p>

<p><cite class="al-title">The Hairy Ape</cite> (1922) is O'Neill's expressionist play with the lead character an antagonist named Yank. He's a brutish, unthinking laborer who has to find his place in the world controlled by the rich. O'Neill offers a dramatic portrayal of a regular man who gets beaten down by industrialization and an oppressive social class. Pictured is O'Neill's future wife, Carlotta Monterey, starring in a production at the Plymouth Theater (1922).</p><p><a href="characters">Characters</a></p><p><a href="scene-i">Scene I</a></p><p><a href="scene-ii">Scene II</a></p><p><a href="scene-iii">Scene III</a></p><p><a href="scene-iv">Scene IV</a></p><p><a href="scene-v">Scene V</a></p><p><a href="scene-vi">Scene VI</a></p><p><a href="scene-vii">Scene VII</a></p><p><a href="scene-viii">Scene VIII</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/eugene-oneill">Eugene O'Neill</a> library. </p>

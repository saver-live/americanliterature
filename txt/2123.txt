<p>COME live with me, and be my love,<br> And we will some new pleasures prove<br> Of golden sands, and crystal brooks,<br> With silken lines and silver hooks.<br> <br> There will the river whisp'ring run<br> Warm'd by thy eyes, more than the sun;<br> And there th' enamour'd fish will stay,<br> Begging themselves they may betray.<br> <br> When thou wilt swim in that live bath,<br> Each fish, which every channel hath,<br> Will amorously to thee swim,<br> Gladder to catch thee, than thou him.<br> <br> If thou, to be so seen, be'st loth,<br> By sun or moon, thou dark'nest both,<br> And if myself have leave to see,<br> I need not their light, having thee.<br> <br> Let others freeze with angling reeds,<br> And cut their legs with shells and weeds,<br> Or treacherously poor fish beset,<br> With strangling snare, or windowy net.<br> <br> Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest<br> The bedded fish in banks out-wrest;<br> Or curious traitors, sleeve-silk flies,<br> Bewitch poor fishes' wand'ring eyes.<br> <br> For thee, thou need'st no such deceit,<br> For thou thyself art thine own bait:<br> That fish, that is not catch'd thereby,<br> Alas! is wiser far than I.</p>

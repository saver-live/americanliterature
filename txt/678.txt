<p>The living is a passing traveler;<br> The dead, a man come home.<br> One brief journey betwixt heaven and earth,<br> Then, alas! we are the same old dust of ten thousand ages.<br> The rabbit in the moon pounds the medicine in vain;<br> Fu-sang, the tree of immortality, has crumbled to kindling wood.<br> Man dies, his white bones are dumb without a word<br> When the green pines feel the coming of the spring.<br> Looking back, I sigh; looking before, I sigh again.<br> What is there to prize in the life's vaporous glory? <br></p>

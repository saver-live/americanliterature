<p>Ah! You thought I'm the kind too,<br> To cry 'how could you forget me',<br> And praying and sobbing, throw myself<br> Under the horses' hooves.<br> <br> Or that I'd ask the sorceress<br> For some enchanted root in water,<br> And send you a fatal gift –<br> My secretly-scented handkerchief.<br> <br> I'd rather be damned. Not a look or sigh<br> Will reach your accursed soul,<br> But I swear by the angelic garden,<br> I swear by the miraculous icon,<br> And by our nights of fiery passion –<br> I'll never return to you.<br></p>

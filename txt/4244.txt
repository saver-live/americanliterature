&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of the golden bow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the golden lyre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the golden hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the golden fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charioteer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the patient year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where where slept thine ire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When like a blank idiot I put on thy wreath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy laurel, thy glory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of thy story,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or was I a worm too low crawling for death?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Delphic Apollo!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thunderer grasp'd and grasp'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thunderer frown'd and frown'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle's feathery mane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wrath became stiffen'd the sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of breeding thunder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went drowsily under,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muttering to be unbound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O why didst thou pity, and beg for a worm?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why touch thy soft lute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the thunder was mute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was I not crush'd such a pitiful germ?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Delphic Apollo!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pleiades were up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the silent air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeds and roots in Earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were swelling for summer fare;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ocean, its neighbour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was at his old labour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, who who did dare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tie for a moment, thy plant round his brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grin and look proudly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blaspheme so loudly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And live for that honour, to stoop to thee now?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Delphic Apollo!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh morning gusts have blown away all fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my glad bosom, now from gloominess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mount for ever not an atom less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the proud laurel shall content my bier.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! by the eternal stars! or why sit here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Sun's eye, and 'gainst my temples press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo's very leaves, woven to bless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By thy white fingers and thy spirit clear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! who dares say, "Do this"? Who dares call down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My will from its high purpose? Who say,"Stand,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, "Go"? This mighty moment I would frown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On abject Caesars not the stoutest band
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mailed heroes should tear off my crown:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet would I kneel and kiss thy gentle hand!

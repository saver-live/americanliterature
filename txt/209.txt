<p>You are always new and mysterious,<br> I am obedient to you each day.<br> But your love, my severe one,<br> Is a trial by steel and flame.<br> <br> I'm forbidden to sing or smile,<br> Forbidden long ago to pray.<br> But nothing matters now to me<br> Except not to part from you!<br> <br> So, exiled from heaven and earth,<br> I no longer sing, yet am still alive,<br> As if you barred my errant soul,<br> From both hell and paradise.<br></p>

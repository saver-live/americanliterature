<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EQUALITY OF SACRIFICE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. I was a Have. B. I was a have-not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Together.) What hast thou given which I gave not?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A SERVANT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were together since the War began.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was my servant, and the better man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A SON

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My son was killed while laughing at some jest. I would I knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it was, and it might serve me in a time when jests are few.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AN ONLY SON

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have slain none except my Mother.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She (Blessing her slayer) died of grief for me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EX-CLERK

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pity not! The Army gave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom to a timid slave:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which Freedom did he find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength of body, will, and mind:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By which strength he came to prove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirth, Companionship, and Love:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which Love to Death he went:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which Death he lies content.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE WONDER

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body and Spirit I surrendered whole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To harsh Instructors, and received a soul . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If mortal man could change me through and through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all I was, what may The God not do?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HINDU SEPOY IN FRANCE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man in his own country prayed we know not to what Powers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray Them to reward him for his bravery in ours.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE COWARD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not look on Death, which being known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men led me to him, blindfold and alone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOCK

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name, my speech, my self I had forgot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and children came, I knew them not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I died. My Mother followed. At her call
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her bosom I remembered all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A GRAVE NEAR CAIRO

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods of the Nile, should this stout fellow here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out, get out! He knows not shame nor fear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PELICANS IN THE WILDERNESS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A Grave Near Halfa)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blown sand heaps on me, that none may learn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I am laid for whom my children grieve. . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O wings that beat at dawning, ye return
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the desert to your young at eve!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE FAVOUR

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death favoured me from the first, well knowing I could not endure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wait on him day by day. He quitted my betters and came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling over the fields, and, when he had made all sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy line is at end, he said, but at least I have saved its name.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BEGINNER

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first hour of my first day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the front trench I fell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Children in boxes at a play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand up to watch it well.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R.A.F. (AGED EIGHTEEN)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing through clouds, his milk-teeth still unshed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cities and men he smote from overhead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His deaths delivered, he returned to play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childlike, with childish things now put away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE REFINED MAN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was of delicate mind. I stepped aside for my needs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disdaining the common office. I was seen from afar and killed. . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this matter for mirth? Let each man be judged by his deeds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have paid my price to live with myself on the terms that I willed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NATIVE WATER-CARRIER (M.E.F.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prometheus brought down fire to men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brought up water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gods are jealous, now, as then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving no quarter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOMBED IN LONDON

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On land and sea I strove with anxious care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To escape conscription. It was in the air!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SLEEPY SENTINEL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faithless the watch that I kept: now I have none to keep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was slain because I slept: now I am slain I sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let no man reproach me again; whatever watch is unkept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sleep because I am slain. They slew me because I slept.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BATTERIES OUT OF AMMUNITION

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any mourn us in the workshop, say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We died because the shift kept holiday.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMON FORM

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any question why we died,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell them, because our fathers lied.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A DEAD STATESMAN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not dig: I dared not rob:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I lied to please the mob.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all my lies are proved untrue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I must face the men I slew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What tale shall serve me here among
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine angry and defrauded young?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE REBEL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had clamoured at Thy Gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For gift of Life on Earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, thrusting through the souls that wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flung headlong into birth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then, even then, for gin and snare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About my pathway spread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, I had mocked Thy thoughtful care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I joined the Dead!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now? . . . I was beneath Thy Hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere yet the Planets came.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, though Planets pass, I stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witness to Thy shame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE OBEDIENT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily, though no ears attended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did my prayers arise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily, though no fire descended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I sacrifice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though my darkness did not lift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I faced no lighter odds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Gods bestowed no gift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None the less,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None the less, I served the Gods!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A DRIFTER OFF TARENTUM

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He from the wind-bitten north with ship and companions descended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searching for eggs of death spawned by invisible hulls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many he found and drew forth. Of a sudden the fishery ended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In flame and a clamorous breath not new to the eye-pecking gulls.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DESTROYERS IN COLLISION

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fog and Fate no charm is found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lighten or amend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, hurrying to my bride, was drowned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut down by my best friend.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONVOY ESCORT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a shepherd to fools
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Causelessly bold or afraid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would not abide by my rules.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet they escaped. For I stayed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNKNOWN FEMALE CORPSE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headless, lacking foot and hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horrible I come to land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beseech all womens sons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know I was a mother once.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RAPED AND REVENGED

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One used and butchered me: another spied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me broken, for which thing an hundred died.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was learned among the heathen hosts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much a freeborn womans favour costs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SALONIKAN GRAVE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have watched a thousand days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Push out and crawl into night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly as tortoises.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I, too, follow these.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fever, and not the fight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time, not battle, that slays.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BRIDEGROOM

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call me not false, beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, from thy scarce-known breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So little time removed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other arms I rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this more ancient bride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom coldly I embrace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was constant at my side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I saw thy face.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our marriage, often set,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By miracle delayed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last is consummate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cannot be unmade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live, then, whom Life shall cure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost, of Memory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave us to endure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its immortality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V. A. D. (MEDITERRANEAN)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, would swift ships had never been, for then we neer had found,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These harsh Ægean rocks between, this little virgin drowned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom neither spouse nor child shall mourn, but men she nursed through pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, certain keels for whose return the heathen look in vain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACTORS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a Memorial Tablet in Holy Trinity Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stratford-on-Avon

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We counterfeited once for your disport
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mens joy and sorrow: but our day has passed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray you pardon all where we fell short
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing we were your servants to this last.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said unto myself, if I were dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would befall these children?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fate, who now are looking up to me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For help and furtherance?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lives, I said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would be a volume wherein I have read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the first chapters, and no longer see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To read the rest of their dear history,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So full of beauty and so full of dread.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be comforted; the world is very old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And generations pass, as they have passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A troop of shadows moving with the sun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of times has the old tale been told;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world belongs to those who come the last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will find hope and strength as we have done.
</pre>

<p>THINK you we slept within the Delphic bower,<br> What time our victim sought Apollo's grace?<br> Nay, drawn into ourselves, in that deep place<br> Where good and evil meet, we bode our hour.<br> For not inexorable is our power.<br> And we are hunted of the prey we chase,<br> Soonest gain ground on them that flee apace,<br> And draw temerity from hearts that cower.<br> <br> Shuddering we gather in the house of ruth,<br> And on the fearful turn a face of fear,<br> But they to whom the ways of doom are clear<br> Not vainly named us the Eumenides.<br> Our feet are faithful in the paths of truth,<br> And in the constant heart we house at peace.</p>

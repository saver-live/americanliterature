<p>It was pleasant up the country, Mr. Banjo, where you went,<br> For you sought the greener patches and you travelled like a gent.,<br> And you curse the trams and 'busses and the turmoil and the "push,"<br> Tho' you know the "squalid city" needn't keep you from the bush;<br> But we lately heard you singing of the "plains where shade is not,"<br> And you mentioned it was dusty - "all is dry and all is hot."<br> <br> True, the bush "hath moods and changes," and the bushman hath 'em, too --<br> For he's not a poet's dummy -- he's a man, the same as you;<br> But his back is growing rounder -- slaving for the "absentee" --<br> And his toiling wife is thinner than a country wife should be,<br> For we noticed that the faces of the folks we chanced to meet<br> Should have made a stronger contrast to the faces in the street;<br> And, in short, we think the bushman's being driven to the wall,<br> But it's doubtful if his spirit will be "<i>loyal</i> thro' it all."<br> <br> Tho' the bush has been romantic and it's nice to sing about,<br> There's a lot of patriotism that the land could do without --<br> Sort of BRITISH WORKMAN nonsense that shall perish in the scorn<br> Of the drover who is driven and the shearer who is shorn --<br> Of the struggling western farmers who have little time for rest,<br> And are ruin'd on selections in the squatter-ridden west --<br> Droving songs are very pretty, but they merit little thanks<br> From the people of country which is ridden by the Banks.<br> <br> And the "rise and fall of seasons" suits the rise and fall of rhyme,<br> But we know that western seasons do not run on "schedule time;"<br> For the drought will go on drying while there's anything to dry,<br> Then it rains until you'd fancy it would bleach the "sunny sky" --<br> Then it pelters out of reason, for the downpour day and night<br> Nearly sweeps the population to the Great Australian Bight,<br> It is up in Northern Queensland that the "seasons" do their best,<br> But its doubtful if you ever saw a season in the west,<br> There are years without an autumn or a winter or a spring,<br> There are broiling Junes -- and summers when it rains like anything.<br> <br> In the bush my ears were opened to the singing of the bird,<br> But the "carol of the magpie" was a thing I never heard.<br> Once the beggar roused my slumbers in a shanty, it is true,<br> But I only heard him asking, "Who the blanky blank are you?"<br> And the bell-bird in the ranges -- but his "silver chime" is harsh<br> When it's heard beside the solo of the curlew in the marsh.<br> <br> Yes, I heard the shearers singing "William Riley" out of tune<br> (Saw 'em fighting round a shanty on a Sunday afternoon),<br> But the bushman isn't always "trapping bunnies in the night,"<br> Nor is he ever riding when "the morn is fresh and bright,"<br> And he isn't always singing in the humpies on the run --<br> And the camp-fire's "cheery blazes" are a trifle overdone;<br> We have grumbled with the bushmen round the fire on rainy days,<br> When the smoke would blind a bullock and there wasn't any blaze,<br> Save the blazes of our language, for we cursed the fire in turn<br> Till the atmosphere was heated and the wood began to burn.<br> Then we had to wring our blueys which were rotting in the swags,<br> And we saw the sugar leaking thro' the bottoms of the bags,<br> And we couldn't raise a "chorus," for the toothache and the cramp,<br> While we spent the hours of darkness draining puddles round the camp.<br> <br> Would you like to change with Clancy -- go a-droving? tell us true,<br> For we rather think that Clancy would be glad to change with you,<br> And be something in the city; but 'twould give your muse a shock<br> To be losing time and money thro' the foot-rot in the flock,<br> And you wouldn't mind the beauties underneath the starry dome<br> If you had a wife and children and a lot of bills at home.<br> <br> Did you ever guard the cattle when the night was inky-black,<br> And it rained, and icy water trickled gently down your back<br> Till your saddle-weary backbone fell a-aching to the roots<br> And you almost felt the croaking of the bull-frog in your boots --<br> Sit and shiver in the saddle, curse the restless stock and cough<br> Till a squatter's irate dummy cantered up to warn you off?<br> Did you fight the drought and "pleuro" when the "seasons" were asleep --<br> Falling she-oaks all the morning for a flock of starving sheep;<br> Drinking mud instead of water -- climbing trees and lopping boughs<br> For the broken-hearted bullocks and the dry and dusty cows?<br> <br> Do you think the bush was better in the "good old droving days,"<br> When the squatter ruled supremely as the king of western ways,<br> When you got a slip of paper for the little you could earn,<br> But were forced to take provisions from the station in return --<br> When you couldn't keep a chicken at your humpy on the run,<br> For the squatter wouldn't let you -- and your work was never done:<br> When you had to leave the missus in a lonely hut forlorn<br> While you "rose up Willy Riley," in the days ere you were born?<br> <br> Ah! we read about the drovers and the shearers and the like<br> Till we wonder why such happy and romantic fellows "strike."<br> Don't you fancy that the poets better give the bush a rest<br> Ere they raise a just rebellion in the over-written West?<br> Where the simple-minded bushman get a meal and bed and rum<br> Just by riding round reporting phantom flocks that never come;<br> Where the scalper -- never troubled by the "war-whoop of the push" --<br> Has a quiet little billet -- breeding rabbits in the bush;<br> Where the idle shanty-keeper never fails to make a "draw,"<br> And the dummy gets his tucker thro' provisions in the law;<br> Where the labour-agitator -- when the shearers rise in might<br> Makes his money sacrificing all his substance for the right;<br> Where the squatter makes his fortune, and the seasons "rise" and "fall,"<br> And the poor and honest bushman has to suffer for it all,<br> Where the drovers and the shearers and the bushmen and the rest<br> Never reach the Eldorado of the poets of the West.<br> <br> And you think the bush is purer and that life is better there,<br> But it doesn't seem to pay you like the "squalid street and square,"<br> Pray inform us, "Mr. Banjo," where you read, in prose or verse,<br> Of the awful "city urchin" who would greet you with a curse.<br> There are golden hearts in gutters, tho' their owners lack the fat,<br> And we'll back a teamster's offspring to outswear a city brat;<br> Do you think we're never jolly where the trams and 'busses rage?<br> Did you hear the "gods" in chorus when "Ri-tooral" held the stage?<br> Did you catch a ring of sorrow in the city urchin's voice<br> When he yelled for "Billy Elton," when he thumped the floor for Royce?<br> Do the bushmen, down on pleasure, miss the everlasting stars<br> When they drink and flirt and so on in the glow of private bars?<br> What care you if fallen women "flaunt?" God help 'em -- let 'em flaunt,<br> And the seamstress seems to haunt you -- to what purpose does she haunt?<br> You've a down on "trams and busses," or the "roar" of 'em, you said,<br> And the "filthy, dirty attic," where you never toiled for bread.<br> (And about that self-same attic, tell us, Banjo, where you've been?<br> For the struggling needlewoman mostly keeps her attic clean.)<br> But you'll find it very jolly with the cuff-and-collar push,<br> And the city seems to suit you, while you rave about the bush.<br> <br> P.S. --<br> <br> You'll admit that "up-the-country," more especially in drought,<br> Isn't quite the Eldorado that the poets rave about,<br> Yet at times we long to gallop where the reckless bushman rides<br> In the wake of startled brumbies that are flying for their hides;<br> Long to feel the saddle tremble once again between our knees<br> And to hear the stockwhips rattle just like rifles in the trees!<br> Long to feel the bridle-leather tugging strongly in the hand<br> And to feel once more a little like a "native of the land."<br> And the ring of bitter feeling in the jingling of our rhymes<br> Isn't suited to the country nor the spirit of the times.<br> Let's us go together droving and returning, if we live,<br> Try to understand each other while we liquor up the "div."<br></p>

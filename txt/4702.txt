&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not with an outcry to Allah nor any complaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered his name at the muster and stood to the chaining.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the twin anklets were nipped on the leg-bars that held them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brotherly greeted the armourers stooping to weld them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the sad dust of the marshalled feet of the chain-gang swallowed him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observing him nobly at ease, I alighted and followed him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we had speech by the way, but not touching his sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather his red Yesterday and his regal To-morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein he statelily moved to the clink of his chains unregarded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowise abashed but contented to drink of the potion awarded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saluting aloofly his Fate, he made swift with his story;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the words of his mouth were as slaves spreading carpets of glory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embroidered with names of the Djinns, a miraculous weaving,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cool and perspicuous eye overbore unbelieving.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I submitted myself to the limits of rapture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound by this man we had bound, amid captives his capture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he returned me to earth and the visions departed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on him be the Peace and the Blessing: for he was great-hearted!

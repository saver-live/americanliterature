<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muse of my native land! loftiest Muse!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O first-born on the mountains! by the hues
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven on the spiritual air begot:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long didst thou sit alone in northern grot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet our England was a wolfish den;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before our forests heard the talk of men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the first of Druids was a child;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long didst thou sit amid our regions wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapt in a deep prophetic solitude.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came an eastern voice of solemn mood:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet wast thou patient. Then sang forth the Nine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo's garland: yet didst thou divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such home-bred glory, that they cry'd in vain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come hither, Sister of the Island!" Plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake fair Ausonia; and once more she spake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A higher summons: still didst thou betake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee to thy native hopes. O thou hast won
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full accomplishment! The thing is done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which undone, these our latter days had risen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On barren souls. Great Muse, thou know'st what prison
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flesh and bone, curbs, and confines, and frets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our spirit's wings: despondency besets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pillows; and the fresh to-morrow morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems to give forth its light in very scorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our dull, uninspired, snail-paced lives.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long have I said, how happy he who shrives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thee! But then I thought on poets gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And could not pray: nor can I now so on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move to the end in lowliness of heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, woe is me! that I should fondly part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my dear native land! Ah, foolish maid!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad was the hour, when, with thee, myriads bade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu to Ganges and their pleasant fields!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one so friendless the clear freshet yields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bitter coolness, the ripe grape is sour:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I would have, great gods! but one short hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of native air let me but die at home."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion to heaven's airy dome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was offering up a hecatomb of vows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these words reach'd him. Whereupon he bows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head through thorny-green entanglement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of underwood, and to the sound is bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxious as hind towards her hidden fawn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is no one near to help me? No fair dawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life from charitable voice? No sweet saying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set my dull and sadden'd spirit playing?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hand to toy with mine? No lips so sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may worship them? No eyelids meet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To twinkle on my bosom? No one dies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before me, till from these enslaving eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redemption sparkles! I am sad and lost."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, Carian lord, hadst better have been tost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a whirlpool. Vanish into air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm mountaineer! for canst thou only bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman's sigh alone and in distress?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See not her charms! Is Phoebe passionless?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phoebe is fairer far O gaze no more:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet if thou wilt behold all beauty's store,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold her panting in the forest grass!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not those curls of glossy jet surpass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tenderness the arms so idly lain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst them? Feelest not a kindred pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see such lovely eyes in swimming search
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some warm delight, that seems to perch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dovelike in the dim cell lying beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their upper lids? Hist! "O for Hermes' wand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch this flower into human shape!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That woodland Hyacinthus could escape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his green prison, and here kneeling down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call me his queen, his second life's fair crown!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me, how I could love! My soul doth melt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the unhappy youth Love! I have felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So faint a kindness, such a meek surrender
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what my own full thoughts had made too tender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That but for tears my life had fled away!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye deaf and senseless minutes of the day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou, old forest, hold ye this for true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no lightning, no authentic dew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eye of love: there's not a sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melodious howsoever, can confound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavens and earth in one to such a death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As doth the voice of love: there's not a breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will mingle kindly with the meadow air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it has panted round, and stolen a share
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of passion from the heart!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a bough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leant, wretched. He surely cannot now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirst for another love: O impious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he can even dream upon it thus!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought he, "Why am I not as are the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since to a woe like this I have been led
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dark earth, and through the wondrous sea?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess! I love thee not the less: from thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Juno's smile I turn not no, no, no
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the great waters are at ebb and flow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a triple soul! O fond pretence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both, for both my love is so immense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel my heart is cut in twain for them."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady's heart beat quick, and he could see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gentle bosom heave tumultuously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sprang from his green covert: there she lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet as a muskrose upon new-made hay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all her limbs on tremble, and her eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut softly up alive. To speak he tries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair damsel, pity me! forgive that I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus violate thy bower's sanctity!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O pardon me, for I am full of grief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief born of thee, young angel! fairest thief!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stolen hast away the wings wherewith
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was to top the heavens. Dear maid, sith
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art my executioner, and I feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loving and hatred, misery and weal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will in a few short hours be nothing to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my story that much passion slew me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do smile upon the evening of my days:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, for my tortur'd brain begins to craze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be thou my nurse; and let me understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How dying I shall kiss that lily hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost weep for me? Then should I be content.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scowl on, ye fates! until the firmament
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outblackens Erebus, and the full-cavern'd earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crumbles into itself. By the cloud girth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Jove, those tears have given me a thirst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet oblivion." As her heart would burst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maiden sobb'd awhile, and then replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why must such desolation betide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As that thou speakest of? Are not these green nooks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empty of all misfortune? Do the brooks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utter a gorgon voice? Does yonder thrush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schooling its half-fledg'd little ones to brush
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the dewy forest, whisper tales?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak not of grief, young stranger, or cold snails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will slime the rose to night. Though if thou wilt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methinks 'twould be a guilt a very guilt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to companion thee, and sigh away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light the dusk the dark till break of day!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear lady," said Endymion, "'tis past:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love thee! and my days can never last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may pass in patience still speak:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me have music dying, and I seek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more delight I bid adieu to all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didst thou not after other climates call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmur about Indian streams?" Then she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting beneath the midmost forest tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pity sang this roundelay


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost borrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural hue of health, from vermeil lips?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give maiden blushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the white rose bushes?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost borrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lustrous passion from a falcon-eye?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give the glow-worm light?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, on a moonless night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tinge, on syren shores, the salt sea-spry?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost borrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mellow ditties from a mourning tongue?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give at evening pale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the nightingale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou mayst listen the cold dews among?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost borrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart's lightness from the merriment of May?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lover would not tread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cowslip on the head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he should dance from eve till peep of day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any drooping flower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held sacred for thy bower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever he may sport himself and play.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To Sorrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bade good-morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought to leave her far away behind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cheerly, cheerly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loves me dearly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so constant to me, and so kind:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would deceive her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so leave her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ah! she is so constant and so kind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat a weeping: in the whole world wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no one to ask me why I wept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brimming the water-lily cups with tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold as my fears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat a weeping: what enamour'd bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheated by shadowy wooer from the clouds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hides and shrouds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath dark palm trees by a river side?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And as I sat, over the light blue hills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came a noise of revellers: the rills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the wide stream came of purple hue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas Bacchus and his crew!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earnest trumpet spake, and silver thrills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From kissing cymbals made a merry din
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas Bacchus and his kin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to a moving vintage down they came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crown'd with green leaves, and faces all on flame;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All madly dancing through the pleasant valley,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To scare thee, Melancholy!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O then, O then, thou wast a simple name!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I forgot thee, as the berried holly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By shepherds is forgotten, when, in June,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall chesnuts keep away the sun and moon:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rush'd into the folly!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Within his car, aloft, young Bacchus stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trifling his ivy-dart, in dancing mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sidelong laughing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And little rills of crimson wine imbrued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plump white arms, and shoulders, enough white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Venus' pearly bite;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And near him rode Silenus on his ass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelted with flowers as he on did pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tipsily quaffing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whence came ye, merry Damsels! whence came ye!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many, and so many, and such glee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have ye left your bowers desolate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your lutes, and gentler fate?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We follow Bacchus! Bacchus on the wing?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conquering!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacchus, young Bacchus! good or ill betide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We dance before him thorough kingdoms wide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come hither, lady fair, and joined be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To our wild minstrelsy!'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whence came ye, jolly Satyrs! whence came ye!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many, and so many, and such glee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have ye left your forest haunts, why left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your nuts in oak-tree cleft?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wine, for wine we left our kernel tree;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wine we left our heath, and yellow brooms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cold mushrooms;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wine we follow Bacchus through the earth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great God of breathless cups and chirping mirth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come hither, lady fair, and joined be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To our mad minstrelsy!'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Over wide streams and mountains great we went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, save when Bacchus kept his ivy tent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward the tiger and the leopard pants,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Asian elephants:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward these myriads with song and dance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With zebras striped, and sleek Arabians' prance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web-footed alligators, crocodiles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing upon their scaly backs, in files,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plump infant laughers mimicking the coil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of seamen, and stout galley-rowers' toil:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With toying oars and silken sails they glide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor care for wind and tide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mounted on panthers' furs and lions' manes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From rear to van they scour about the plains;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A three days' journey in a moment done:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And always, at the rising of the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the wilds they hunt with spear and horn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On spleenful unicorn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw Osirian Egypt kneel adown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the vine-wreath crown!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw parch'd Abyssinia rouse and sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the silver cymbals' ring!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the whelming vintage hotly pierce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Tartary the fierce!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kings of Inde their jewel-sceptres vail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from their treasures scatter pearled hail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Brahma from his mystic heaven groans,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his priesthood moans;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before young Bacchus' eye-wink turning pale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into these regions came I following him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick hearted, weary so I took a whim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stray away into these forests drear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, without a peer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have told thee all thou mayest hear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young stranger!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been a ranger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In search of pleasure throughout every clime:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! 'tis not for me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bewitch'd I sure must be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose in grieving all my maiden prime.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come then, Sorrow!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetest Sorrow!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an own babe I nurse thee on my breast:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought to leave thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deceive thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now of all the world I love thee best.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is not one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, not one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thee to comfort a poor lonely maid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art her mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her playmate, and her wooer in the shade."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O what a sigh she gave in finishing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look, quite dead to every worldly thing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion could not speak, but gazed on her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listened to the wind that now did stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the crisped oaks full drearily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet with as sweet a softness as might be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember'd from its velvet summer song.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he said: "Poor lady, how thus long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I been able to endure that voice?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Melody! kind Syren! I've no choice;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must be thy sad servant evermore:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot choose but kneel here and adore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, I must not think by Phoebe, no!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me not think, soft Angel! shall it be so?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, beautifullest, shall I never think?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou could'st foster me beyond the brink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of recollection! make my watchful care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close up its bloodshot eyes, nor see despair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do gently murder half my soul, and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall feel the other half so utterly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm giddy at that cheek so fair and smooth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let it blush so ever! let it soothe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My madness! let it mantle rosy-warm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tinge of love, panting in safe alarm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be thy hand, and yet it is;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is sure thine other softling this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine own fair bosom, and I am so near!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt fall asleep? O let me sip that tear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whisper one sweet word that I may know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is this world sweet dewy blossom!" Woe!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe! Woe to that Endymion! Where is he?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even these words went echoing dismally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the wide forest a most fearful tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one repenting in his latest moan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while it died away a shade pass'd by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of a thunder cloud. When arrows fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their timid necks and tremble; so these both
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leant to each other trembling, and sat so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for some destruction when lo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foot-feather'd Mercury appear'd sublime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the tall tree tops; and in less time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moment from his home: only the sward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He with his wand light touch'd, and heavenward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter than sight was gone even before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teeming earth a sudden witness bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his swift magic. Diving swans appear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the crystal circlings white and clear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they can dive in sight and unseen rise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the turf outsprang two steeds jet-black,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each with large dark blue wings upon his back.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth of Caria plac'd the lovely dame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one, and felt himself in spleen to tame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other's fierceness. Through the air they flew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High as the eagles. Like two drops of dew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhal'd to Phoebus' lips, away they are gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the earth away unseen, alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among cool clouds and winds, but that the free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buoyant life of song can floating be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above their heads, and follow them untir'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muse of my native land, am I inspir'd?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the giddy air, and I must spread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide pinions to keep here; nor do I dread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or height, or depth, or width, or any chance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precipitous: I have beneath my glance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those towering horses and their mournful freight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I thus sail, and see, and thus await
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearless for power of thought, without thine aid?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From some approaching wonder, and behold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying to embers from their native fire!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There curl'd a purple mist around them; soon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seem'd as when around the pale new moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad Zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas Sleep slow journeying with head on pillow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, since he came nigh dead born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the old womb of night, his cave forlorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he left more forlorn; for the first time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt aloof the day and morning's prime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because into his depth Cimmerian
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came a dream, shewing how a young man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere a lean bat could plump its wintery skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would at high Jove's empyreal footstool win
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An immortality, and how espouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jove's daughter, and be reckon'd of his house.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now was he slumbering towards heaven's gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he might at the threshold one hour wait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear the marriage melodies, and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sink downward to his dusky cave again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His litter of smooth semilucent mist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversely ting'd with rose and amethyst,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puzzled those eyes that for the centre sought;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scarcely for one moment could be caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sluggish form reposing motionless.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those two on winged steeds, with all the stress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of vision search'd for him, as one would look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athwart the sallows of a river nook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch a glance at silver throated eels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or from old Skiddaw's top, when fog conceals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His rugged forehead in a mantle pale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descry a favourite hamlet faint and far.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These raven horses, though they foster'd are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of earth's splenetic fire, dully drop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their full-veined ears, nostrils blood wide, and stop;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the spiritless mist have they outspread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ample feathers, are in slumber dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on those pinions, level in mid air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion sleepeth and the lady fair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly they sail, slowly as icy isle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a calm sea drifting: and meanwhile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mournful wanderer dreams. Behold! he walks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To divine powers: from his hand full fain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tries the nerve of Phoebus' golden bow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And asketh where the golden apples grow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his arm he braces Pallas' shield,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strives in vain to unsettle and wield
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blows a bugle, an ethereal band
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are visible above: the Seasons four,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green-kyrtled Spring, flush Summer, golden store
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Autumn's sickle, Winter frosty hoar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In swells unmitigated, still doth last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sway their floating morris. "Whose is this?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose bugle?" he inquires: they smile "O Dis!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this mortal here? Dost thou not know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mistress' lips? Not thou? 'Tis Dian's: lo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rises crescented!" He looks, 'tis she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His very goddess: good-bye earth, and sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And air, and pains, and care, and suffering;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards her, and awakes and, strange, o'erhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those same fragrant exhalations bred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beheld awake his very dream: the gods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Phoebe bends towards him crescented.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O state perplexing! On the pinion bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too well awake, he feels the panting side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his delicious lady. He who died
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For soaring too audacious in the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where that same treacherous wax began to run,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not help but kiss her: then he grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awhile forgetful of all beauty save
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Phoebe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgiveness: yet he turn'd once more to look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sweet sleeper, all his soul was shook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She press'd his hand in slumber; so once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not help but kiss her and adore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this the shadow wept, melting away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Latmian started up: "Bright goddess, stay!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search my most hidden breast! By truth's own tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no dædale heart: why is it wrung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To desperation? Is there nought for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the bourne of bliss, but misery?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 'haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What horrors may discomfort thee and me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet did she merely weep her gentle soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath no revenge in it: as it is whole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tenderness, would I were whole in love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I prize thee, fair maid, all price above,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when I feel as true as innocence?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, I do. What is this soul then? Whence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came it? It does not seem my own, and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have no self-passion or identity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fearful end must be: where, where is it?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Nemesis, I see my spirit flit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone about the dark Forgive me, sweet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we away?" He rous'd the steeds: they beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wings chivalrous into the clear air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vesper, risen star, began to throe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dusk heavens silvery, when they
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal oaths and vows they interchange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such wise, in such temper, so aloof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So witless of their doom, that verily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy'd.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon put forth a little diamond peak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bigger than an unobserved star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or tiny point of fairy scymetar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright signal that she only stoop'd to tie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her silver sandals, ere deliciously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bow'd into the heavens her timid head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While to his lady meek the Carian turn'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beauty in its birth Despair! despair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw her body fading gaunt and spare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, horror! kiss'd his own he was alone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her steed a little higher soar'd, and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropt hawkwise to the earth. There lies a den,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the seeming confines of the space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made for the soul to wander in and trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its own existence, of remotest glooms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark regions are around it, where the tombs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of new-born woe it feels more inly smart:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in these regions many a venom'd dart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At random flies; they are the proper home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every ill: the man is yet to come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath not journeyed in this native hell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But few have ever felt how calm and well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep may be had in that deep den of all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet all is still within and desolate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beset with painful gusts, within ye hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when the sufferer begins to burn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it is free to him; and from an urn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Semele such richness never quaft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her maternal longing. Happy gloom!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of health by due; where silence dreariest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is most articulate; where hopes infest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where those eyes are the brightest far that keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnant with such a den to save the whole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, never since thy griefs and woes began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou felt so content: a grievous feud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he knew not whither he was going.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So happy was he, not the aerial blowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of trumpets at clear parley from the east
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could lift Endymion's head, or he had view'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silvery was its passing: voices sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warbling the while as if to lull and greet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While past the vision went in bright array.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who, who from Dian's feast would be away?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the golden bowers of the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are empty left? Who, who away would be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Cynthia's wedding and festivity?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Hesperus: lo! upon his silver wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leans away for highest heaven and sings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snapping his lucid fingers merrily!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Zephyrus! art here, and Flora too!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye tender bibbers of the rain and dew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young playmates of the rose and daffodil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful, ere ye enter in, to fill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your baskets high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fennel green, and balm, and golden pines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savory, latter-mint, and columbines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool parsley, basil sweet, and sunny thyme;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, every flower and leaf of every clime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All gather'd in the dewy morning: hie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away! fly, fly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystalline brother of the belt of heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aquarius! to whom king Jove has given
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two liquid pulse streams 'stead of feather'd wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two fan-like fountains, thine illuminings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Dian play:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolve the frozen purity of air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let thy white shoulders silvery and bare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shew cold through watery pinions; make more bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Star-Queen's crescent on her marriage night:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haste, haste away!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Castor has tamed the planet Lion, see!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the Bear has Pollux mastery:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third is in the race! who is the third,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speeding away swift as the eagle bird?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ramping Centaur!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion's mane's on end: the Bear how fierce!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centaur's arrow ready seems to pierce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some enemy: far forth his bow is bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the blue of heaven. He'll be shent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale unrelentor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he shall hear the wedding lutes a playing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andromeda! sweet woman! why delaying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So timidly among the stars: come hither!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join this bright throng, and nimbly follow whither
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all are going.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danae's Son, before Jove newly bow'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has wept for thee, calling to Jove aloud.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee, gentle lady, did he disenthral:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall for ever live and love, for all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy tears are flowing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Daphne's fright, behold Apollo! "

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion heard not: down his steed him bore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prone to the green head of a misty hill.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first touch of the earth went nigh to kill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas!" said he, "were I but always borne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through dangerous winds, had but my footsteps worn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A path in hell, for ever would I bless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horrors which nourish an uneasiness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my own sullen conquering: to him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lives beyond earth's boundary, grief is dim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow is but a shadow: now I see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass; I feel the solid ground Ah, me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thy voice divinest! Where? who? who
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left thee so quiet on this bed of dew?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold upon this happy earth we are;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ay love each other; let us fare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On forest-fruits, and never, never go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the abodes of mortals here below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or be by phantoms duped. O destiny!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a labyrinth now my soul would fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with thy beauty will I deaden it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where didst thou melt too? By thee will I sit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever: let our fate stop here a kid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I on this spot will offer: Pan will bid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us live in peace, in love and peace among
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His forest wildernesses. I have clung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or felt but a great dream! O I have been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumptuous against love, against the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against all elements, against the tie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mortals each to each, against the blooms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowers, rush of rivers, and the tombs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heroes gone! Against his proper glory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has my own soul conspired: so my story
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will I to children utter, and repent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There never liv'd a mortal man, who bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His appetite beyond his natural sphere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But starv'd and died. My sweetest Indian, here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here will I kneel, for thou redeemed hast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life from too thin breathing: gone and past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are cloudy phantasms. Caverns lone, farewel!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And air of visions, and the monstrous swell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of visionary seas! No, never more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall airy voices cheat me to the shore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tangled wonder, breathless and aghast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu, my daintiest Dream! although so vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love is still for thee. The hour may come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we shall meet in pure elysium.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On earth I may not love thee; and therefore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doves will I offer up, and sweetest store
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All through the teeming year: so thou wilt shine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On me, and on this damsel fair of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bless our simple lives. My Indian bliss!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My river-lily bud! one human kiss!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sigh of real breath one gentle squeeze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm as a dove's nest among summer trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And warm with dew at ooze from living blood!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whither didst melt? Ah, what of that! all good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll talk about no more of dreaming. Now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shall our dwelling be? Under the brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would hide us up, although spring leaves were none;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin'd:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For by one step the blue sky shouldst thou find,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by another, in deep dell below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, through the trees, a little river go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in its mid-day gold and glimmering.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey from out the gnarled hive I'll bring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And apples, wan with sweetness, gather thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cresses that grow where no man may them see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sorrel untorn by the dew-claw'd stag:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pipes will I fashion of the syrinx flag,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou mayst always know whither I roam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it shall please thee in our quiet home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To listen and think of love. Still let me speak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still let me dive into the joy I seek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For yet the past doth prison me. The rill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou haply mayst delight in, will I fill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou shalt feed them from the squirrel's barn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its bottom will I strew with amber shells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its sides I'll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will entice this crystal rill to trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's silver name upon the meadow's face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll kneel to Vesta, for a flame of fire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to god Phoebus, for a golden lyre;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Empress Dian, for a hunting spear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Vesper, for a taper silver-clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may see thy beauty through the night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Flora, and a nightingale shall light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tame on thy finger; to the River-gods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they shall bring thee taper fishing-rods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gold, and lines of Naiads' long bright tress.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy mossy footstool shall the altar be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fore which I'll bend, bending, dear love, to thee:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those lips shall be my Delphos, and shall speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws to my footsteps, colour to my cheek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling or stedfastness to this same voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of three sweetest pleasurings the choice:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that affectionate light, those diamond things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be my grief, or twinkle me to pleasure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, is not bliss within our perfect seisure?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O that I could not doubt?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountaineer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His briar'd path to some tranquillity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gave bright gladness to his lady's eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answering thus, just as the golden morrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beam'd upward from the vallies of the east:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O that the flutter of this heart had ceas'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the sweet name of love had pass'd away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young feather'd tyrant! by a swift decay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt thou devote this body to the earth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do think that at my very birth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lisp'd thy blooming titles inwardly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For at the first, first dawn and thought of thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With uplift hands I blest the stars of heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou not cruel? Ever have I striven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When yet a child, I heard that kisses drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Favour from thee, and so I kisses gave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the void air, bidding them find out love:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I came to feel how far above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All earthly pleasure, all imagin'd good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the warm tremble of a devout kiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then, that moment, at the thought of this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fainting I fell into a bed of flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And languish'd there three days. Ye milder powers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I not cruelly wrong'd? Believe, believe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me, dear Endymion, were I to weave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my own fancies garlands of sweet life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shouldst be one of all. Ah, bitter strife!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not be thy love: I am forbidden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed I am thwarted, affrighted, chidden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice hast thou ask'd whither I went: henceforth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask me no more! I may not utter it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor may I be thy love. We might commit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ourselves at once to vengeance; we might die;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might embrace and die: voluptuous thought!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enlarge not to my hunger, or I'm caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trammels of perverse deliciousness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, that shall not be: thee will I bless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bid a long adieu."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Carian
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No word return'd: both lovelorn, silent, wan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the vallies green together went.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far wandering, they were perforce content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sit beneath a fair lone beechen tree;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor at each other gaz'd, but heavily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Por'd on its hazle cirque of shedded leaves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion! unhappy! it nigh grieves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me to behold thee thus in last extreme:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensky'd ere this, but truly that I deem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth the best music in a first-born song.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy lute-voic'd brother will I sing ere long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou shalt aid hast thou not aided me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, moonlight Emperor! felicity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been thy meed for many thousand years;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet often have I, on the brink of tears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mourn'd as if yet thou wert a forester,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting the old tale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes from the dead leaves, or one small pulse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of joy he might have felt. The spirit culls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfaded amaranth, when wild it strays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the old garden-ground of boyish days.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little onward ran the very stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By which he took his first soft poppy dream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the very bark 'gainst which he leant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crescent he had carv'd, and round it spent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His skill in little stars. The teeming tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had swollen and green'd the pious charactery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not ta'en out. Why, there was not a slope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up which he had not fear'd the antelope;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a tree, beneath whose rooty shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had not with his tamed leopards play'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor could an arrow light, or javelin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly in the air where his had never been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet he knew it not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O treachery!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does his lady smile, pleasing her eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all his sorrowing? He sees her not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who so stares on him? His sister sure!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peona of the woods! Can she endure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible how dearly they embrace!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lady smiles; delight is in her face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no treachery.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear brother mine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion, weep not so! Why shouldst thou pine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all great Latmos so exalt wilt be?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank the great gods, and look not bitterly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speak not one pale word, and sigh no more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure I will not believe thou hast such store
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of grief, to last thee to my kiss again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou surely canst not bear a mind in pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come hand in hand with one so beautiful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be happy both of you! for I will pull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers of autumn for your coronals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan's holy priest for young Endymion calls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he is restor'd, thou, fairest dame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shalt be our queen. Now, is it not a shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see ye thus, not very, very sad?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps ye are too happy to be glad:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O feel as if it were a common day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free-voic'd as one who never was away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No tongue shall ask, whence come ye? but ye shall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be gods of your own rest imperial.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even I, for one whole month, will pry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the hours that have pass'd us by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since in my arbour I did sing to thee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Hermes! on this very night will be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hymning up to Cynthia, queen of light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the soothsayers old saw yesternight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good visions in the air, whence will befal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As say these sages, health perpetual
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shepherds and their flocks; and furthermore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Dian's face they read the gentle lore:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore for her these vesper-carols are.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friends will all be there from nigh and far.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many upon thy death have ditties made;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many, even now, their foreheads shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With cypress, on a day of sacrifice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New singing for our maids shalt thou devise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pluck the sorrow from our huntsmen's brows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, my lady-queen, how to espouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wayward brother to his rightful joys!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are on thee bent, as thou didst poise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fate most goddess-like. Help me, I pray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lure Endymion, dear brother, say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ails thee?" He could bear no more, and so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twang'd it inwardly, and calmly said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would have thee my only friend, sweet maid!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only visitor! not ignorant though,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That those deceptions which for pleasure go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mong men, are pleasures real as real may be:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are higher ones I may not see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If impiously an earthly realm I take.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I saw thee, I have been wide awake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night after night, and day by day, until
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the empyrean I have drunk my fill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it content thee, Sister, seeing me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More happy than betides mortality.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hermit young, I'll live in mossy cave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where thou alone shalt come to me, and lave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy spirit in the wonders I shall tell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through me the shepherd realm shall prosper well;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For to thy tongue will I all health confide.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, for my sake, let this young maid abide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thee as a dear sister. Thou alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peona, mayst return to me. I own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may sound strangely: but when, dearest girl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou seest it for my happiness, no pearl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will trespass down those cheeks. Companion fair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt be content to dwell with her, to share
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sister's love with me?" Like one resign'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bent by circumstance, and thereby blind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In self-commitment, thus that meek unknown:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of jubilee to Dian: truth I heard!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well then, I see there is no little bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender soever, but is Jove's own care.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long have I sought for rest, and, unaware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold I find it! so exalted too!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after my own heart! I knew, I knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a place untenanted in it:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same void white Chastity shall sit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And monitor me nightly to lone slumber.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sanest lips I vow me to the number
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Dian's sisterhood; and, kind lady,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thy good help, this very night shall see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My future days to her fane consecrate."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As feels a dreamer what doth most create
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own particular fright, so these three felt:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or like one who, in after ages, knelt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Lucifer or Baal, when he'd pine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little sleep: or when in mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who know him not. Each diligently bends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards common thoughts and things for very fear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Striving their ghastly malady to cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By thinking it a thing of yes and no,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion said: "Are not our fates all cast?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu!" Whereat those maidens, with wild stare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk'd dizzily away. Pained and hot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes went after them, until they got
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one swift moment, would what then he saw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engulph for ever. "Stay!" he cried, "ah, stay!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Indian, I would see thee once again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a thing I dote on: so I'd fain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peona, ye should hand in hand repair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into those holy groves, that silent are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind great Dian's temple. I'll be yon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At vesper's earliest twinkle they are gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once, once, once again " At this he press'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands against his face, and then did rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head upon a mossy hillock green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so remain'd as he a corpse had been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the long day; save when he scantly lifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the slow move of time, sluggish and weary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the poplar tops, in journey dreary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had reach'd the river's brim. Then up he rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, slowly as that very river flows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk'd towards the temple grove with this lament:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the serene father of them all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bows down his summer head below the west.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the setting I must bid adieu
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her for the last time. Night will strew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with them shall I die; nor much it grieves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To die, when summer dies on the cold sward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My kingdom's at its death, and just it is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should die with it: so in all this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there to plain of? By Titan's foe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am but rightly serv'd." So saying, he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though they jests had been: nor had he done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His laugh at nature's holy countenance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until that grove appear'd, as if perchance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his tongue with sober seemlihed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave utterance as he entered: "Ha!" I said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dusk religion, pomp of solitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Promethean clay by thief endued,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By old Saturnus' forelock, by his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself to things of light from infancy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sure enough to make a mortal man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow impious." So he inwardly began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On things for which no wording can be found;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the reach of music: for the choir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wan as primroses gather'd at midnight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By chilly finger'd spring. "Unhappy wight!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endymion!" said Peona, "we are here!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press'd, saying:" Sister, I would have command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were heaven's will, on our sad fate."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Endymion's amaze: "By Cupid's dove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as she spake, into her face there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light, as reflected from a silver flame:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phoebe, his passion! joyous she upheld
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lucid bow, continuing thus; "Drear, drear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has our delaying been; but foolish fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withheld me first; and then decrees of fate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then 'twas fit that from this mortal state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These forests, and to thee they safe shall be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet us many a time." Next Cynthia bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave her fair hands to him, and behold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before three swiftest kisses he had told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They vanish'd far away! Peona went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment.

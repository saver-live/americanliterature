<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet are the pleasures that to verse belong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And doubly sweet a brotherhood in song;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor can remembrance, Mathew! bring to view
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fate more pleasing, a delight more true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than that in which the brother Poets joy'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who with combined powers, their wit employ'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise a trophy to the drama's muses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of this great partnership diffuses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the genius loving heart, a feeling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that's high, and great, and good, and healing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too partial friend! fain would I follow thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past each horizon of fine poesy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fain would I echo back each pleasant note
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As o'er Sicilian seas, clear anthems float
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mong the light skimming gondolas far parted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when the sun his farewell beam has darted:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 'tis impossible, far different cares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckon me sternly from soft "Lydian airs,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold my faculties so long in thrall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I am oft in doubt whether at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall again see Phoebus in the morning:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or flush'd Aurora in the roseate dawning!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a white Naiad in a rippling stream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a rapt seraph in a moonlight beam;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or again witness what with thee I've seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dew by fairy feet swept from the green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a night of some quaint jubilee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which every elf and fay had come to see:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When bright processions took their airy march
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the curved moon's triumphal arch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But might I now each passing moment give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the coy muse, with me she would not live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this dark city, nor would condescend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid contradictions her delights to lend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should e'er the fine-eyed maid to me be kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! surely it must be whene'er I find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some flowery spot, sequester'd, wild, romantic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That often must have seen a poet frantic;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where oaks, that erst the Druid knew, are growing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowers, the glory of one day, are blowing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the dark-leav'd laburnum's drooping clusters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflect athwart the stream their yellow lustres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And intertwined the cassia's arms unite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its own drooping buds, but very white.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where on one side are covert branches hung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mong which the nightingales have always sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leafy quiet; where to pry, aloof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atween the pillars of the sylvan roof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would be to find where violet beds were nestling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where the bee with cowslip bells was wrestling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be too a ruin dark, and gloomy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say "joy not too much in all that's bloomy."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet this is vain, O Mathew lend thy aid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find a place where I may greet the maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we may soft humanity put on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sit, and rhyme and think on Chatterton;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that warm-hearted Shakspeare sent to meet him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four laurell'd spirits, heaven-ward to intreat him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reverence would we speak of all the sages
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have left streaks of light athwart their ages:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou shouldst moralize on Milton's blindness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mourn the fearful dearth of human kindness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who strove with the bright golden wing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of genius, to flap away each sting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrown by the pitiless world. We next could tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who in the cause of freedom fell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our own Alfred, of Helvetian Tell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of him whose name to ev'ry heart's a solace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-minded and unbending William Wallace.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While to the rugged north our musing turns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We well might drop a tear for him, and Burns.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felton! without incitements such as these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How vain for me the niggard Muse to tease;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thee, she will thy every dwelling grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make "a sunshine in a shady place:"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thou wast once a flowret blooming wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to the source, bright, pure, and undefil'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence gush the streams of song: in happy hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came chaste Diana from her shady bower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the sun was from the east uprising;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as for him some gift she was devising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beheld thee, pluck'd thee, cast thee in the stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet her glorious brothers greeting beam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I marvel much that thou hast never told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, from a flower, into a fish of gold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo chang'd thee; how thou next didst seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black-eyed swan upon the widening stream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when thou first didst in that mirror trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The placid features of a human face:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou hast never told thy travels strange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the wonders of the mazy range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oer pebbly crystal, and o'er golden sands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissing thy daily food from Naiads pearly hands.

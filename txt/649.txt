<p>My friend lives high on East Mountain.<br> His nature is to love the hills and gorges.<br> In green spring he sleeps in empty woodland,<br> Still there when the noon sun brightens.<br> Pine-tree winds to dust his hair.<br> Rock-filled streams to cleanse his senses.<br> Free of all sound and stress,<br> Resting on a wedge of cloud and mist. <br></p>

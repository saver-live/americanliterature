Aloof they crown the foreland lone,
  From aloft they loftier riseâ€”
Fair columns, in the aureole rolled
  From sunned Greek seas and skies.
They wax, sublimed to fancy's view,
A god-like group against the blue.
Over much like gods! Serene they saw
  The wolf-waves board the deck,
And headlong hull of Falconer,
  And many a deadlier wreck.

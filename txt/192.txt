<p>Two Men were traveling in company through a forest, when, all at once, a huge Bear crashed out of the brush near them.</p><p>One of the Men, thinking of his own safety, climbed a tree.</p><p>The other, unable to fight the savage beast alone, threw himself on the ground and lay still, as if he were dead. He had heard that a Bear will not touch a dead body.</p><p>It must have been true, for the Bear snuffed at the Man's head awhile, and then, seeming to be satisfied that he was dead, walked away.</p><p>The Man in the tree climbed down.</p><p>"It looked just as if that Bear whispered in your ear," he said. "What did he tell you?"</p><p>"He said," answered the other, "that it was not at all wise to keep company with a fellow who would desert his friend in a moment of danger."</p><p class="center"><i>Misfortune is the test of true friendship.</i></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p>

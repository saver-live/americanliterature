<p>Like a white stone deep in a draw-well lying,<br> As hard and clear, a memory lies in me.<br> I cannot strive nor have I heart for striving:<br> It is such pain and yet such ecstasy.<br> <br> It seems to me that someone looking closely<br> Into my eyes would see it, patent, pale.<br> And, seeing, would grow sadder and more thoughtful<br> Than one who listens to a bitter tale.<br> <br> The ancient gods changed men to things, but left them<br> A consciousness that smoldered endlessly,<br> That splendid sorrows might endure forever.<br> And you are changed into a memory.</p>

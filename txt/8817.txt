<p>UPWARD we went by fields of asphodel,<br> Leaving Ortygia's moat-bound walls below;<br> By orchards, where the wind-flowers' drifted snow<br> Lay lightly heaped upon the turf's light swell;<br> By gardens, whence upon the wayside fell<br> Jasmine and rose in April's overflow;<br> Till, winding up in Epipolae's wide brow,<br> We reached at last the lonely citadel.<br> <br> There, on the ruined rampart climbing high,<br> We sat and dreamed among the browsing sheep,<br> Until we heard the trumpet's startled cry<br> Waking a clang of arms about the keep,<br> And seaward saw, with rapt foreboding eye,<br> The sails of Athens whiten on the deep.</p>

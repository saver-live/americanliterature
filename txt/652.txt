<p>I took a small path leading<br> up a hill valley, finding there<br> a temple, its gate covered<br> with moss, and in front of<br> the door but tracks of birds;<br> in the room of the old monk<br> no one was living, and I<br> staring through the window<br> saw but a hair duster hanging<br> on the wall, itself covered<br> with dust; emptily I sighed<br> thinking to go, but then<br> turning back several times,<br> seeing how the mist on<br> the hills was flying, and then<br> a light rain fell as if it<br> were flowers falling from<br> the sky, making a music of<br> its own; away in the distance<br> came the cry of a monkey, and<br> for me the cares of the world<br> slipped away, and I was filled<br> with the beauty around me. <br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once on a time, some centuries ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hot sunshine two Franciscan friars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wended their weary way with footsteps slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to their convent, whose white walls and spires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed on the hillside like a patch of snow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered with dust they were, and torn by briers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore like sumpter-mules upon their backs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge of poverty, their beggar's sacks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first was Brother Anthony, a spare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silent man, with pallid cheeks and thin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much given to vigils, penance, fasting, prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemn and gray, and worn with discipline,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if his body but white ashes were,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaped on the living coals that glowed within;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple monk, like many of his day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose instinct was to listen and obey.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A different man was Brother Timothy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of larger mould and of a coarser paste;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rubicund and stalwart monk was he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad in the shoulders, broader in the waist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who often filled the dull refectory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With noise by which the convent was disgraced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to the mass-book gave but little heed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By reason he had never learned to read.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as they passed the outskirts of a wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw, with mingled pleasure and surprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast tethered to a tree an ass, that stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazily winking his large, limpid eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer Gilbert of that neighborhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His owner was, who, looking for supplies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fagots, deeper in the wood had strayed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving his beast to ponder in the shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Brother Timothy espied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient animal, he said: "Good-lack!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus for our needs doth Providence provide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll lay our wallets on the creature's back."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being done, he leisurely untied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From head and neck the halter of the jack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put it round his own, and to the tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood tethered fast as if the ass were he.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, bursting forth into a merry laugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried to Brother Anthony: "Away!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drive the ass before you with your staff;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you reach the convent you may say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You left me at a farm, half tired and half
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill with a fever, for a night and day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the farmer lent this ass to bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our wallets, that are heavy with good fare."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Brother Anthony, who knew the pranks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Brother Timothy, would not persuade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or reason with him on his quirks and cranks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, being obedient, silently obeyed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, smiting with his staff the ass's flanks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove him before him over hill and glade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe with his provend to the convent gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving poor Brother Timothy to his fate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gilbert, laden with fagots for his fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth issued from the wood, and stood aghast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the ponderous body of the friar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing where he had left his donkey last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling he stood, and dared not venture nigher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stared, and gaped, and crossed himself full fast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, being credulous and of little wit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it was some demon from the pit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While speechless and bewildered thus he gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropped his load of fagots on the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth Brother Timothy: "Be not amazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That where you left a donkey should be found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poor Franciscan friar, half-starved and crazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing demure and with a halter bound;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But set me free, and hear the piteous story
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Brother Timothy of Casal-Maggiore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a sinful man, although you see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wear the consecrated cowl and cape;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never owned an ass, but you owned me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed and transformed from my own natural shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All for the deadly sin of gluttony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which I could not otherwise escape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than by this penance, dieting on grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And being worked and beaten as an ass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think of the ignominy I endured;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the miserable life I led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toil and blows to which I was inured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wretched lodging in a windy shed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My scanty fare so grudgingly procured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damp and musty straw that formed my bed!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, having done this penance for my sins,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life as man and monk again begins."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple Gilbert, hearing words like these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was conscience-stricken, and fell down apace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the friar upon his bended knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a suppliant voice implored his grace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good monk, now very much at ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted him pardon with a smiling face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor could refuse to be that night his guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It being late, and he in need of rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a hillside, where the olive thrives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With figures painted on its white-washed walls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cottage stood; and near the humming hives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made murmurs as of far-off waterfalls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place where those who love secluded lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might live content, and, free from noise and brawls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Claudian's Old Man of Verona here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measure by fruits the slow-revolving year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, coming to this cottage of content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found his children, and the buxom wench
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, Dame Cicely, and his father, bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With years and labor, seated on a bench,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeating over some obscure event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old wars of Milanese and French;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All welcomed the Franciscan, with a sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sacred awe and humble reverence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gilbert told them what had come to pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beyond question, cavil, or surmise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Brother Timothy had been their ass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have seen the wonder in their eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have heard them cry, "Alas! alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have heard their lamentations and their sighs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all believed the story, and began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see a saint in this afflicted man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith there was prepared a grand repast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To satisfy the craving of the friar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so rigid and prolonged a fast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bustling housewife stirred the kitchen fire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then her two barnyard fowls, her best and last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were put to death, at her express desire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And served up with a salad in a bowl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flasks of country wine to crown the whole.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be believed should I repeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How hungry Brother Timothy appeared;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasure but to see him eat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white teeth flashing through his russet beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face aglow and flushed with wine and meat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His roguish eyes that rolled and laughed and leered!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord! how he drank the blood-red country wine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the village vintage were divine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the while he talked without surcease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told his merry tales with jovial glee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never flagged, but rather did increase,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laughed aloud as if insane were he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wagged his red beard, matted like a fleece,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cast such glances at Dame Cicely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Gilbert now grew angry with his guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus in words his rising wrath expressed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good father," said he, "easily we see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How needful in some persons, and how right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortification of the flesh may be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indulgence you have given it to-night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After long penance, clearly proves to me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your strength against temptation is but slight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shows the dreadful peril you are in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a relapse into your deadly sin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To-morrow morning, with the rising sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go back unto your convent, nor refrain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From fasting and from scourging, for you run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great danger to become an ass again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since monkish flesh and asinine are one;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore be wise, nor longer here remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you wish the scourge should be applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By other hands, that will not spare your hide."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this the monk had heard, his color fled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then returned, like lightning in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he was all one blush from foot to head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the bald spot in his russet hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned from its usual pallor to bright red!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was asleep upon his chair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all retired, and sank into the deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And helpless imbecility of sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They slept until the dawn of day drew near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the cock should have crowed, but did not crow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they had slain the shining chanticleer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eaten him for supper, as you know.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk was up betimes and of good cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, having breakfasted, made haste to go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he heard the distant matin bell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had but little time to say farewell.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh was the morning as the breath of kine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odors of herbs commingled with the sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balsamic exhalations of the pine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A haze was in the air presaging heat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprose the sun above the Apennine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the misty valleys at its feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were full of the delirious song of birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of men, and bells, and low of herds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this to Brother Timothy was naught;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care for scenery, nor here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His busy fancy found the thing it sought;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he saw the convent walls appear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smoke from kitchen chimneys upward caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whirled aloft into the atmosphere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickened his slow footsteps, like a beast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scents the stable a league off at least.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he entered though the convent gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw there in the court the ass, who stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twirling his ears about, and seemed to wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he found him waiting in the wood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told the Prior that, to alleviate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily labors of the brotherhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner, being a man of means and thrift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bestowed him on the convent as a gift.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereupon the Prior for many days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolved this serious matter in his mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned it over many different ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping that some safe issue he might find;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stood in fear of what the world would say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he accepted presents of this kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employing beasts of burden for the packs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lazy monks should carry on their backs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, to avoid all scandal of the sort,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stop the mouth of cavil, he decreed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he would cut the tedious matter short,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sell the ass with all convenient speed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus saving the expense of his support,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hoarding something for a time of need.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he despatched him to the neighboring Fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And freed himself from cumber and from care.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened now by chance, as some might say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others perhaps would call it destiny,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilbert was at the Fair; and heard a bray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nearer came, and saw that it was he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispered in his ear, "Ah, lackaday!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good father, the rebellious flesh, I see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has changed you back into an ass again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my admonitions were in vain."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ass, who felt this breathing in his ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not turn round to look, but shook his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he were not pleased these words to hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And contradicted all that had been said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this made Gilbert cry in voice more clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you well; your hair is russet-red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not deny it; for you are the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franciscan friar, and Timothy by name."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ass, though now the secret had come out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was obstinate, and shook his head again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a crowd was gathered round about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear this dialogue between the twain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And raised their voices in a noisy shout
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gilbert tried to make the matter plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flouted him and mocked him all day long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With laughter and with jibes and scraps of song.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this be Brother Timothy," they cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy him, and feed him on the tenderest grass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou canst not do too much for one so tried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to be twice transformed into an ass."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So simple Gilbert bought him, and untied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His halter, and o'er mountain and morass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He led him homeward, talking as he went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of good behavior and a mind content.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children saw them coming, and advanced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouting with joy, and hung about his neck,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Gilbert's, but the ass's,--round him danced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wove green garlands where-withal to deck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sacred person; for again it chanced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their childish feelings, without rein or check,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not discriminate in any way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A donkey from a friar of Orders Gray.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Brother Timothy," the children said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have come back to us just as before;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were afraid, and thought that you were dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we should never see you any more."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they kissed the white star on his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like a birth-mark or a badge he wore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And patted him upon the neck and face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said a thousand things with childish grace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thenceforward and forever he was known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Brother Timothy, and led alway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A life of luxury, till he had grown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ungrateful being stuffed with corn and hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very vicious.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in angry tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rousing himself, poor Gilbert said one day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When simple kindness is misunderstood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little flagellation may do good."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His many vices need not here be told;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them was a habit that he had
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flinging up his heels at young and old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking his halter, running off like mad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er pasture-lands and meadow, wood and wold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other misdemeanors quite as bad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But worst of all was breaking from his shed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, and ravaging the cabbage-bed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Brother Timothy went back once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his old life of labor and distress;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was beaten worse than he had been before.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, instead of comfort and caress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came labors manifold and trials sore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as his toils increased his food grew less,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last the great consoler, Death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ended his many sufferings with his breath.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great was the lamentation when he died;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mainly that he died impenitent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dame Cicely bewailed, the children cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man still remembered the event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the French war, and Gilbert magnified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His many virtues, as he came and went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "Heaven pardon Brother Timothy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep us from the sin of gluttony."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Signor Luigi," said the Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Sicilian's tale was told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The were-wolf is a legend old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the were-ass is something new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet for one I think it true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of wonder have not ceased
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are beasts in forms of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sure it happens now and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why may not man become a beast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In way of punishment at least?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this I will not now discuss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave the theme, that we may thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remain within the realm of song.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story that I told before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not acceptable to all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least you did not find too long.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg you, let me try again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With something in a different vein,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you bid the curtain fall.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile keep watch upon the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor let the Landlord leave his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest he should vanish into air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus elude our search once more."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus saying, from his lips he blew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little cloud of perfumed breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, as if it were a clew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead his footsteps safely through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Began his tale as followeth.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-night I'll have my friar, let me think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About my room, I'll have it in the pink;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be rich and sombre, and the moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in its mid-life in the midst of June,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should look thro' four large windows and display
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear, but for gold-fish vases in the way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their glassy diamonding on Turkish floor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tapers keep aside, an hour and more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see what else the moon alone can show;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the night-breeze doth softly let us know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My terrace is well bower'd with oranges.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the floor the dullest spirit sees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guitar-ribband and a lady's glove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside a crumple-leaved tale of love;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tambour-frame, with Venus sleeping there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All finish'd but some ringlets of her hair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A viol, bow-strings torn, cross-wise upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glorious folio of Anacreon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skull upon a mat of roses lying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ink'd purple with a song concerning dying;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour-glass on the turn, amid the trails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of passion-flower; just in time there sails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cloud across the moon, the lights bring in!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see what more my phantasy can win.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a gorgeous room, but somewhat sad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The draperies are so, as tho' they had
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Been made for Cleopatra's winding-sheet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And opposite the stedfast eye doth meet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spacious looking-glass, upon whose face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In letters raven-sombre, you may trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old "Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek busts and statuary have ever been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held, by the finest spirits, fitter far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than vase grotesque and Siamesian jar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore 'tis sure a want of Attic taste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should rather love a Gothic waste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of eyesight on cinque-coloured potter's clay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than on the marble fairness of old Greece.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My table-coverlits of Jason's fleece
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And black Numidian sheep-wool should be wrought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold, black, and heavy, from the Lama brought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ebon sofas should delicious be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With down from Leda's cygnet progeny.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pictures all Salvator's, save a few
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Titian's portraiture, and one, though new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Haydon's in its fresh magnificence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wine, O good! 'tis here at my desire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I must sit to supper with my friar.

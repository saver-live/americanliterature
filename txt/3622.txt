&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lad came to the door at night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lovers crown their vows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whistled soft and out of sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shadow of the boughs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I shall not vex you with my face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, my love, for aye;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So take me in your arms a space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the east is grey."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I from hence away am past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not find a bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shall be the first and last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ever lay beside."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard and went and knew not why;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her heart to his she laid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light was the air beneath the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dark under the shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems not to rise and fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here upon my bosom prest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There beats no heart at all?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have felt it then;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since for you I stopped the clock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It never goes again."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet from your neck on mine?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it falling on my lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lad, that tastes of brine?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when the knife has slit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throat across from ear to ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twill bleed because of it."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the stars the air was light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dark below the boughs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The still air of the speechless night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lovers crown their vows.

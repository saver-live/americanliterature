<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the path of the outmost sun through utter darkness hurled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther than ever comet flared or vagrant star-dust swirled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live such as fought and- sailed and ruled and loved and made our world.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are purged of pride because they died, they know the worth of their bays;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sit at wine with the Maidens Nine and the Gods of the Elder Days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is their will to serve or be still as fitteth Our Fathers praise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis theirs to sweep through the ringing deep where Azraels outposts are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or buffet a path through the Pits red wrath when God goes out to war,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hang with the reckless Seraphim on the rein of a redmaned star.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They take their mirth in the joy of the Earth, they dare not grieve for her, pain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know of toil and the end of toil; they know Gods Law is plain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they whistle the Devil to make them sport who know that Sin is vain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oft-times cometh our wise Lord God, master of every trade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tells them tales of His daily toil, of Edens newly made;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they rise to their feet as He passes by, gentlemen unafraid.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To these who are cleansed of base Desire, Sorrow and Lust and Shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods for they knew the hearts of men, men for they stooped to Fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne on the breath that men call Death, my brothers spirit came.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scarce had need to doff his pride or slough the dross of Earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Een as he trod that day to God so walked he from his birth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In simpleness and gentleness and honour and clean mirth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So cup to lip in fellowship they gave him welcome high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made him place at the banquet board, the Strong Men ranged thereby,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had done his work and held his peace and had no fear to die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the loom of the last lone star, through open darkness hurled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further than rebel comet dared or hiving star-swarm swirled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sits he with those that praise our God for that they served His world.

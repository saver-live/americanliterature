<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small, busy flames play through the fresh laid coals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like whispers of the household gods that keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle empire o'er fraternal souls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while, for rhymes, I search around the poles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your eyes are fix d, as in poetic sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the lore so voluble and deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That aye at fall of night our care condoles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is your birth-day Tom, and I rejoice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thus it passes smoothly, quietly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many such eves of gently whisp'ring noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May we together pass, and calmly try
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are this world s true joys, ere the great voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its fair face, shall bid our spirits fly.

<p>Oscar Wilde published his play, <cite class="al-title">An Ideal Husband</cite> in 1893, comprised of one 24 hour period. It premiered at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in London on January 3, 1895, but after 127 performances, Wilde's name was removed from the marque and the play closed after his arrest for "gross indecency." <i>"Sooner or later, we shall all have to pay for what we do,"</i> Wilde observed, a statement just as true for the play as for the author himself. Both <a href="/author/oscar-wilde/play/the-importance-of-being-earnest/summary">The Importance of Being Earnest</a> and <a href="summary">An Ideal Husband</a> are considered his dramatic masterworks.</p><p><a href="the-persons-of-the-play">The Persons of the Play</a></p><p><a href="the-scenes-of-the-play">The Scenes of the Play</a></p><p><a href="first-act">First Act</a></p><p><a href="second-act">Second Act</a></p><p><a href="third-act">Third Act</a></p><p><a href="fourth-act">Fourth Act</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/oscar-wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> library. </p>

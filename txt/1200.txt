I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was he doing, the great god Pan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in the reeds by the river ?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading ruin and scattering ban,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breaking the golden lilies afloat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dragon-fly on the river.

II.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore out a reed, the great god Pan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the deep cool bed of the river :
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limpid water turbidly ran,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the broken lilies a-dying lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dragon-fly had fled away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he brought it out of the river.

III.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High on the shore sate the great god Pan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While turbidly flowed the river ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hacked and hewed as a great god can,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till there was not a sign of a leaf indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove it fresh from the river.

IV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cut it short, did the great god Pan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(How tall it stood in the river !)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steadily from the outside ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And notched the poor dry empty thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In holes, as he sate by the river.

V.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way,' laughed the great god Pan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed while he sate by the river,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way, since gods began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sweet music, they could succeed.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blew in power by the river.

VI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan !
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piercing sweet by the river !
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinding sweet, O great god Pan !
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun on the hill forgot to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came back to dream on the river.

VII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To laugh as he sits by the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a poet out of a man :
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true gods sigh for the cost and pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reed which grows nevermore again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a reed with the reeds in the river.

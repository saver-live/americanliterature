<p>WHEN by thy scorn, O murd'ress, I am dead,<br> And that thou thinkst thee free<br> From all solicitation from me,<br> Then shall my ghost come to thy bed,<br> And thee, feign'd vestal, in worse arms shall see:<br> Then thy sick taper will begin to wink,<br> And he, whose thou art then, being tired before,<br> Will, if thou stir, or pinch to wake him, think<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou call'st for more,<br> And, in false sleep, will from thee shrink:<br> And then, poor aspen wretch, neglected thou<br> Bathed in a cold quicksilver sweat wilt lie,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A verier ghost than I.<br> What I will say, I will not tell thee now,<br> Lest that preserve thee; and since my love is spent,<br> I'd rather thou shouldst painfully repent,<br> Than by my threatenings rest still innocent.</p>

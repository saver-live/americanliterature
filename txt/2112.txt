<p>I LONG to talk with some old lover's ghost,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Who died before the god of love was born.<br> I cannot think that he, who then loved most,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.<br> But since this god produced a destiny,<br> And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>I must love her that loves not me.<br> <br> Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Nor he in his young godhead practised it.<br> But when an even flame two hearts did touch,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>His office was indulgently to fit<br> Actives to passives. Correspondency<br> Only his subject was; it cannot be<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Love, till I love her, who loves me.<br> <br> But every modern god will now extend<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>His vast prerogative as far as Jove.<br> To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>All is the purlieu of the god of love.<br> O! were we waken'd by this tyranny<br> To ungod this child again, it could not be<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>I should love her, who loves not me.<br> <br> Rebel and atheist too, why murmur I,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>As though I felt the worst that love could do?<br> Love might make me leave loving, or might try<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>A deeper plague, to make her love me too;<br> Which, since she loves before, I'm loth to see.<br> Falsehood is worse than hate; and that must be,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>If she whom I love, should love me.</p>

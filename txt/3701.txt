<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chestnut casts his flambeaux, and the flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stream from the hawthorn on the wind away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors clap to, the pane is blind with showers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass me the can, lad; theres an end of May.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theres one spoilt spring to scant our mortal lot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One season ruined of our little store.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May will be fine next year as like as not:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh ay, but then we shall be twenty-four.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We for a certainty are not the first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have sat in taverns while the tempest hurled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hopeful plans to emptiness, and cursed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever brute and blackguard made the world.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in truth iniquity on high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cheat our sentenced souls of aught they crave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mar the merriment as you and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fare on our long fools-errand to the grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iniquity it is; but pass the can.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lad, no pair of kings our mothers bore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our only portion is the estate of man:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want the moon, but we shall get no more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If here to-day the cloud of thunder lours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow it will hie on far behests;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh will grieve on other bones than ours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, and the soul will mourn in other breasts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubles of our proud and angry dust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are from eternity, and shall not fail.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear them we can, and if we can we must.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoulder the sky, my lad, and drink your ale.

<p>Since yesterday had to throw me and bolt,<br> Today has hurt my heart even more.<br> The autumn wild geese have a long wind for escort<br> As I face them from this villa, drinking my wine.<br> The bones of great writers are your brushes, in the School of Heaven,<br> And I am a Lesser Xie growing up by your side.<br> We both are exalted to distant thought,<br> Aspiring to the sky and the bright moon.<br> But since water still flows, though we cut it with our swords,<br> And sorrows return, though we drown them with wine,<br> Since the world can in no way answer our craving,<br> I will loosen my hair tomorrow and take to a fishing boat. <br></p>

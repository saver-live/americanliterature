<p>There I saw out<br> My twenty-first year,<br> Sweet in the mouth<br> The dark, sultry honey.<br> <br> On the twigs I tore<br> My white silk dress,<br> In the bowed pine,<br> The nightingale never rested.<br> <br> At the cry of convention,<br> It flies from its perch,<br> Like a woodland spirit,<br> Like a tender sister.<br> <br> Swiftly climbing the hill,<br> Swimming over the river,<br> Yes, and later,<br> Don't tell: leave me be.<br></p>

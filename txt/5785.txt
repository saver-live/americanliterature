<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft I remember those whom I have known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other days, to whom my heart was led
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As by a magnet, and who are not dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But absent, and their memories overgrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With other thoughts and troubles of my own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As graves with grasses are, and at their head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone with moss and lichens so o'erspread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is legible but the name alone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is it so with them?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After long years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they remember me in the same way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is the memory pleasant as to me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear to ask; yet wherefore are my fears?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasures, like flowers, may wither and decay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the root perennial may be.

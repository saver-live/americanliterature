&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! how I love, on a fair summer's eve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When streams of light pour down the golden west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the balmy zephyrs tranquil rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver clouds, far, far away to leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All meaner thoughts, and take a sweet reprieve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From little cares; to find, with easy quest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fragrant wild, with Nature's beauty drest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there into delight my soul deceive.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There warm my breast with patriotic lore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musing on Milton's fate, on Sydney's bier,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till their stern forms before my mind arise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps on wing of Poesy upsoar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full often dropping a delicious tear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some melodious sorrow spells mine eyes.

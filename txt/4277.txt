<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Aladdin magian
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever such a work began;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the wizard of the Dee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever such a dream could see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not St. John, in Patmos' Isle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the passion of his toil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw the churches seven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden aisl'd, built up in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaz'd at such a rugged wonder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stood its roofing under
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! I saw one sleeping there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the marble cold and bare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the surges wash'd his feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his garments white did beat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drench'd about the sombre rocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his neck his well-grown locks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted dry above the main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were upon the curl again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this? and what art thou?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whisper'd I, and touch'd his brow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What art thou? and what is this?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whisper'd I, and strove to kiss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit's hand, to wake his eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up he started in a trice:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Lycidas," said he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fam'd in funeral minstrely!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was architectur'd thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the great Oceanus!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here his mighty waters play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hollow organs all the day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here by turns his dolphins all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finny palmers great and small,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to pay devotion due
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each a mouth of pearls must strew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a mortal of these days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dares to pass our sacred ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dares to touch audaciously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Cathedral of the Sea!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been the pontiff-priest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the waters never rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a fledgy sea-bird choir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soars for ever; holy fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have hid from mortal man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proteus is my Sacristan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dulled eye of mortal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath pass'd beyond the rocky portal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for ever will I leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a taint, and soon unweave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic of the place."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- - - - - - -
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, with a Spirit's glance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dived!

Thine eyes blue tenderness, thy long fair hair,
﻿And the wan lustre of thy features—caught
﻿From contemplation—where serenely wrought,
Seems Sorrow's softness charm'd from its despair—
Have thrown such speaking sadness in thine air,
﻿That—but I know thy blessed bosom fraught
﻿With mines of unalloy'd and stainless thought—
I should have deem'd thee doom'd to earthly care.
With such an aspect by his colours blent,
﻿When from his beauty-breathing pencil born,
(Except that thou hast nothing to repent)
﻿The Magdalen of Guido saw the morn—
Such seem'st thou—but how much more excellent!
﻿With nought Remorse can claim—nor Virtue scorn.

<p>I've written down the words<br> That I've not dared to speak.<br> My body's strangely dumb.<br> Dully my head beats.<br> <br> The horn cries have died.<br> The heart's still confused.<br> On the croquet lawn, light<br> Autumn snowflakes fused.<br> <br> Let the last leaves rustle!<br> Let last thoughts torment!<br> I don't wish to trouble<br> Those used to happiness.<br> <br> Iforgive those lips, eyes<br> Of yours, their cruel jestâ€¦<br> Oh, tomorrow we'll ride<br> That first wintry sledge.<br> <br> Drawing-room candles will glow<br> More tenderly in the day.<br> Of conservatory roses,<br> I'll bring a whole bouquet.<br></p>

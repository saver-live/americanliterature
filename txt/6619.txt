<p>It was autumn in London, that blessed season between the harshness of winter and the insincerities of summer; a trustful season when one buys bulbs and sees to the registration of one's vote, believing perpetually in spring and a change of Government.</p><p> Morton Crosby sat on a bench in a secluded corner of Hyde Park, lazily enjoying a cigarette and watching the slow grazing promenade of a pair of snow-geese, the male looking rather like an albino edition of the russet-hued female. Out of the corner of his eye Crosby also noted with some interest the hesitating hoverings of a human figure, which had passed and repassed his seat two or three times at shortening intervals, like a wary crow about to alight near some possibly edible morsel. Inevitably the figure came to an anchorage on the bench, within easy talking distance of its original occupant. The uncared-for clothes, the aggressive, grizzled beard, and the furtive, evasive eye of the new-comer bespoke the professional cadger, the man who would undergo hours of humiliating tale-spinning and rebuff rather than adventure on half a day's decent work.</p><p> For a while the new-comer fixed his eyes straight in front of him in a strenuous, unseeing gaze; then his voice broke out with the insinuating inflection of one who has a story to retail well worth any loiterer's while to listen to.</p><p> "It's a strange world," he said.</p><p> As the statement met with no response he altered it to the form of a question.</p><p> "I daresay you've found it to be a strange world, mister?"</p><p> "As far as I am concerned," said Crosby, "the strangeness has worn off in the course of thirty-six years."</p><p> "Ah," said the greybeard, "I could tell you things that you'd hardly believe. Marvellous things that have really happened to me."</p><p> "Nowadays there is no demand for marvellous things that have really happened," said Crosby discouragingly; "the professional writers of fiction turn these things out so much better. For instance, my neighbours tell me wonderful, incredible things that their Aberdeens and chows and borzois have done; I never listen to them. On the other hand, I have read 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' three times."</p><p> The greybeard moved uneasily in his seat; then he opened up new country.</p><p> "I take it that you are a professing Christian," he observed.</p><p> "I am a prominent and I think I may say an influential member of the Mussulman community of Eastern Persia," said Crosby, making an excursion himself into the realms of fiction.</p><p> The greybeard was obviously disconcerted at this new check to introductory conversation, but the defeat was only momentary.</p><p> "Persia. I should never have taken you for a Persian," he remarked, with a somewhat aggrieved air.</p><p> "I am not," said Crosby; "my father was an Afghan."</p><p> "An Afghan!" said the other, smitten into bewildered silence for a moment. Then he recovered himself and renewed his attack.</p><p> "Afghanistan. Ah! We've had some wars with that country; now, I daresay, instead of fighting it we might have learned something from it. A very wealthy country, I believe. No real poverty there."</p><p> He raised his voice on the word "poverty" with a suggestion of intense feeling. Crosby saw the opening and avoided it.</p><p> "It possesses, nevertheless, a number of highly talented and ingenious beggars," he said; "if I had not spoken so disparagingly of marvellous things that have really happened I would tell you the story of Ibrahim and the eleven camel-loads of blotting-paper. Also I have forgotten exactly how it ended."</p><p> "My own life-story is a curious one," said the stranger, apparently stifling all desire to hear the history of Ibrahim; "I was not always as you see me now."</p><p> "We are supposed to undergo complete change in the course of every seven years," said Crosby, as an explanation of the foregoing announcement.</p><p> "I mean I was not always in such distressing circumstances as I am at present," pursued the stranger doggedly.</p><p> "That sounds rather rude," said Crosby stiffly, "considering that you are at present talking to a man reputed to be one of the most gifted conversationalists of the Afghan border."</p><p> "I don't mean in that way," said the greybeard hastily; "I've been very much interested in your conversation. I was alluding to my unfortunate financial situation. You mayn't hardly believe it, but at the present moment I am absolutely without a farthing. Don't see any prospect of getting any money, either, for the next few days. I don't suppose you've ever found yourself in such a position," he added.</p><p> "In the town of Yom," said Crosby, "which is in Southern Afghanistan, and which also happens to be my birthplace, there was a Chinese philosopher who used to say that one of the three chiefest human blessings was to be absolutely without money. I forget what the other two were."</p><p> "Ah, I daresay," said the stranger, in a tone that betrayed no enthusiasm for the philosopher's memory; "and did he practise what he preached? That's the test."</p><p> "He lived happily with very little money or resources," said Crosby.</p><p> "Then I expect he had friends who would help him liberally whenever he was in difficulties, such as I am in at present."</p><p> "In Yom," said Crosby, "it is not necessary to have friends in order to obtain help. Any citizen of Yom would help a stranger as a matter of course."</p><p> The greybeard was now genuinely interested.</p><p> The conversation had at last taken a favourable turn.</p><p> "If someone, like me, for instance, who was in undeserved difficulties, asked a citizen of that town you speak of for a small loan to tide over a few days' impecuniosity - five shillings, or perhaps a rather larger sum - would it be given to him as a matter of course?"</p><p> "There would be a certain preliminary," said Crosby; "one would take him to a wine-shop and treat him to a measure of wine, and then, after a little high-flown conversation, one would put the desired sum in his hand and wish him good-day. It is a roundabout way of performing a simple transaction, but in the East all ways are roundabout."</p><p> The listener's eyes were glittering.</p><p> "Ah," he exclaimed, with a thin sneer ringing meaningly through his words, "I suppose you've given up all those generous customs since you left your town. Don't practise them now, I expect."</p><p> "No one who has lived in Yom," said Crosby fervently, "and remembers its green hills covered with apricot and almond trees, and the cold water that rushes down like a caress from the upland snows and dashes under the little wooden bridges, no one who remembers these things and treasures the memory of them would ever give up a single one of its unwritten laws and customs. To me they are as binding as though I still lived in that hallowed home of my youth."</p><p> "Then if I was to ask you for a small loan - " began the greybeard fawningly, edging nearer on the seat and hurriedly wondering how large he might safely make his request, "if I was to ask you for, say - "</p><p> "At any other time, certainly," said Crosby; "in the months of November and December, however, it is absolutely forbidden for anyone of our race to give or receive loans or gifts; in fact, one does not willingly speak of them. It is considered unlucky. We will therefore close this discussion."</p><p> "But it is still October!" exclaimed the adventurer with an eager, angry whine, as Crosby rose from his seat; "wants eight days to the end of the month!"</p><p> "The Afghan November began yesterday," said Crosby severely, and in another moment he was striding across the Park, leaving his recent companion scowling and muttering furiously on the seat.</p><p> "I don't believe a word of his story," he chattered to himself; "pack of nasty lies from beginning to end. Wish I'd told him so to his face. Calling himself an Afghan!"</p><p> The snorts and snarls that escaped from him for the next quarter of an hour went far to support the truth of the old saying that two of a trade never agree. </p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

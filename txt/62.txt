<p>A Cat was growing very thin. As you have guessed, he did not get enough to eat. One day he heard that some Birds in the neighborhood were ailing and needed a doctor. So he put on a pair of spectacles, and with a leather box in his hand, knocked at the door of the Bird's home.</p><p>The Birds peeped out, and Dr. Cat, with much solicitude, asked how they were. He would be very happy to give them some medicine.</p><p>"Tweet, tweet," laughed the Birds. "Very smart, aren't you? We are very well, thank you, and more so, if <i>you</i> only keep away from here."</p><p class="center"><i>Be wise and shun the quack.</i></p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

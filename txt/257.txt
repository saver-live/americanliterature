<p>No one sung about that meeting,<br> Sadness faded with never a song.<br> A cool summer it was,<br> Like a new life begun.<br> <br> The sky seems a vault of stone,<br> Wounded by yellow fire,<br> And more than my daily bread<br> I need some word of him.<br> <br> Dew-wet grass<br> Refresh my soul with news â€“<br> Not for passion, or for pleasure,<br> But for deep love of this earth.<br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As unto the bow the cord is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unto the man is woman;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though she bends him, she obeys him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though she draws him, yet she follows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Useless each without the other!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the youthful Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said within himself and pondered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much perplexed by various feelings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listless, longing, hoping, fearing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreaming still of Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lovely Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wed a maiden of your people,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning said the old Nokomis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go not eastward, go not westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a stranger, whom we know not!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a fire upon the hearth-stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a neighbor's homely daughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the starlight or the moonlight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the handsomest of strangers!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus dissuading spake Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my Hiawatha answered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this: "Dear old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very pleasant is the firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I like the starlight better,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better do I like the moonlight!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravely then said old Nokomis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring not here an idle maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring not here a useless woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands unskilful, feet unwilling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring a wife with nimble fingers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart and hand that move together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feet that run on willing errands!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling answered Hiawatha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the land of the Dacotahs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives the Arrow-maker's daughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnehaha, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsomest of all the women.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will bring her to your wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shall run upon your errands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be the sunlight of my people!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still dissuading said Nokomis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring not to my lodge a stranger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the Dacotahs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very fierce are the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often is there war between us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are feuds yet unforgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounds that ache and still may open!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing answered Hiawatha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For that reason, if no other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would I wed the fair Dacotah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That our tribes might be united,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That old feuds might be forgotten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And old wounds be healed forever!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus departed Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of handsome women;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Striding over moor and meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through interminable forests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through uninterrupted silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his moccasins of magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each stride a mile he measured;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the way seemed long before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heart outran his footsteps;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he journeyed without resting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he heard the cataract's laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling to him through the silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pleasant is the sound!" he murmured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pleasant is the voice that calls me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outskirts of the forests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herds of fallow deer were feeding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they saw not Hiawatha;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his bow he whispered, "Fail not!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his arrow whispered, "Swerve not!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent it singing on its errand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the red heart of the roebuck;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw the deer across his shoulder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sped forward without pausing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of his wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the ancient Arrow-maker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making arrow-heads of jasper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrow-heads of chalcedony.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his side, in all her beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the lovely Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat his daughter, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaiting mats of flags and rushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the past the old man's thoughts were,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maiden's of the future.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thinking, as he sat there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the days when with such arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had struck the deer and bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Muskoday, the meadow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot the wild goose, flying southward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wing, the clamorous Wawa;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the great war-parties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they came to buy his arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not fight without his arrows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, no more such noble warriors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could be found on earth as they were!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the men were all like women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only used their tongues for weapons!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was thinking of a hunter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From another tribe and country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young and tall and very handsome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who one morning, in the Spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to buy her father's arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat and rested in the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingered long about the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back as he departed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had heard her father praise him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise his courage and his wisdom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he come again for arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Falls of Minnehaha?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mat her hands lay idle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her eyes were very dreamy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through their thoughts they heard a footstep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard a rustling in the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with glowing cheek and forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the deer upon his shoulders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly from out the woodlands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha stood before them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight the ancient Arrow-maker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked up gravely from his labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid aside the unfinished arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade him enter at the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, as he rose to meet him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Hiawatha, you are welcome!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feet of Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha laid his burden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw the red deer from his shoulders;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maiden looked up at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked up from her mat of rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said with gentle look and accent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are welcome, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very spacious was the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of deer-skins dressed and whitened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Gods of the Dacotahs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn and painted on its curtains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so tall the doorway, hardly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha stooped to enter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly touched his eagle-feathers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he entered at the doorway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then uprose the Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ground fair Minnehaha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid aside her mat unfinished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought forth food and set before them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water brought them from the brooklet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave them food in earthen vessels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened while the guest was speaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened while her father answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not once her lips she opened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a single word she uttered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, as in a dream she listened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the words of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he talked of old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had nursed him in his childhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he told of his companions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chibiabos, the musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of happiness and plenty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Ojibways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant land and peaceful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After many years of warfare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years of strife and bloodshed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is peace between the Ojibways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tribe of the Dacotahs."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus continued Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then added, speaking slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this peace may last forever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our hands be clasped more closely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our hearts be more united,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me as my wife this maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnehaha, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loveliest of Dacotah women!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ancient Arrow-maker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused a moment ere he answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoked a little while in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked at Hiawatha proudly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fondly looked at Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made answer very gravely:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, if Minnehaha wishes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lovely Laughing Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed more lovely as she stood there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither willing nor reluctant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she went to Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly took the seat beside him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she said, and blushed to say it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will follow you, my husband!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was Hiawatha's wooing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was he won the daughter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the ancient Arrow-maker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wigwam he departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading with him Laughing Water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand in hand they went together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the woodland and the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left the old man standing lonely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling to them from the distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying to them from afar off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ancient Arrow-maker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned again unto his labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat down by his sunny doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmuring to himself, and saying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus it is our daughters leave us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those we love, and those who love us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when they have learned to help us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are old and lean upon them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes a youth with flaunting feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his flute of reeds, a stranger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanders piping through the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckons to the fairest maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she follows where he leads her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving all things for the stranger!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant was the journey homeward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through interminable forests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over meadow, over mountain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over river, hill, and hollow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short it seemed to Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they journeyed very slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though his pace he checked and slackened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the steps of Laughing Water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over wide and rushing rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his arms he bore the maiden;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light he thought her as a feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the plume upon his head-gear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleared the tangled pathway for her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent aside the swaying branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made at night a lodge of branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a bed with boughs of hemlock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a fire before the doorway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dry cones of the pine-tree.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the travelling winds went with them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the meadows, through the forest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the stars of night looked at them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his ambush in the oak-tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched with eager eyes the lovers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rabbit, the Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scampered from the path before them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peering, peeping from his burrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat erect upon his haunches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched with curious eyes the lovers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant was the journey homeward!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the birds sang loud and sweetly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs of happiness and heart's-ease;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy are you, Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having such a wife to love you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy are you, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having such a noble husband!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sky the sun benignant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked upon them through the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying to them, "O my children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is sunshine, hate is shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is checkered shade and sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule by love, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sky the moon looked at them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the lodge with mystic splendors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered to them, "O my children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day is restless, night is quiet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man imperious, woman feeble;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half is mine, although I follow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule by patience, Laughing Water!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was they journeyed homeward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was that Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the lodge of old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the moonlight, starlight, firelight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the sunshine of his people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnehaha, Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsomest of all the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Dacotahs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of handsome women.

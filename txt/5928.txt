<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow on, sweet river! like his verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lies beneath this sculptured hearse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor wait beside the churchyard wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him who cannot hear thy call.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy playmate once; I see him now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boy with sunshine on his brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear in Stratford's quiet street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patter of his little feet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see him by thy shallow edge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wading knee-deep amid the sedge;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lost in thought, as if thy stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the swift river of a dream.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wonders whitherward it flows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fain would follow where it goes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the wide world, that shall erelong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be filled with his melodious song.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow on, fair stream!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dream is o'er;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stands upon another shore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vaster river near him flows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still he follows where it goes.

<p>Our Andy's gone to battle now<br> 'Gainst Drought, the red marauder;<br> Our Andy's gone with cattle now<br> Across the Queensland border.<br> <br> He's left us in dejection now,<br> Our thoughts with him are roving;<br> It's dull on this selection now,<br> Since Andy went a-droving.<br> <br> Who now shall wear the cheerful face<br> In times when things are slackest?<br> And who shall whistle round the place<br> When Fortune frowns her blackest?<br> <br> Oh, who shall cheek the squatter now<br> When he comes round us snarling?<br> His tongue is growing hotter now<br> Since Andy crossed the Darling.<br> <br> The gates are out of order now,<br> In storms the `riders' rattle;<br> For far across the border now<br> Our Andy's gone with cattle.<br> <br> Poor Aunty's looking thin and white;<br> And Uncle's cross with worry;<br> And poor old Blucher howls all night<br> Since Andy left Macquarie.<br> <br> Oh, may the showers in torrents fall,<br> And all the tanks run over;<br> And may the grass grow green and tall<br> In pathways of the drover;<br> <br> And may good angels send the rain<br> On desert stretches sandy;<br> And when the summer comes again<br> God grant 'twill bring us Andy.</p>

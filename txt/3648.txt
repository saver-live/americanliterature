<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairies break their dances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the printed lawn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And up from India glances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver sail of dawn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candles burn their sockets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blinds let through the day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man feels his pockets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wonders whatÂ’s to pay.

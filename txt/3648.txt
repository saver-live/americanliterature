<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it chance your eye offend you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluck it out, lad, and be sound:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twill hurt, but here are salves to friend you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a balsam grows on ground.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if your hand or foot offend you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut it off, lad, and be whole;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But play the man, stand up and end you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your sickness is your soul.

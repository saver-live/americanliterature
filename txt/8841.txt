<p>PURE form, that like some chalice of old time<br> Contain'st the liquid of the poet's thought<br> Within thy curving hollow, gem-enwrought<br> With interwoven traceries of rhyme,<br> While o'er thy brim the bubbling fancies climb,<br> What thing am I, that undismayed have sought<br> To pour my verse with trembling hand untaught<br> Into a shape so small yet so sublime?<br> Because perfection haunts the hearts of men,<br> Because thy sacred chalice gathered up<br> The wine of Petrarch, Shakspere, Shelley -- then<br> Receive these tears of failure as they drop<br> (Sole vintage of my life), since I am fain<br> To pour them in a consecrated cup.</p>

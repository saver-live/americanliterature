<p>The old gardens of Kusu Terrace<br> are a wilderness, yet the willows<br> that remain still put out new branches;<br> lasses gathering water chestnuts<br> sing so loudly and with such<br> clarity, that the feeling of spring<br> returns to us; but where once stood<br> the palace of the King of Wu, now<br> only the moon over the<br> west river once shone on<br> the lovely ladies there. <br></p>

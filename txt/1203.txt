<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To-day thou girdest up thy loins thyself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And goest where thou wouldest: presently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others shall gird thee," said the Lord, "to go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where thou wouldst not." He spoke to Peter thus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To signify the death which he should die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When crucified head downward.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If He spoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Peter then, He speaks to us the same;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word suits many different martyrdoms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And signifies a multiform of death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we scarcely die apostles, we,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have mislaid the keys of heaven and earth.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 'tis not in mere death that men die most,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, after our first girding of the loins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In youth's fine linen and fair broidery
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run up hill and meet the rising sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are apt to sit tired, patient as a fool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While others gird us with the violent bands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of social figments, feints, and formalisms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reversing our straight nature, lifting up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our base needs, keeping down our lofty thoughts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head downward on the cross-sticks of the world.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet He can pluck us from that shameful cross.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, set our feet low and our forehead high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show us how a man was made to walk!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave the lamp, Susan, and go up to bed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room does very well; I have to write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the stroke of midnight. Get away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your steps, for ever buzzing in the room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tease me like gnats. Ah, letters! throw them down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At once, as I must have them, to be sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether I bid you never bring me such
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At such an hour, or bid you. No excuse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You choose to bring them, as I choose perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To throw them in the fire. Now get to bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream, if possible, I am not cross.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why what a pettish, petty thing I grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mere mere woman, a mere flaccid nerve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kerchief left out all night in the rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned soft so, overtasked and overstrained
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And overlived in this close London life!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I should be stronger.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your letters, poor Aurora! for they stare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With red seals from the table, saying each,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here's something that you know not." Out, alas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis scarcely that the world's more good and wise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or even straighter and more consequent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since yesterday at this time yet, again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If but one angel spoke from Ararat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be very sorry not to hear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So open all the letters! let me read.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blanche Ord, the writer in the "Lady's Fan,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests my judgment on . . . that, afterwards.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate Ward desires the model of my cloak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And signs "Elisha to you." Pringle Sharpe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presents his work on "Social Conduct," craves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little money for his pressing debts . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From me, who scarce have money for my needs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art's fiery chariot which we journey in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being apt to singe our singing-robes to holes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you ask me for my cloak, Kate Ward!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's Rudgely knows it, editor and scribe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's "forced to marry where his heart is not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the purse lacks where he lost his heart."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, lost it because no one picked it up;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's really loss, (and passable impudence).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My critic Hammond flatters prettily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wants another volume like the last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My critic Belfair wants another book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entirely different, which will sell (and live?),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A striking book, yet not a startling book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public blames originalities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You must not pump spring-water unawares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a gracious public full of nerves):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good things, not subtle, new yet orthodox,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As easy reading as the dog-eared page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's fingered by said public fifty years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since first taught spelling by its grandmother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet a revelation in some sort:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's hard, my critic Belfair. So what next?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My critic Stokes objects to abstract thoughts;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call a man John, a woman Joan," says he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And do not prate so of humanities:"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat I call my critic simply, Stokes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My critic Jobson recommends more mirth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a cheerful genius suits the times,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all true poets laugh unquenchably
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Shakespeare and the gods. That's very hard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods may laugh, and Shakespeare; Dante smiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a needy heart on two pale lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cry "Weep rather, Dante." Poems are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men, if true poems: and who dares exclaim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any man's door, "Here, 'tis understood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder fell last week and killed a wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scared a sickly husband what of that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get up, be merry, shout and clap your hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a cheerful genius suits the times "?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None says so to the man, and why indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should any to the poem? A ninth seal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apocalypse is drawing to a close.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha, this from Vincent Carrington, "Dear friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want good counsel. Will you lend me wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise me to the subject, in a sketch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll bring to-morrow may I? at eleven?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poet's only born to turn to use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So save you! for the world . . . and Carrington."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(Writ after.) Have you heard of Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond what's said of him in newspapers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His phalansteries there, his speeches here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pamphlets, pleas, and statements, everywhere?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped me long ago, but no one drops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden apple though indeed one day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hinted that, but jested. Well, at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know Lord Howe who sees him . . . whom he sees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you see and I hate to see, for Howe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands high upon the brink of theories,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observes the swimmers and cries 'Very fine,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But keeps dry linen equally, unlike
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gallant breaster, Romney. Strange it is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such sudden madness seizing a young man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make earth over again, while I'm content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the pictures. Let me bring the sketch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tiptoe Danae, overbold and hot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both arms a-flame to meet her wishing Jove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halfway, and burn him faster down; the face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breasts upturned and straining, the loose locks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All glowing with the anticipated gold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or here's another on the self-same theme.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lies here flat upon her prison-floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long hair swathed about her to the heel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like wet seaweed. You dimly see her through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glittering haze of that prodigious rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half blotted out of nature by a love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As heavy as fate. I'll bring you either sketch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, myself, the second indicates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More passion."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely. Self is put away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And calm with abdication. She is Jove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no more Danae greater thus. Perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painter symbolises unaware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two states of the recipient artist-soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, forward, personal, wanting reverence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because aspiring only. We'll be calm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know that, when indeed our Joves come down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all turn stiller than we have ever been.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind Vincent Carrington. I'll let him come.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks of Florence, and may say a word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of something as it chanced seven years ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hedgehog in the path, or a lame bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those green country walks, in that good time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When certainly I was so miserable . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to have missed a blessing ever since.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music soars within the little lark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lark soars. It is not thus with men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not make our places with our strains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content, while they rise, to remain behind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone on earth instead of so in heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter; I bear on my broken tale.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Romney Leigh and I had parted thus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a chamber up three flights of stairs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from being as steep as some larks climb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, in a certain house in Kensington,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years I lived and worked. Get leave to work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world 'tis the best you get at all;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For God, in cursing, gives us better gifts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than men in benediction. God says, "Sweat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For foreheads," men say "crowns," and so we are crowned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, gashed by some tormenting circle of steel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which snaps with a secret spring. Get work, get work;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure 'tis better than what you work to get.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serene and unafraid of solitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked the short days out, and watched the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On lurid morns or monstrous afternoons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Like some Druidic idol's fiery brass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fixed unflickering outline of dead heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which the blood of wretches pent inside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems oozing forth to incarnadine the air)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Push out through fog with his dilated disk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And startle the slant roofs and chimney-pots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With splashes of fierce colour. Or I saw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fog only, the great tawny weltering fog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involve the passive city, strangle it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive, and draw it off into the void,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spires, bridges, streets, and squares, as if a sponge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had wiped out London, or as noon and night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had clapped together and utterly struck out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intermediate time, undoing themselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the act. Your city poets see such things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not despicable. Mountains of the south,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When drunk and mad with elemental wines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rend the seamless mist and stand up bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make fewer singers, haply. No one sings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending Sinai: on Parnassus mount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take a mule to climb and not a muse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in fable and figure: forests chant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their anthems to themselves, and leave you dumb.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sit in London at the day's decline,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And view the city perish in the mist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Pharaoh's armaments in the deep Red Sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chariots, horsemen, footmen, all the host,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucked down and choked to silence then, surprised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a sudden sense of vision and of tune,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You feel as conquerors though you did not fight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you and Israel's other singing girls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, Miriam with them, sing the song you choose.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked with patience, which means almost power:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did some excellent things indifferently,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some bad things excellently. Both were praised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter loudest. And by such a time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I myself had set them down as sins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce worth the price of sackcloth, week by week
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrived some letter through the sedulous post,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like these I've read, and yet dissimilar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pretty maiden seals, initials twined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lilies, or a heart marked Emily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Convicting Emily of being all heart);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rarer tokens from young bachelors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wrote from college with the same goose-quill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose, they had just been plucked of, and a snatch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Horace, "Collegisse juvat," set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the first page. Many a letter, signed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or unsigned, showing the writers at eighteen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had lived too long, although a muse should help
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their dawn by holding candles, compliments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To smile or sigh at. Such could pass with me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than coins from Moscow circulate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Paris: would ten roubles buy a tag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ribbon on the boulevard, worth a sou?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled that all this youth should love me, sighed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such a love could scarcely raise them up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To love what was more worthy than myself;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sighed again, again, less generously,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think the very love they lavished so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proved me inferior. The strong loved me not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he . . . my cousin Romney . . . did not write.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt the silent finger of his scorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prick every bubble of my frivolous fame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my breath blew it, and resolve it back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the air it came from. Oh, I justified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measure he had taken of my height:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing was plain he was not wrong a line;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I played at art, made thrusts with a toy-sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amused the lads and maidens.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came a sigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep, hoarse with resolution, I would work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better ends, or play in earnest. "Heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should be almost popular
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this went on!" I ripped my verses up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And found no blood upon the rapier's point;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart in them was just an embryo's heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which never yet had beat, that it should die;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just gasps of make-believe galvanic life;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere tones, inorganised to any tune.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I felt it in me where it burnt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like those hot fire-seeds of creation held
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jove's clenched palm before the worlds were sown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I I was not Juno even! my hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was shut in weak convulsion, woman's ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I yearned to loose a finger lo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nerve revolted. 'Tis the same even now:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hand may never, haply, open large,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the spark is quenched, or the palm charred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove the power not else than by the pain.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It burnt, it burns my whole life burnt with it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And light, not sunlight and not torchlight, flashed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My steps out through the slow and difficult road.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had grown distrustful of too forward Springs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The season's books in drear significance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of morals, dropping round me. Lively books?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash has livelier verdure than the yew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the yew's green longer, and alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found worthy of the holy Christmas time:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll plant more yews if possible, albeit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We plant the graveyards with them.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day and night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked my rhythmic thought, and furrowed up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both watch and slumber with long lines of life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which did not suit their season. The rose fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From either cheek, my eyes globed luminous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through orbits of blue shadow, and my pulse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would shudder along the purple-veinèd wrist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a shot bird. Youth's stern, set face to face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With youth's ideal: and when people came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said "You work too much, you are looking ill,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled for pity of them who pitied me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought I should be better soon perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those ill looks. Observe "I," means in youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just I, the conscious and eternal soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its ends, and not the outside life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parcel-man, the doublet of the flesh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so much liver, lung, integument,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which make the sum of "I" hereafter when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World-talkers talk of doing well or ill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prosper if I gain a step, although
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nail then pierced my foot: although my brain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embracing any truth froze paralysed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prosper: I but change my instrument;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I break the spade off, digging deep for gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch the mattock up.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked on, on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the bristling fence of nights and days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hedges time in from the eternities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I struggled, never stopped to note the stakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hurt me in my course. The midnight oil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would stink sometimes; there came some vulgar needs:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to live that therefore I might work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, being but poor, I was constrained, for life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To work with one hand for the booksellers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While working with the other for myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And art: you swim with feet as well as hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or make small way. I apprehended this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England no one lives by verse that lives;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, apprehending, I resolved by prose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a space to sphere my living verse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote for cyclopædias, magazines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weekly papers, holding up my name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep it from the mud. I learnt the use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the editorial "we" in a review
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As courtly ladies the fine trick of trains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swept it grandly through the open doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if one could not pass through doors at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save so encumbered. I wrote tales beside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carved many an article on cherry-stones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suit light readers, something in the lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revealing, it was said, the mallet-hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that, I'll never vouch for: what you do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For bread will taste of common grain, not grapes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you have a vineyard in Champagne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less in Nephelococcygia
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mine was, peradventure.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having bread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For just so many days, just breathing-room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For body and verse, I stood up straight and worked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My veritable work. And as the soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which grows within a child makes the child grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as the fiery sap, the touch from God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careering through a tree, dilates the bark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And roughs with scale and knob, before it strikes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer foliage out in a green flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So life, in deepening with me, deepened all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course I took, the work I did. Indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The academic law convinced of sin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critics cried out on the falling off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regretting the first manner. But I felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart's life throbbing in my verse to show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lived, it also certes incomplete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disordered with all Adam in the blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even its very tumours, warts and wens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still organised by and implying life.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lady called upon me on such a day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had the low voice of your English dames,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused, it seems, to need rise half a note
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch attention, and their quiet mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they lived too high above the earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that to put them out in anything:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So gentle, because verily so proud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wary and afraid of hurting you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By no means that you are not really vile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that they would not touch you with their foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To push you to your place; so self-possessed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet gracious and conciliating, it takes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effort in their presence to speak truth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the sort of woman, brilliant stuff,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of nature. "Lady Waldemar."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said her name quite simply, as if it meant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much indeed, but something, took my hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled as if her smile could help my case,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropped her eyes on me and let them melt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this," she said, "the Muse"?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No sybil even,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered, "since she fails to guess the cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which taxed you with this visit, madam."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said; "I value what's sincere at once.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if I had found a literal Muse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visit might have taxed me. As it is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wear your blue so chiefly in your eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fair Aurora, in a frank good way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comforts me entirely for your fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as for the trouble of ascent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this Olympus."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, a silver laugh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran rippling through her quickened little breaths
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steep stair somewhat justified.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ladyship has left me curious why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You dared the risk of finding the said Muse?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, keep me, notwithstanding, to the point,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any pedant? Is the blue in eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As awful as in stockings after all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder, that you'd have my business out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I breathe exact the epic plunge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of gasps? Well, naturally you think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've come here, as the lion-hunters go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deserts, to secure you with a trap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For exhibition in my drawing-rooms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On zoologic soirées? Not in the least.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roar softly at me; I am frivolous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare say; I have played at wild-beast shows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other women of my class, but now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I meet my lion simply as Androcles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met his . . . when at his mercy."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her head, as queens may mock, then lifting up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyelids with a real grave queenly look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ruled and would not spare, not even herself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think you have a cousin: Romney Leigh."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bring a word from him?" my eyes leapt up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the very height of hers, "a word from him?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bring a word about him, actually.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first" (she pressed me with her urgent eyes),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You do not love him, you?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're frank at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting questions, madam," I replied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love my cousin cousinly no more."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guessed as much. I'm ready to be frank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answering also, if you'll question me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or even for something less. You stand outside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You artist women, of the common sex;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You share not with us, and exceed us so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps by what you're mulcted in, your hearts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being starved to make your heads: so run the old
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditions of you. I can therefore speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the natural shame which creatures feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking on their level, to their like.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's many a papist she, would rather die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than own to her maid she put a ribbon on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch the indifferent eye of such a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who yet would count adulteries on her beads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At holy Mary's shrine and never blush;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the saints are so far off, we lose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All modesty before them. Thus, to-day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis I, love Romney Leigh."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forbear," I cried.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If here's no Muse, still less is any saint;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor even a friend, that Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should make confessions" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's unkindly said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no friend, what forbids to make a friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To join to our confession ere we have done?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love your cousin. If it seems unwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say so, it's still foolisher (we're frank)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel so. My first husband left me young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pretty enough, so please you, and rich enough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep my booth in Mayfair with the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To happy issues. There are marquises
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would serve seven years to call me wife, I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, after seven, I might consider it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there's some comfort in a marquisate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all's said, yes, but after the seven years;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, now, love Romney. You put up your lip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So like a Leigh! so like him! Pardon me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm well aware I do not derogate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In loving Romney Leigh. The name is good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The means are excellent, but the man, the man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven help us both, I am near as mad as he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In loving such an one."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly swung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her heavy ringlets till they touched her smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reasonably sorry for herself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus continued.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of a truth, Miss Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not, without struggle, come to this.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a master in the German tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gamed a little, went to Paris twice;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, after all, this love! . . . you eat of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do as vile a thing as if you ate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of garlic which, whatever else you eat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tastes uniformly acrid, till your peach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminds you of your onion. Am I coarse?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, love's coarse, nature's coarse ah, there's the rub.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fair fine ladies, who park out our lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From common sheep-paths, cannot help the crows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From flying over, we're as natural still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Blowsalinda. Drape us perfectly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lyons velvet, we are not, for that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay-figures, look you: we have hearts within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm, live, improvident, indecent hearts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ready for outrageous ends and acts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any distressed sempstress of them all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Romney groans and toils for. We catch love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other fevers, in the vulgar way:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love will not be outwitted by our wit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor outrun by our equipages: mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persisted, spite of efforts. All my cards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned up but Romney Leigh; my German stopped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At germane Wertherism; my Paris rounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returned me from the Champs Elysées just
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ghost, and sighing like Dido's. I came home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncured, convicted rather to myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of being in love . . . in love! That's coarse, you'll say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm talking garlic."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coldly I replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apologise for atheism, not love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I do believe in love, and God.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know my cousin: Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not: yet I say as much as this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever loves him, let her not excuse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cleanse herself, that, loving such a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She may not do it with such unworthy love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot stoop and take it."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austerely, like a youthful prophetess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knits her brows across her pretty eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep them back from following the grey flight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of doves between the temple-columns. Dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be kinder with me; let us two be friends.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a mere woman, the more weak perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through being so proud; you're better; as for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's best. Indeed he builds his goodness up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So high, it topples down to the other side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes a sort of badness; there's the worst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say against your cousin's best!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so be mild, Aurora, with my worst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his sake, if not mine."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I own myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incredulous of confidence like this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availing him or you."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I, myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of being worthy of him with any love:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your sense I am not so let it pass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I save him if I marry him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let that pass too."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pass, pass! we play police
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my cousin's life, to indicate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What may or may not pass?" I cried. "He knows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's worthy of him; the choice remains with him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what he chooses, act or wife, I think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not call unworthy, I, for one."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis somewhat rashly said," she answered slow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now let's talk reason, though we talk of love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your cousin Romney Leigh's a monster; there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word's out fairly, let me prove the fact.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll take, say, that most perfect of antiques
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They call the Genius of the Vatican
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Which seems too beauteous to endure itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this mixed world), and fasten it for once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the torso of the Dancing Faun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who might limp surely, if he did not dance),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of Buonarroti's mask: what then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We show the sort of monster Romney is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With godlike virtues and heroic aims
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subjoined to limping possibilities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mismade human nature. Grant the man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice godlike, twice heroic, still he limps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here's the point we come to."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pardon me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Lady Waldemar, the point's the thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never come to."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caustic, insolent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At need! I like you" (there, she took my hands)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now, my lioness, help Androcles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all your roaring. Help me! for myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not say so but for him. He limps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So certainly, he'll fall into the pit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week hence, so I lose him so he is lost!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when he's fairly married, he a Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a girl of doubtful life, undoubtful birth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starved out in London till her coarse-grained hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are whiter than her morals, even you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May call his choice unworthy."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Married! lost!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He . . . Romney!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, you're moved at last," she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These monsters, set out in the open sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course throw monstrous shadows: those who think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awry, will scarce act straightly. Who but he?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who but you can wonder? He has been mad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world knows, since first, a nominal man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He soured the proctors, tried the gowns-men's wits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With equal scorn of triangles and wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took no honours, yet was honourable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll tell you he lost count of Homer's ships
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Melbourne's poor-bills, Ashley's factory bills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignored the Aspasia we all dare to praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other women, dear, we could not name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we're decent. Well, he had some right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his side probably; men always have
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who go absurdly wrong. The living boor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who brews your ale exceeds in vital worth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead Cæsar who 'stops bungholes' in the cask;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also, to do good is excellent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For persons of his income, even to boors:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sympathise with all such things. But he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went mad upon them . . . madder and more mad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From college times to these, as, going down hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faster still, the farther. You must know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Leigh by heart: he has sown his black young curls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bleaching cares of half a million men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already. If you do not starve, or sin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're nothing to him: pay the income-tax
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And break your heart upon't, he'll scarce be touched;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But come upon the parish, qualified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the parish stocks, and Romney will be there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To call you brother, sister, or perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tenderer name still. Had I any chance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Mister Leigh, who am Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never committed felony?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too bitterly," I said, "for the literal truth."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth is bitter. Here's a man who looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever on the ground! you must be low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else a pictured ceiling overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good painting thrown away. For me, I've done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What women may we're somewhat limited,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We modest women but I've done my best.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How men are perjured when they swear our eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have meaning in them! they're just blue or brown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just can drop their lids a little. And yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine did more, for I read half Fourier through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proudhon, Considérant, and Louis Blanc,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With various others of his socialists,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if I had been a fathom less in love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had cured myself with gaping. As it was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quoted from them prettily enough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, to make them sound half rational
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a saner man than he whene'er we talked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For which I dodged occasion) learnt by heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His speeches in the Commons and elsewhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the social question; heaped reports
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wicked women and penitentiaries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all my tables (with a place for Sue),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave my name to swell subscription lists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward keeping up the sun at nights in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other possible ends. All things I did,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except the impossible . . . such as wearing gowns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided by the Ten Hours' movement: there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped we must stop somewhere. He, meanwhile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmoved as the Indian tortoise 'neath the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all that noise go on upon his back:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would not disconcert or throw me out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas well to see a woman of my class
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a dawn of conscience. For the heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made firewood for his sake, and flaming up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his face, he merely warmed his feet at it:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just deigned to let my carriage stop him short
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In park or street, he leaning on the door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With news of the committee which sat last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pickpockets at suck."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You jest you jest."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As martyrs jest, dear (if you read their lives),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the axe which kills them. When all's done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By me, . . . for him you'll ask him presently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colour of my hair he cannot tell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or answers 'dark' at random; while, be sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's absolute on the figure, five or ten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my last subscription. Is it bearable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I a woman?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it reparable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I were a man?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know not. That's to prove.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, first, this shameful marriage?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay?" I cried.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then really there's a marriage?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yesterday
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I held him fast upon it. 'Mister Leigh,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said I, 'shut up a thing, it makes more noise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The boiling town keeps secrets ill; I've known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yours since last week. Forgive my knowledge so:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You feel I'm not the woman of the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The world thinks; you have borne with me before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And used me in your noble work, our work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And now you shall not cast me off because
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You're at the difficult point, the join. 'Tis true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Even I can scarce admit the cogency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Of such a marriage . . . where you do not love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(Except the class), yet marry and throw your name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Down to the gutter, for a fire-escape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To future generations! 'tis sublime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A great example, a true Genesis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Of the opening social era. But take heed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This virtuous act must have a patent weight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Or loses half its virtue. Make it tell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Interpret it, and set it in the light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And do not muffle it in a winter-cloak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As a vulgar bit of shame, as if, at best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Leigh had made a misalliance and blushed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Howard should know it.' Then, I pressed him more:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He would not choose,' I said, 'that even his kin, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Aurora Leigh, even . . . should conceive his act
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Less sacrifice, more fantasy.' At which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grew so pale, dear, . . . to the lips, I knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had touched him. 'Do you know her,' he inquired,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My cousin Aurora?' 'Yes,' I said, and lied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(But truly we all know you by your books),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I offered to come straight to you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain the subject, justify the cause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take you with me to Saint Margaret's Court
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see this miracle, this Marian Erle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This drover's daughter (she's not pretty, he swears),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon whose finger, exquisitely pricked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a hundred needles, we're to hang the tie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt class and class in England, thus indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By such a presence, yours and mine, to lift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The match up from the doubtful place. At once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thanked me sighing, murmured to himself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'She'll do it perhaps, she's noble,' thanked me twice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And promised, as my guerdon, to put off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His marriage for a month."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered then.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand your drift imperfectly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wish to lead me to my cousin's betrothed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch her hand if worthy, and hold her hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If feeble, thus to justify his match.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So be it then. But how this serves your ends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how the strange confession of your love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serves this, I have to learn I cannot see."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knit her restless forehead. "Then, despite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora, that most radiant morning name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're dull as any London afternoon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted time, and gained it, wanted you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gain you! you will come and see the girl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whose most prodigal eyes the lineal pearl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pride of all your lofty race of Leighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is destined to solution. Authorised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sight and knowledge, then, you'll speak your mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prove to Romney, in your brilliant way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll wrong the people and posterity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Say such a thing is bad for me and you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you fail utterly), by concluding thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An execrable marriage. Break it up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disroot it peradventure presently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll plant a better fortune in its place.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be good to me, Aurora, scorn me less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For saying the thing I should not. Well I know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should not. I have kept, as others have,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron rule of womanly reserve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lip and life, till now: I wept a week
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I came here." Ending, she was pale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last words, haughtily said, were tremulous.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This palfrey pranced in harness, arched her neck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, only by the foam upon the bit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You saw she champed against it.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I rose.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love love: truth's no cleaner thing than love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I comprehend a love so fiery hot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It burns its natural veil of august shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stands sublimely in the nude, as chaste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Medicean Venus. But I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A love that burns through veils will burn through masks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shrivel up treachery. What, love and lie!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay go to the opera! your love's curable."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love and lie?" she said "I lie, forsooth?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beat her taper foot upon the floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled against the shoe, "You're hard, Miss Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unversed in current phrases. Bowling greens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of poets are fresher than the world's highways:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me that I rashly blew the dust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which dims our hedges even, in your eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vexed you so much. You find, probably,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No evil in this marriage, rather good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of innocence, to pastoralise in song:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll give the bond your signature, perhaps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the lady's mark, indifferent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Romney chose a wife could write her name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In witnessing he loved her."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Loved!" I cried;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who tells you that he wants a wife to love?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gets a horse to use, not love, I think:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's work for wives as well, and after, straw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When men are liberal. For myself, you err
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing power in me to break this match.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not do it to save Romney's life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would not to save mine."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You take it so,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, "farewell then. Write your books in peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as may be for some secret stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now obvious to me, for, most obviously,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In coming hither I mistook the way."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat she touched my hand and bent her head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And floated from me like a silent cloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves the sense of thunder.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drew breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oppressed in my deliverance. After all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman breaks her social system up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For love, so counted the love possible
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such, and lilies are still lilies, pulled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By smutty hands, though spotted from their white;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus she is better haply, of her kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Romney Leigh, who lives by diagrams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crosses out the spontaneities
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all his individual, personal life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With formal universals. As if man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were set upon a high stool at a desk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep God's books for Him in red and black,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel by millions! What, if even God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were chiefly God by living out Himself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To an individualism of the Infinite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eterne, intense, profuse, still throwing up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden spray of multitudinous worlds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In measure to the proclive weight and rush
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of His inner nature, the spontaneous love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still proof and outflow of spontaneous life?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then live, Aurora.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours afterward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within Saint Margaret's Court I stood alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close-veiled. A sick child, from an ague-fit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose wasted right hand gambled 'gainst his left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an old brass button in a blot of sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeered weakly at me as I passed across
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uneven pavement; while a woman, rouged
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the angular cheek-bones, kerchief torn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin dangling locks, and flat lascivious mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed at a window both ways, in and out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By turns some bed-rid creature and myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lie still there, mother! liker the dead dog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll be to-morrow. What, we pick our way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine madam, with those damnable small feet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cover up our face from doing good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it were our purse! What brings you here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lady? Is't to find my gentleman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who visits his tame pigeon in the eaves?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cholera catch you with its cramps and spasms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tumble up your good clothes, veil and all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turn your whiteness dead-blue." I looked up;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I could have walked through hell that day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never flinched. "The dear Christ comfort you,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "you must have been most miserable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be so cruel," and I emptied out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My purse upon the stones: when, as I had cast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last charm in the cauldron, the whole court
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went boiling, bubbling up, from all its doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And windows, with a hideous wail of laughs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And roar of oaths, and blows perhaps . . . I passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too quickly for distinguishing . . . and pushed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little side-door hanging on a hinge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plunged into the dark, and groped and climbed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long, steep, narrow stair 'twixt broken rail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mildewed wall that let the plaster drop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To startle me in the blackness. Still, up, up!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So high lived Romney's bride. I paused at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a low door in the roof, and knocked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came an answer like a hurried dove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So soon? can that be Mister Leigh? so soon?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as I entered, an ineffable face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met mine upon the threshold. "Oh, not you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not you!" the dropping of the voice implied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, if not you, for me not any one."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked her in the eyes, and held her hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said "I am his cousin, Romney Leigh's;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here I come to see my cousin too."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She touched me with her face and with her voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This daughter of the people. Such soft flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From such rough roots? The people, under there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can sin so, curse so, look so, smell so . . . faugh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet have such daughters?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowise beautiful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Marian Erle. She was not white nor brown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But could look either, like a mist that changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to being shone on more or less:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair, too, ran its opulence of curls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doubt 'twixt dark and bright, nor left you clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To name the colour. Too much hair perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I'll name a fault here) for so small a head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seemed to droop on that side and on this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a full-blown rose uneasy with its weight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not a wind should trouble it. Again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dimple in the cheek had better gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With redder, fuller rounds; and somewhat large
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth was, though the milky little teeth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolved it to so infantine a smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For soon it smiled at me; the eyes smiled too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 'twas as if remembering they had wept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knowing they should, some day, weep again.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked. She told me all her story out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which I'll re-tell with fuller utterance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As coloured and confirmed in after times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By others and herself too. Marian Erle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was born upon the ledge of Malvern Hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To eastward, in a hut built up at night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To evade the landlord's eye, of mud and turf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still liable, if once he looked that way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To being straight levelled, scattered by his foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any other anthill. Born, I say;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God sent her to His world, commissioned right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her human testimonials fully signed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not scant in soul complete in lineaments;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But others had to swindle her a place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wail in when she had come. No place for her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By man's law! born an outlaw was this babe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her first cry in our strange and strangling air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cast in spasms out by the shuddering womb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was wrong against the social code, forced wrong:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What business had the baby to cry there?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell her story and grow passionate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, Marian, did not tell it so, but used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meek words that made no wonder of herself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For being so sad a creature. "Mister Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Considered truly that such things should change.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will, in heaven but meantime, on the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's none can like a nettle as a pink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except himself. We're nettles, some of us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And give offence by the act of springing up;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, if we leave the damp side of the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hoes, of course, are on us." So she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father earned his life by random jobs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despised by steadier workmen keeping swine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On commons, picking hops, or hurrying on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest at wet seasons, or, at need,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisting the Welsh drovers, when a drove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of startled horses plunged into the mist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the mountain-road, and sowed the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wandering neighings. In between the gaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such irregular work he drank and slept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cursed his wife because, the pence being out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not buy more drink. At which she turned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The worm), and beat her baby in revenge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her own broken heart. There's not a crime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But takes its proper change out still in crime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If once rung on the counter of this world:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let sinners look to it.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the outcast child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whom the very mother's face forwent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's special patience, lived and grew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learnt early to cry low, and walk alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that pathetic vacillating roll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the infant body on the uncertain feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The earth being felt unstable ground so soon),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which most women's arms unclose at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With irrepressive instinct. Thus, at three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poor weaned kid would run off from the fold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This babe would steal off from the mother's chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, creeping through the golden walls of gorse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would find some keyhole toward the secresy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Heaven's high blue, and, nestling down, peer out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, not to catch the angels at their games,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had never heard of angels, but to gaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew not why, to see she knew not what,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-hungering outward from the barren earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For something like a joy. She liked, she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dazzle black her sight against the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For then, it seemed, some grand blind Love came down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And groped her out, and clasped her with a kiss;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She learnt God that way, and was beat for it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever she went home, yet came again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As surely as the trapped hare, getting free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns to his form. This grand blind Love, she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This skyey father and mother both in one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructed her and civilised her more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than even Sunday-school did afterward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which a lady sent her to learn books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sit upon a long bench in a row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With other children. Well, she laughed sometimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see them laugh and laugh and maul their texts;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ofter she was sorrowful with noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wondered if their mothers beat them hard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever they should laugh so. There was one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loved indeed, Rose Bell, a seven years' child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So pretty and clever, who read syllables
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Marian was at letters; she would laugh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nothing hold your finger up, she laughed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shook her curls down over eyes and mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hide her make-mirth from the school-master:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rose's pelting glee, as frank as rain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On cherry-blossoms, brightened Marian too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see another merry whom she loved.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered once (the children side by side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mutual arms entwined about their necks)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your mother lets you laugh so?" "Ay," said Rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She lets me. She was dug into the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years since, I being but a yearling wean.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such mothers let us play and lose our time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never scold nor beat us! Don't you wish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had one like that?" There, Marian breaking off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked suddenly in my face. "Poor Rose," said she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard her laugh last night in Oxford Street.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd pour out half my blood to stop that laugh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Rose, poor Rose!" said Marian.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She resumed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tried her, when she had learnt at Sunday-school
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What God was, what He wanted from us all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how in choosing sin we vexed the Christ,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go straight home and hear her father pull
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Name down on us from the thunder-shelf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then drink away his soul into the dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From seeing judgment. Father, mother, home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were God and heaven reversed to her: the more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew of Right, the more she guessed their wrong:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her price paid down for knowledge, was to know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vileness of her kindred: through her heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her filial and tormented heart, henceforth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They struck their blows at virtue. Oh, 'tis hard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn you have a father up in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a gathering certain sense of being, on earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still worse than orphaned: 'tis too heavy a grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The having to thank God for such a joy!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so passed Marian's life from year to year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her parents took her with them when they tramped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodged lanes and heaths, frequented towns and fairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once went farther and saw Manchester,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once the sea, that blue end of the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fair scroll-finis of a wicked book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twice a prison, back at intervals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the hills. Hills draw like heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stronger sometimes, holding out their hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pull you from the vile flats up to them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though perhaps these strollers still strolled back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sheep do, simply that they knew the way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly felt bettered unaware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerging from the social smut of towns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wipe their feet clean on the mountain turf.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which long wanderings, Marian lived and learned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endured and learned. The people on the roads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would stop and ask her why her eyes outgrew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cheeks, and if she meant to lodge the birds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all that hair; and then they lifted her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miller in his cart, a mile or twain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher's boy on horseback. Often too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedlar stopped, and tapped her on the head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With absolute forefinger, brown and ringed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And asked if peradventure she could read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when she answered "ay," would toss her down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some stray odd volume from his heavy pack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Thomson's Seasons, mulcted of the Spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or half a play of Shakespeare's, torn across
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(She had to guess the bottom of a page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By just the top sometimes, as difficult,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, sitting on the moon, to guess the earth!),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else a sheaf of leaves (for that small Ruth's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small gleanings) torn out from the heart of books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Churchyard Elegies and Edens Lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Burns, and Bunyan, Selkirk, and Tom Jones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas somewhat hard to keep the things distinct,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oft the jangling influence jarred the child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like looking at a sunset full of grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a pothouse window while the drunken oaths
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went on behind her. But she weeded out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her book-leaves, threw away the leaves that hurt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(First tore them small, that none should find a word),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a nosegay of the sweet and good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fold within her breast, and pore upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At broken moments of the noontide glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leave was given her to untie her cloak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rest upon the dusty highway's bank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the road's dust: or oft, the journey done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some city friend would lead her by the hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear a lecture at an institute.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus she had grown, this Marian Erle of ours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To no book-learning, she was ignorant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of authors, not in earshot of the things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outspoken o'er the heads of common men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By men who are uncommon, but within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cadenced hum of such, and capable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of catching from the fringes of the wing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fragmentary phrases, here and there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that fine music, which, being carried in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her soul, had reproduced itself afresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In finer motions of the lips and lids.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, in speaking of it, "If a flower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were thrown you out of heaven at intervals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd soon attain to a trick of looking up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so with her." She counted me her years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I felt old; and then she counted me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sorrowful pleasures, till I felt ashamed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me she was fortunate and calm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such and such a season, sat and sewed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no one to break up her crystal thoughts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While rhymes from lovely poems span around
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ringing circles of ecstatic tune,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the moistened finger of the Hour.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her parents called her a strange, sickly child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not good for much, and given to sulk and stare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smile into the hedges and the clouds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tremble if one shook her from her fit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By any blow, or word even. Out-door jobs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went ill with her, and household quiet work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was not born to. Had they kept the north,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might have had their pennyworth out of her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other parents, in the factories
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Your children work for you, not you for them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else they better had been choked with air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first breath drawn); but, in this tramping life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was nothing to be done with such a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tramp and tramp. And yet she knitted hose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not ill, and was not dull at needlework;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the country people gave her pence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For darning stockings past their natural age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And patching petticoats from old to new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other light work done for thrifty wives.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, said Marian the sun shone that day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother had been badly beat, and felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bruises sore about her wretched soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That must have been): she came in suddenly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And snatching in a sort of breathless rage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her daughter's headgear comb, let down the hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon her like a sudden waterfall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then drew her drenched and passive by the arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the hut they lived in. When the child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could clear her blinded face from all that stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tresses . . . there, a man stood, with beast's eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seemed as they would swallow her alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete in body and spirit, hair and all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burning stertorous breath that hurt her cheek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He breathed so near. The mother held her tight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying hard between her teeth "Why wench, why wench,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squire speaks to you now the squire's too good:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He means to set you up, and comfort us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be mannerly at least." The child turned round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked up piteous in the mother's face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Be sure that mother's death-bed will not want
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another devil to damn, than such a look),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, mother!" then, with desperate glance to heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, free me from my mother," she shrieked out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These mothers are too dreadful." And, with force
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As passionate as fear, she tore her hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like lilies from the rocks, from hers and his,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sprang down, bounded headlong down the steep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from both away, if possible,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as God, away! They yelled at her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As famished hounds at a hare. She heard them yell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt her name hiss after her from the hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like shot from guns. On, on. And now she had cast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices off with the uplands. On. Mad fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was running in her feet and killing the ground;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white roads curled as if she burnt them up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green fields melted, wayside trees fell back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make room for her. Then her head grew vexed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trees, fields, turned on her and ran after her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard the quick pants of the hills behind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their keen air pricked her neck: she had lost her feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could run no more, yet somehow went as fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horizon red 'twixt steeples in the east
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sucked her forward, forward, while her heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept swelling, swelling, till it swelled so big
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to fill her body, when it burst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And overflowed the world and swamped the light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now I am dead and safe," thought Marian Erle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had dropped, she had fainted.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sense returned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night had passed not life's night. She was 'ware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heavy tumbling motions, creaking wheels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver shouting to the lazy team
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That swung their rankling bells against her brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, through the waggon's coverture and chinks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruel yellow morning pecked at her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive or dead upon the straw inside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which her soul ached back into the dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prayed, "no more of that." A waggoner
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had found her in a ditch beneath the moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As white as moonshine save for the oozing blood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first he thought her dead; but when he had wiped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth and heard it sigh, he raised her up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid her in his waggon in the straw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so conveyed her to the distant town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which his business called himself, and left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That heap of misery at the hospital.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stirred; the place seemed new and strange as death.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white strait bed, with others strait and white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like graves dug side by side at measured lengths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quiet people walking in and out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wonderful low voices and soft steps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And apparitional equal care for each,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astonished her with order, silence, law.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when a gentle hand held out a cup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took it, as you do at sacrament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half awed, half melted, not being used, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To so much love as makes the form of love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And courtesy of manners. Delicate drinks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rare white bread, to which some dying eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were turned in observation. O my God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sick we must be, ere we make men just!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it frets the saints in heaven to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many desolate creatures on the earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have learnt the simple dues of fellowship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And social comfort, in a hospital,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Marian did. She lay there, stunned, half tranced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wished, at intervals of growing sense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She might be sicker yet, if sickness made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world so marvellous kind, the air so hushed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all her wake-time quiet as a sleep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now she understood (as such things were)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sickness ended very oft in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the unspoken raptures: yet more sick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And surelier happy. Then she dropped her lids,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, folding up her hands as flowers at night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would lose no moment of the blessed time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lay and seethed in fever many weeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But youth was strong and overcame the test;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolted soul and flesh were reconciled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fetched back to the necessary day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And daylight duties. She could creep about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long bare rooms, and stare out drearily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From any narrow window on the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till some one who had nursed her as a friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said coldly to her, as an enemy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She had leave to go next week, being well enough,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(While only her heart ached). "Go next week," thought she:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next week! how would it be with her next week,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let out into that terrible street alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the pushing people, . . . to go . . . where?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, the last before the dreaded last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the convalescents, like herself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared to go next morning, she sat dumb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard half absently the women talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How one was famished for her baby's cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The little wretch would know her! a year old
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lively, like his father!" one was keen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get to work, and fill some clamorous mouths;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was tender for her dear goodman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had missed her sorely, and one, querulous . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would pay backbiting neighbours who had dared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk about her as already dead,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was proud . . . "and if her sweetheart Luke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had left her for a ruddier face than hers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The gossip would be seen through at a glance),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet riddance of such sweethearts let him hang!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twere good to have been sick for such an end."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while they talked, and Marian felt the worse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For having missed the worst of all their wrongs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A visitor was ushered through the wards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And paused among the talkers. "When he looked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as if he spoke, and when he spoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sang perhaps," said Marian; "could she tell?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only knew" (so much she had chronicled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As seraphs might the making of the sun)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That he who came and spake was Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then and there she saw and heard him first."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when it was her turn to have the face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon her, all those buzzing pallid lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being satisfied with comfort when he changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Marian, saying "And you? you're going, where?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, moveless as a worm beneath a stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which some one's stumbling foot has spurned aside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writhed suddenly, astonished with the light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, breaking into sobs, cried "Where I go?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None asked me till this moment. Can I say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I go, when it has not seemed worth while
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To God Himself, who thinks of every one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think of me and fix where I shall go?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So young," he gently asked her, "you have lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your father and your mother?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both," she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both lost! my father was burnt up with gin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ever I sucked milk, and so is lost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother sold me to a man last month,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so my mother's lost, 'tis manifest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, who fled from her for miles and miles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I had caught sight of the fire of hell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through some wild gap (she was my mother, sir),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems I shall be lost too, presently,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we end, all three of us."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor child,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, with such a pity in his voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It soothed her more than her own tears, "poor child!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis simple that betrayal by mother's love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should bring despair of God's too. Yet be taught,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's better to us than many mothers are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And children cannot wander beyond reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sweep of his white raiment. Touch and hold!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you weep still, weep where John was laid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Jesus loved him."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She could say the words,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me, "exactly as he uttered them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year back, since in any doubt or dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came out like the stars, and shone on her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just their comfort. Common words, perhaps;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers in church might say the same;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he, he made the church with what he spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference was the miracle," said she.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then catching up her smile to ravishment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She added quickly, "I repeat his words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not his tones: can any one repeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of an organ, out of church?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he said 'poor child,' I shut my eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel how tenderly his voice broke through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ointment-box broke on the Holy feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let out the rich medicative nard."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me how he had raised and rescued her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reverent pity, as, in touching grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the wounds of Christ, and made her feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More self-respecting. Hope he called belief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In God, work, worship, therefore let us pray!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, to snatch her soul from atheism,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep it stainless from her mother's face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent her to a famous sempstress-house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off in London, there to work and hope.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, they parted. She kept sight of Heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not of Romney. He had good to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To others: through the days and through the nights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sewed and sewed and sewed. She drooped sometimes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wondered, while along the tawny light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struck the new thread into her needle's eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How people without mothers on the hills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could choose the town to live in! then she drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stitch, and mused how Romney's face would look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if 'twere likely he'd remember hers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they two had their meeting after death.

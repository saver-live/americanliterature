<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto whose use the pregnant suns are poised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With idiot moons and stars retracting stars?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creep thou between, thy coming's all unnoised.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven hath her high, as Earth her baser, wars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heir to these tumults, this affright, that fray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(By Adams, fathers, own, sin bound alway);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer up, draw out thy horoscope and say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which planet mends thy threadbare fate, or mars.

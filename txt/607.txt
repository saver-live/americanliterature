<p>Amongst the flowers I<br> am alone with my pot of wine<br> drinking by myself; then lifting<br> my cup I asked the moon<br> to drink with me, its reflection<br> and mine in the wine cup, just<br> the three of us; then I sigh<br> for the moon cannot drink,<br> and my shadow goes emptily along<br> with me never saying a word;<br> with no other friends here, I can<br> but use these two for company;<br> in the time of happiness, I<br> too must be happy with all<br> around me; I sit and sing<br> and it is as if the moon<br> accompanies me; then if I<br> dance, it is my shadow that<br> dances along with me; while<br> still not drunk, I am glad<br> to make the moon and my shadow<br> into friends, but then when<br> I have drunk too much, we<br> all part; yet these are<br> friends I can always count on<br> these who have no emotion<br> whatsoever; I hope that one day<br> we three will meet again,<br> deep in the Milky Way. <br></p>

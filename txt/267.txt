<p>My heart was chilled and numb,<br> But my feet were light.<br> I fumbled the glove for my left hand<br> Onto my right.<br> <br> It seemed there were many steps,<br> I knew â€“ there were only three.<br> Autumn, whispering in the maples,<br> Kept urging: 'Die with me!<br> <br> I'm cheated by joylessness,<br> Changed by a destiny untrue.'<br> I answered: 'My dear, my dear!<br> I too: I'll die with you.'<br> <br> The song of the last meeting.<br> I see that dark house again.<br> Only bedroom candles burning,<br> With a yellow, indifferent, flame.<br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me a golden pen, and let me lean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On heaped-up flowers, in regions clear, and far;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring me a tablet whiter than a star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hand of hymning angel, when 'tis seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver strings of heavenly harp atween:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let there glide by many a pearly car
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pink robes, and wavy hair, and diamond jar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half-discovered wings, and glances keen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while let music wander round my ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as it reaches each delicious ending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me write down a line of glorious tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full of many wonders of the spheres:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what a height my spirit is contending!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis not content so soon to be alone.

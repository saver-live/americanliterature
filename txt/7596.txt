<p> "Where have I come from, where did you pick me up?" the baby asked its mother.<br> She answered half crying, half laughing, and clasping the baby to her breast,-- "You were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling.<br> You were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with clay I made the image of my god every morning, I made and unmade you then.<br> You were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship I worshipped you.<br> In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my mother you have lived.<br> In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have been nursed for ages.<br> When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered as a fragrance about it.<br> Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow in the sky before the sunrise.<br> Heaven's first darling, twin-born with the morning light, you have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you have stranded on my heart.<br> As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong to all have become mine.<br> For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast. What magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of mine?"</p>

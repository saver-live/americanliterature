<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a Sabbath-day it fell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That call'd the folk to evening prayer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city streets were clean and fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From wholesome drench of April rains;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, on the western window panes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chilly sunset faintly told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of unmatur'd green vallies cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the green thorny bloomless hedge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rivers new with spring-tide sedge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of primroses by shelter'd rills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And daisies on the aguish hills.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent streets were crowded well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With staid and pious companies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm from their fire-side orat'ries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And moving with demurest air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To even-song and vesper prayer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each arched porch and entry low
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fill'd with patient folk and slow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With whispers hush, and shuffling feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While play'd the organ loud and sweet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells had ceas'd, the prayers begun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bertha had not yet half done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A curious volume, patch'd and torn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all day long, from earliest morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had taken captive her two eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among its golden broideries;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perplex'd her with a thousand things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars of Heaven, and angels' wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martyrs in a fiery blaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azure saints in silver rays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses' breastplate, and the seven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Candlesticks John saw in Heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winged Lion of Saint Mark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Covenantal Ark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its many mysteries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherubim and golden mice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bertha was a maiden fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelling in the old Minster-square;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her fire-side she could see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidelong its rich antiquity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far as the Bishop's garden-wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where sycamores and elm-trees tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-leav'd, the forest had outstript,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By no sharp north-wind ever nipt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So shelter'd by the mighty pile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bertha arose, and read awhile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With forehead 'gainst the window-pane.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again she try'd, and then again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the dusk eve left her dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the legend of St. Mark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From plaited lawn-frill, fine and thin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lifted up her soft warm chin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With aching neck and swimming eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And daz'd with saintly imageries.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was gloom, and silent all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save now and then the still foot-fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one returning homewards late
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the echoing minster-gate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clamorous daws, that all the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above tree-tops and towers play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pair by pair had gone to rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each in its ancient belfry-nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where asleep they fall betimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To music of the drowsy chimes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was silent, all was gloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abroad and in the homely room:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down she sat, poor cheated soul!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And struck a lamp from the dismal coal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean'd forward with bright drooping hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slant book full against the glare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her shadow, in uneasy guise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hover'd about, a giant size,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On ceiling-beam and old oak chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parrot's cage, and panel square;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the warm angled winter screen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which were many monsters seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call'd doves of Siam, Lima mice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And legless birds of Paradise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macaw, and tender Avadavat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silken-furr'd Angora cat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untir'd she read, her shadow still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glower'd about as it would fill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room with wildest forms and shades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though some ghostly queen of spades
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had come to mock behind her back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dance, and ruffle her garments black.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untir'd she read the legend page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of holy Mark, from youth to age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On land, on sea, in pagan chains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoicing for his many pains.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the learned Eremite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With golden star, or dagger bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referr'd to pious poesies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written in smallest crow-quill size
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the text; and thus the rhyme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was parcell'd out from time to time:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Als writith he of swevenis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men han beforne they wake in bliss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whanne that hir friendes thinke him bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In crimped shroude farre under grounde;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how a litling child mote be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A saint er its nativitie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gif that the modre (God her blesse!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kepen in solitarinesse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissen devoute the holy croce.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Goddes love, and Sathan's force,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He writith; and thinges many mo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of swiche thinges I may not show.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bot I must tellen verilie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somdel of Sainte Cicilie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chieftie what he auctorethe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Sainte Markis life and dethe:"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length her constant eyelids come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the fervent martyrdom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then lastly to his holy shrine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exalt amid the tapers' shine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Venice,

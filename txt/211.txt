<p>Drink my soul, as if with a straw<br> I know it's bitter, intoxicating taste.<br> I won't disturb the torment with pleading,<br> Oh, for weeks now I've been at peace.<br> <br> Tell me, when you're done. No sadness,<br> That my soul's no more of this world.<br> I'll walk down that road nearby<br> And see how children play.<br> <br> The gooseberries are in flower,<br> And they're carting bricks by the fence,<br> Who are you, my brother, my lover,<br> I don't know now, or need to know.<br> <br> How bright it is here, and bare,<br> My body, tired, restsâ€¦<br> The passers-by thinking vaguely:<br> Yes, she was widowed yesterday.<br></p>

<p>Though the accompanying frontispiece image for <cite class="al-title">The Good Soldier</cite> is rather plain compared to all the others I have had the honor to republish at this site, it is by far my personal favorite (so far, anyways). I appreciate the behind-the-scenes battle hinted at in the hand-written title: <b>"The Saddest Story."</b> The novel was published in 1915 after the onset of World War I. Ford had suggested the title "The Saddest Story." When his publisher asked for alternatives, he jestingly and sarcastically suggested "The Good Soldier." Unfortunately, business proclivities being what they are, the publisher knew that "war" stories were selling well so that title was selected. As a later compromise, the full title was amended with a subtitle to hint at the stories true nature, <cite class="al-title">"The Good Soldier, <u>A Tale of Passion</u>."</cite> Ford changed his last name from "Hueffer" in 1919, after the book was published.</p><p><cite class="al-title">The Good Soldier</cite> is routinely cited as one of the great works of 20th century English literature and routinely finds its way onto selections like the Modern Library's <cite class="al-title">100 Best English-Language Novels of the 20th Century</cite> where it was ranked 30th in their 1998 survey of their editorial board.

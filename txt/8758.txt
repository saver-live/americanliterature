<p> <cite class="al-title">20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</cite> also known under its longer title, <span class="al-title">Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas: An Underwater Tour of the World</span>, is classic science fiction novel written by <span class="al-author">Jules Verne</span> that was first published in 1870. It is featured in our <a href="/science-fiction-study-guide">Science Fiction Guide</a> and <a href="/books-for-young-readers">Books for Young Readers</a> </p><p> In the story, <span class="al-person">Captain Nemo</span> pilots his vessel, the Nautilus, on an adventure in search of a sea monster that was sighted by a number of ships in 1866. The American government sponsors the mission. This great adventure story is notable for being more scientifically accurate than some of <span class="al-author">Verne's</span> other novels. In particular, the description of the Nautilus is rather prophetic and a fitting description for modern submarines. While there were submarines in existence when the book was written, they were primitive affairs and it took a feat of imagination for the writer to produce his vision of what an underwater craft would look like in the future. </p><p> Readers should note that "Twenty Thousand Leagues" is not the depth to which the Nautilus dives -- the ocean is not that deep -- but describes the distance traveled under the surface of the ocean as the ship and crew adventure around the globe. </p><p><a href="part-one-chapter-1-a-shifting-reef">Part One.: Chapter 1: A Shifting Reef</a></p><p><a

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour fulfils where Music has no power:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By each mans light the unjudging glass betrays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mens surrender, each mans holiest hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the lit confusion of our days 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purfled with iron, traced in dusk and fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenging ordered Time who, at the last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall bring it, grozed and leaded and wedged fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the cold stone that curbs or crowns desire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet on the pavement that all feet have trod 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as the Spirit, in her deeps and heights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns only, and that voiceless, to her God 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There falls no tincture from those anguished lights.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Heavens one light, behind them, striking through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blazons what each man dreamed no other knew.

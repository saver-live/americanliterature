<p>NOW the high holocaust of hours is done,<br> And all the west empurpled with their death,<br> How swift oblivion drinks the fallen sun,<br> How little while the dusk remembereth!<br> <br> Though some there were, proud hours that marched in mail,<br> And took the morning on auspicious crest,<br> Crying to fortune "Back, for I prevail!"--<br> Yet now they lie disfeatured with the rest;<br> <br> And some that stole so soft on destiny<br> Methought they had surprised her to a smile;<br> But these fled frozen when she turned to see,<br> And moaned and muttered through my heart awhile.<br> <br> But now the day is emptied of them all,<br> And night absorbs their life-blood at a draught;<br> And so my life lies, as the gods let fall<br> An empty cup from which their lips have quaffed.<br> <br> Yet see--night is not . . . by translucent ways,<br> Up the grey void of autumn afternoon<br> Steals a mild crescent, charioted in haze,<br> And all the air is merciful as June.<br> <br> The lake is a forgotten streak of day<br> That trembles through the hemlocks' darkling bars,<br> And still, my heart, still some divine delay<br> Upon the threshold holds the earliest stars.<br> <br> O pale equivocal hour, whose suppliant feet<br> Haunt the mute reaches of the sleeping wind,<br> Art thou a watcher stealing to entreat<br> Prayer and sepulture for thy fallen kind?<br> <br> Poor plaintive waif of a predestined race,<br> Their ruin gapes for thee. Why linger here?<br> Go hence in silence. Veil thine orphaned face,<br> Lest I should look on it and call it dear.<br> <br> For if I love thee thou wilt sooner die;<br> Some sudden ruin will plunge upon thy head,<br> Midnight will fall from the revengeful sky<br> And hurl thee down among thy shuddering dead.<br> <br> Avert thine eyes. Lapse softly from my sight,<br> Call not my name, nor heed if thine I crave,<br> So shalt thou sink through mitigated night<br> And bathe thee in the all-effacing wave.<br> <br> But upward still thy perilous footsteps fare<br> Along a high-hung heaven drenched in light,<br> Dilating on a tide of crystal air<br> That floods the dark hills to their utmost height.<br> <br> Strange hour, is this thy waning face that leans<br> Out of mid-heaven and makes my soul its glass?<br> What victory is imaged there? What means<br> Thy tarrying smile? Oh, veil thy lips and pass.<br> <br> Nay . . . pause and let me name thee! For I see,<br> O with what flooding ecstasy of light,<br> Strange hour that wilt not loose thy hold on me,<br> Thou'rt not day's latest, but the first of night!<br> <br> And after thee the gold-foot stars come thick,<br> From hand to hand they toss the flying fire,<br> Till all the zenith with their dance is quick<br> About the wheeling music of the Lyre.<br> <br> Dread hour that lead'st the immemorial round,<br> With lifted torch revealing one by one<br> The thronging splendours that the day held bound,<br> And how each blue abyss enshrines its sun--<br> <br> Be thou the image of a thought that fares<br> Forth from itself, and flings its ray ahead,<br> Leaping the barriers of ephemeral cares,<br> To where our lives are but the ages' tread,<br> <br> And let this year be, not the last of youth,<br> But first--like thee!--of some new train of hours,<br> If more remote from hope, yet nearer truth,<br> And kin to the unpetitionable powers.</p>

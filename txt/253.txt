<p>For O. A. Glebova-Sudeikina<br> <br> 'What do you see, on the wall, dimly alive,<br> At that hour when the sunset eats the sky?<br> <br> A seagull, on a blue cloth of waters,<br> Or perhaps it's those Florentine gardens?<br> <br> Or is it Tsarskoye Seloe's vast view,<br> Where terror stepped out before you?<br> <br> Or that one who left your captivity,<br> And walked into white death, freely?'<br> <br> No, I see only the wall â€“ that shows<br> Reflections of heaven's dying glow.<br></p>

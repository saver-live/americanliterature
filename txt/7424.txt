<p><small><cite class="al-title">Tender Buttons</cite> is one of Stein's best known poems, employing the "stream of consciousness" method similar to works by <a href="/author/virginia-woolf/bio-books-stories">Virginia Woolf</a> and <a href="/author/james-joyce/bio-books-stories">James Joyce</a>. Stein published it in three distinct parts: objects, food, rooms, viewed as an expression of cubism. <br>[<i>Painting at right by Juan Gris, 1915; below by Robert Delaunay, 1910</i>] <br><i>[We present this work as a book, rather than as a poem, so the reader may consider each of its parts individually.]</i></small></p>

<p>To feel thoroughly ill, to sweat in delirium,<br> To meet everyone known again,<br> To roam the broad paths of a sea-side garden,<br> Filled with the wind and sun.<br> <br> Today, even the dead, the exiled,<br> Choose to enter my home.<br> You are leading a child by the hand,<br> I have longed for him so.<br> <br> I'll eat blue grapes with my dear ones,<br> I'll drink the ice cold wine,<br> And watch how the grey waterfall drops<br> Into moist, flinty depths.<br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"Theu theu, ti prosderkesthe m ommasin, tekna;"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Alas, alas, why do you gaze at me with your eyes, my children.]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Medea.</i>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the sorrow comes with years?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that cannot stop their tears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lambs are bleating in the meadows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young birds are chirping in the nest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young fawns are playing with the shadows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young flowers are blowing toward the west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the young, young children, O my brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are weeping bitterly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are weeping in the playtime of the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the country of the free.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you question the young children in the sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why their tears are falling so?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man may weep for his to-morrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is lost in Long Ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old tree is leafless in the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old year is ending in the frost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old hope is hardest to be lost:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the young, young children, O my brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you ask them why they stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our happy Fatherland?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look up with their pale and sunken faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their looks are sad to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the man's grief abhorrent, draws and presses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the cheeks of infancy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your old earth," they say, "is very dreary;"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our young feet," they say, "are very weak!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few paces have we taken, yet are weary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our grave-rest is very far to seek!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask the old why they weep, and not the children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the outside earth is cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the graves are for the old!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True," say the children, "it may happen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we die before our time!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Alice died last year her grave is shapen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a snowball, in the rime.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked into the pit prepared to take her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was no room for any work in the close clay:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying, 'Get up, little Alice! it is day.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you listen by that grave, in sun and shower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your ear down, little Alice never cries;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the smile has time for growing in her eyes ,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shroud, by the kirk-chime!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good when it happens," say the children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That we die before our time!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, the wretched children! they are seeking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death in life, as best to have!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are binding up their hearts away from breaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cerement from the grave.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go out, children, from the mine and from the city
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing out, children, as the little thrushes do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluck you handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they answer, "Are your cowslips of the meadows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like our weeds anear the mine?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From your pleasures fair and fine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For oh," say the children, "we are weary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we cannot run or leap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cared for any meadows, it were merely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drop down in them and sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fall upon our faces, trying to go;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reddest flower would look as pale as snow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, all day, we drag our burden tiring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the coal-dark, underground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the factories, round and round.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For all day, the wheels are droning, turning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wind comes in our faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till our hearts turn, our heads, with pulses burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the walls turn in their places
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns the long light that droppeth down the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are turning, all the day, and we with all!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all day, the iron wheels are droning;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes we could pray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'O ye wheels,' (breaking out in a mad moaning)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Stop! be silent for to-day!'"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay! be silent! Let them hear each other breathing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, mouth to mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their tender human youth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them feel that this cold metallic motion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not all the life God fashions or reveals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them prove their inward souls against the notion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they live in you, or under you, O wheels!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, all day, the iron wheels go onward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if Fate in each were stark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the children's souls, which God is calling sunward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin on blindly in the dark.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now tell the poor young children, O my brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look up to Him and pray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the blessed One, who blesseth all the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will bless them another day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They answer, "Who is God that He should hear us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we sob aloud, the human creatures near us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we hear not (for the wheels in their resounding)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers speaking at the door:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it likely God, with angels singing round Him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hears our weeping any more?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two words, indeed, of praying we remember;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at midnight's hour of harm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our Father,' looking upward in the chamber,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say softly for a charm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know no other words, except 'Our Father,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we think that, in some pause of angels' song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold both within His right hand which is strong.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our Father!' If He heard us, He would surely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For they call Him good and mild)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer, smiling down the steep world very purely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Come and rest with me, my child.'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, no!" say the children, weeping faster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is speechless as a stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they tell us, of His image is the master
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who commands us to work on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to!" say the children, "up in Heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark, wheel-like, turning clouds are all we find!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not mock us; grief has made us unbelieving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look up for God, but tears have made us blind."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do ye hear the children weeping and disproving,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my brothers, what ye preach?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For God's possible is taught by His world's loving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the children doubt of each.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And well may the children weep before you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are weary ere they run;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is brighter than the sun:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know the grief of man, without its wisdom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sink in the despair, without its calm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are slaves, without the liberty in Christdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are martyrs, by the pang without the palm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are worn, as if with age, yet unretrievingly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No dear remembrance keep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them weep! let them weep!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look up, with their pale and sunken faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their look is dread to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they think you see their angels in their places,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes meant for Deity;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long," they say, "how long, O cruel nation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tread onward to your throne amid the mart?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our blood splashes upward, O our tyrants,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your purple shews your path;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the child's sob curseth deeper in the silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the strong man in his wrath!"

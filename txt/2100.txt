<p>'TIS the year's midnight, and it<br> is the day's,<br> Lucy's, who scarce seven hours herself unmasks;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>The sun is spent, and now his flasks<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Send forth light squibs, no constant rays;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>The world's whole sap is sunk;<br> The general balm th' hydroptic earth hath drunk,<br> Whither, as to the bed's-feet, life is shrunk,<br> Dead and interr'd; yet all these seem to laugh,<br> Compared with me, who am their epitaph.<br> <br> Study me then, you who shall lovers be<br> At the next world, that is, at the next spring;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>For I am every dead thing,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>In whom Love wrought new alchemy.<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>For his art did express<br> A quintessence even from nothingness,<br> From dull privations, and lean emptiness;<br> He ruin'd me, and I am re-begot<br> Of absence, darkness, death—things which are not.<br> <br> All others, from all things, draw all that's good,<br> Life, soul, form, spirit, whence they being have;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>I, by Love's limbec, am the grave<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Of all, that's nothing. Oft a flood<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>Have we two wept, and so<br> Drown'd the whole world, us two; oft did we grow,<br> To be two chaoses, when we did show<br> Care to aught else; and often absences<br> Withdrew our souls, and made us carcasses.<br> <br> But I am by her death—which word wrongs her—<br> Of the first nothing the elixir grown;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Were I a man, that I were one<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>I needs must know; I should prefer,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>If I were any beast,<br> Some ends, some means; yea plants, yea stones detest,<br> And love; all, all some properties invest.<br> If I an ordinary nothing were,<br> As shadow, a light, and body must be here.<br> <br> But I am none; nor will my sun renew.<br> You lovers, for whose sake the lesser sun<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>At this time to the Goat is run<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>To fetch new lust, and give it you,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>Enjoy your summer all,<br> Since she enjoys her long night's festival.<br> Let me prepare towards her, and let me call<br> This hour her vigil, and her eve, since this<br> Both the year's and the day's deep midnight is.</p>

<p>True pleasure breathes not city air,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor in Art's temples dwells,<br> In palaces and towers where<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Grandeur dwells.<br> <br> No! Seek it where high Nature holds<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her court 'mid stately groves,<br> Where she her majesty unfolds,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in fresh beauty moves;<br> <br> Where thousand birds of sweetest song,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wildly rushing storm<br> And hundred streams which glide along,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mighty concert form!<br> <br> Go where the woods in beauty sleep<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathed in pale Luna's light,<br> Or where among their branches sweep<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hollow sounds of night.<br> <br> Go where the warbling nightingale<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gushes rich doth sing,<br> Till all the lonely, quiet vale<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With melody doth ring.<br> <br> Go, sit upon a mountain steep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And view the prospect round;<br> The hills and vales, the valley's sweep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far horizon bound.<br> <br> Then view the wide sky overhead,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The still, deep vault of blue,<br> The sun which golden light doth shed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds of pearly hue.<br> <br> And as you gaze on this vast scene<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your thoughts will journey far,<br> Though hundred years should roll between<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Time's swift-passing car.<br> <br> To ages when the earth was young,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When patriarchs, grey and old,<br> The praises of their god oft sung,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oft his mercies told.<br> <br> You see them with their beards of snow,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their robes of ample form,<br> Their lives whose peaceful, gentle flow,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt seldom passion's storm.<br> <br> Then a calm, solemn pleasure steals<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into your inmost mind;<br> A quiet aura your spirit feels,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A softened stillness kind.</p>

1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conspiring with him how to load and bless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still more, later flowers for the bees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until they think warm days will never cease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.

2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady thy laden head across a brook;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.

3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the river sallows, borne aloft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

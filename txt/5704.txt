<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What phantom is this that appears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the purple mist of the years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Itself but a mist like these?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman of cloud and of fire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is she; it is Helen of Tyre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The town in the midst of the seas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Tyre! in thy crowded streets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom appears and retreats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Israelites that sell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy lilies and lions of brass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up as they see her pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And murmur "Jezebel!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another phantom is seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At her side, in a gray gabardine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With beard that floats to his waist;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Simon Magus, the Seer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaks, and she pauses to hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words he utters in haste.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says: "From this evil fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this life of sorrow and shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will lift thee and make thee mine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast been Queen Candace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Helen of Troy, and shalt be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Intelligence Divine!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, sweet as the breath of morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fallen and forlorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are whispered words of praise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the famished heart believes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The falsehood that tempts and deceives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the promise that betrays.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she follows from land to land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard's beckoning hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a leaf is blown by the gust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till she vanishes into night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O reader, stoop down and write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With thy finger in the dust.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O town in the midst of the seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thy rafts of cedar trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy merchandise and thy ships,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, too, art become as naught,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom, a shadow, a thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A name upon men's lips.

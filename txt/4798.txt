<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now, held in captivity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring to our labours nor greive!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See now, how it is a blesseder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brothers, to give than to receive!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep trust, wherefore ye were made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying the duty ye owe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a clean thrust and the sheer of the blade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall carry us where we should go.
</pre>

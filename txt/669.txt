<p>Far up river in Szechuan,<br> waters rise as spring winds roar.<br> <br> How can I dare to meet her now,<br> to brave the dangerous gorge?<br> <br> The grass grows green in the valley below<br> where silk worms silently spin.<br> <br> Her hands work threads that never end,<br> dawn to dusk when the cuckoo sings.<br></p>

<p>&nbsp;<br> While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead<br> I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.<br> You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse;<br> You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.<br> And we went on living in the village of Chokan:<br> Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.<br> <br> At fourteen I married My Lord you.<br> I never laughed, being bashful.<br> Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.<br> Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.<br> <br> At fifteen I stopped scowling,<br> I desired my dust to be mingled with yours<br> Forever and forever and forever.<br> Why should I climb the lookout?<br> <br> At sixteen you departed,<br> You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,<br> And you have been gone five months.<br> The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.<br> <br> You dragged your feet when you went out.<br> By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,<br> Too deep to clear them away!<br> The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.<br> The paired butterflies are already yellow with August<br> Over the grass in the West garden --<br> They hurt me.<br> I grow older.<br> If you are coming down through the narrows of the river,<br> Please let me know beforehand,<br> And I will come out to meet you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Cho-fo-Sa.</p>

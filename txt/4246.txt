<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still as the silence round about his lair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forest on forest hung above his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so much life as on a summer's day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By reason of his fallen divinity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No further than to where his feet had stray'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there came one, who with a kindred hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reverence, though to one who knew it not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a Goddess of the infant world;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By her in stature the tall Amazon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta'en
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedestal'd haply in a palace court,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh! how unlike marble was that face:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beautiful, if sorrow had not made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a listening fear in her regard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if calamity had but begun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the vanward clouds of evil days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was with its stored thunder labouring up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand she press'd upon that aching spot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where beats the human heart, as if just there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other upon Saturn's bended neck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laid, and to the level of his ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In solemn tenor and deep organ tone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would come in these like accents; O how frail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that large utterance of the early Gods!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Saturn, look up!though wherefore, poor old King?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no comfort for thee, no not one:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot say, 'O wherefore sleepest thou?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scorches and burns our once serene domain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O aching time! O moments big as years!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And press it so upon our weary griefs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That unbelief has not a space to breathe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn, sleep on:O thoughtless, why did I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when, upon a tranced summer-night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save from one gradual solitary gust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the ebbing air had but one wave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So came these words and went; the while in tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just where her fallen hair might be outspread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moon, with alteration slow, had shed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her silver seasons four upon the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still these two were postured motionless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frozen God still couchant on the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at length old Saturn lifted up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the gloom and sorrow ofthe place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up, and let me see our doom in it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked and bare of its great diadem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peers like the front of Saturn? Who had power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make me desolate? Whence came the strength?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is so; and I am smother'd up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buried from all godlike exercise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of influence benign on planets pale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of admonitions to the winds and seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all those acts which Deity supreme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth ease its heart of love in.I am gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from my own bosom: I have left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My strong identity, my real self,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space region'd with life-air; and barren void;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain shape or shadow, making way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wings or chariot fierce to repossess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heaven he lost erewhile: it mustit must
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be of ripe progressSaturn must be King.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there must be a golden victory;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful things made new, for the surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sky-children; I will give command:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passion lifted him upon his feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made his hands to struggle in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little time, and then again he snatch'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utterance thus."But cannot I create?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another world, another universe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overbear and crumble this to nought?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is another Chaos? Where?"That word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found way unto Olympus, and made quake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebel three.Thea was startled up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in her bearing was a sort of hope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the covert, for thence came I hither."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With backward footing through the shade a space:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groan'd for the old allegiance once more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sov'reigny, and rule, and majesy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From man to the sun's God: yet unsecure:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as among us mortals omens drear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the familiar visiting of one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagles' wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of sweets, his ample palate took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savor of poisonous brass and metal sick:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, when harbor'd in the sleepy west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the full completion of fair day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rest divine upon exalted couch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slumber in the arms of melody,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While far within each aisle and deep recess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His winged minions in close clusters stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amaz'd and full offear; like anxious men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went step for step with Thea through the woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came slope upon the threshold of the west;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That inlet to severe magnificence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he reach'd the great main cupola;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the basements deep to the high towers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jarr'd his own golden region; and before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this result: "O dreams of day and night!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O lank-eared phantoms of black-weeded pools!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my eternal essence thus distraught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see and to behold these horrors new?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I to leave this haven of my rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cradle of my glory, this soft clime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calm luxuriance of blissful light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all my lucent empire? It is left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see but darkness, death, and darkness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even here, into my centre of repose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shady visions come to domineer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall!No, by Tellus and her briny robes!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the fiery frontier of my realms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will advance a terrible right arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bid old Saturn take his throne again."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held struggle with his throat but came not forth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as in theatres of crowded men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubbub increases more they call out "Hush!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at Hyperion's words the phantoms pale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the mirror'd level where he stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this, through all his bulk an agony
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From over-strained might. Releas'd, he fled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the dawn in season due should blush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each day from east to west the heavens through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ever and anon the glancing spheres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the zenith,hieroglyphics old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then living on the earth, with laboring thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Won from the gaze of many centuries:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of stone, or rnarble swart; their import gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wisdom long since fled.Two wings this orb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever exalted at the God's approach:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting for Hyperion's command.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bid the day begin, if but for change.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might not:No, though a primeval God:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the operations of the dawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those silver wings expanded sisterly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit to the sorrow of the time;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all along a dismal rack of clouds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the boundaries of day and night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Coelus, from the universal space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O brightest of my children dear, earth-born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sky-engendered, son of mysteries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unrevealed even to the powers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which met at thy creating; at whose joys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, Coelus, wonder, how they came and whence;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinct, and visible; symbols divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manifestations of that beauteous life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these new-form'd art thou, O brightest child!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of son against his sire. I saw him fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me his arms were spread, to me his voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found way from forth the thunders round his head!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine ye were created, and divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions of rage and passion; even as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see them, on the mortal world beneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In men who die.This is the grief, O son!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As thou canst move about, an evident God;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And canst oppose to each malignant hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethereal presence:I am but a voice;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life is but the life of winds and tides,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than winds and tides can I avail:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou canst.Be thou therefore in the van
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the tense string murmur.To the earth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of thy seasons be a careful nurse."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere half this region-whisper had come down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperion arose, and on the stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still they were the same bright, patient stars.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a slow incline of his broad breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to a diver in the pearly seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.

<p><br> The Walrus and the Carpenter<br> &nbsp;Were walking close at hand;<br> They wept like anything to see<br> &nbsp;Such quantities of sand:<br> 'If this were only cleared away,'<br> &nbsp;They said, 'it would be grand!'<br> <br> 'If seven maids with seven mops<br> &nbsp;Swept it for half a year,<br> Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,<br> &nbsp;'That they could get it clear?'<br> 'I doubt it,' said the Carpenter,<br> &nbsp;And shed a bitter tear.<br> <br> 'O Oysters, come and walk with us!'<br> &nbsp;The Walrus did beseech.<br> 'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br> &nbsp;Along the briny beach:<br> We cannot do with more than four,<br> &nbsp;To give a hand to each.<br> <br> The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br> &nbsp;But never a word he said:<br> The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br> &nbsp;And shook his heavy head—<br> Meaning to say he did not choose<br> &nbsp;To leave the oyster-bed.<br> <br> But four young Oysters hurried up,<br> &nbsp;All eager for the treat:<br> Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br> &nbsp;Their shoes were clean and neat—<br> And this was odd, because, you know,<br> &nbsp;They hadnt any feet.<br> <br> Four other Oysters followed them,<br> &nbsp;And yet another four;<br> And thick and fast they came at last,<br> &nbsp;And more, and more, and more—<br> All hopping through the frothy waves,<br> &nbsp;And scrambling to the shore.<br> <br> The Walrus and the Carpenter<br> &nbsp;Walked on a mile or so,<br> And then they rested on a rock<br> &nbsp;Conveniently low:<br> And all the little Oysters stood<br> &nbsp;And waited in a row.<br> <br> 'The time has come,' the Walrus said,<br> &nbsp;'To talk of many things:<br> Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax—<br> &nbsp;Of cabbages—and kings—<br> And why the sea is boiling hot—<br> &nbsp;And whether pigs have wings.'<br> <br> <img src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/walrus-carpenter-2.jpg" alt="An image of the Walrus and the Carpenter" data-pagespeed-url-hash="408143949" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p>
<p><br> 'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,<br> &nbsp;'Before we have our chat;<br> For some of us are out of breath,<br> &nbsp;And all of us are fat!'<br> 'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.<br> &nbsp;They thanked him much for that.<br> <br> 'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,<br> &nbsp;'Is what we chiefly need:<br> Pepper and vinegar besides<br> &nbsp;Are very good indeed—<br> Now if you are ready, Oysters dear,<br> &nbsp;We can begin to feed!<br> <br> 'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,<br> &nbsp;Turning a little blue.<br> 'After such kindness, that would be<br> &nbsp;A dismal thing to do!'<br> 'The night is fine,' the Walrus said.<br> &nbsp;'Do you admire the view?<br> <br> 'It was so kind of you to come!<br> &nbsp;And you are very nice!'<br> The Carpenter said nothing but<br> &nbsp;'Cut us another slice:<br> I wish you were not quite so deaf—<br> &nbsp;I've had to ask you twice!'<br> <br> 'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,<br> &nbsp;'To play them such a trick,<br> After we've brought them out so far,<br> &nbsp;And made them trot so quick!'<br> The Carpenter said nothing but<br> &nbsp;'The butter's spread too thick!'<br> <br> <img src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/walrus-carpenter-3.jpg" alt="An image of the Walrus and the Carpenter" data-pagespeed-url-hash="702643870" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p>
<p><br> 'I weep for you,' the Walrus said.<br> &nbsp;'I deeply sympathize!<br> With sobs and tears he sorted out<br> &nbsp;Those of the largest size,<br> Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br> &nbsp;Before his streaming eyes.<br> <br> 'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,<br> &nbsp;'You've had a pleasant run!<br> Shall we be trotting home again?'<br> &nbsp;But answer came there none—<br> And this was scarcely odd, because<br> &nbsp;They'd eaten every one."<br> </p>

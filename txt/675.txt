<p>A pity it is evening, yet<br> I do love the water of this spring<br> seeing how clear it is, how clean;<br> rays of sunset gleam on it,<br> lighting up its ripples, making it<br> one with those who travel<br> the roads; I turn and face<br> the moon; sing it a song, then<br> listen to the sound of the wind<br> amongst the pines. <br></p>

The play explores the psychological aspects of sex, pushing the boundaries of obscenity with a <i>"sincerity which makes him see and tell the upmost truth with a daintiness that puts offence out of the question."</i> His widely recognized novel published the year before, <a href="/author/d-h-lawrence/book/sons-and-lovers">Sons and Lovers</a> was roundly criticized at the time for its perceived obscenities. it has since become a widely recognized literary classic.</p><p><a href="introduction">Introduction</a></p><p><a href="list-of-characters">List of Characters</a></p><p><a href="the-first-act-scene-i">The First Act - Scene I</a></p><p><a href="act-i-scene-ii">Act I - Scene II</a></p><p><a href="the-second-act">The Second Act</a></p><p><a href="the-third-act">The Third Act</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/d-h-lawrence">D.

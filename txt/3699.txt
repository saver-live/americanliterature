&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star and coronal and bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April underfoot renews,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hope of man as well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers among the morning dews.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the old come out to look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter past and winter's pains.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the sky in pool and brook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glitters on the grassy plains.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easily the gentle air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wafts the turning season on;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things to comfort them are there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though 'tis true the best are gone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the scorned unlucky lad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rousing from his pillow gnawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mans his heart and deep and glad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinks the valiant air of dawn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half the night he longed to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now are sown on hill and plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasures worth his while to try
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he longs to die again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue the sky from east to west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arches, and the world is wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the girl he loves the best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rouses from another's side.

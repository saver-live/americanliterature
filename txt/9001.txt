MY feet have touched the Dancing Water,
  My lips have kissed the Singing Rose
And I was born a swan-girl's daughter . . .
Oh, I would stay with you, my lover,
  But in my heart a sea wind blows
And in the dark the wild swans hover . . .

Tonight as I went down to sea
  To cast my net, to draw my net,
The Marsh-King's daughter whispered me,
  "Sister," she called, "do you forget?"
For though I am a fisher's child
  It was a swan-maid mothered me,
And I have wings that I can don
When day is done, when dark comes on,
  To bear me high across the sea.

One star-dusk when I waited you
  And it was long before you came,
There was a bird with wings of blue
  And claws of gold and crest of flame
Who sang with words as mortals do:
  He sang me of an ivory fountain
  Within a wood beyond a mountain
Where lies beneath the water's flow
  A golden key, a silver cup,
  Until my hand shall lift them up . . .
  (Oh, I must go from you, my lover!)
For they were mine once long ago.

How shall you keep me, dear my lover?
  My heart is yours till night-winds call,
And then dear earth-things fade and fall
  (Oh, I was born a swan-girl's daughter!)
For I have found beneath the moon
Brown fairy fernseed for my shoon
  That carries me where no man knows,
Beyond the sands, beyond the clover . . .
I cannot bide with you, my lover . . .
  My feet have touched the Dancing Water,
  My lips have kissed the Singing Rose.

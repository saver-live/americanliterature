<p>Jade carved dishes - food costing more.<br> I throw the chopsticks down,<br> Food and wine are tasteless.<br> Draw my magic sword,<br> Mind confused stare round me.<br> See the ice floes block the Yellow River.<br> Feel the snowfall shroud the Tâai-hang Mountains.<br> Quiet again I cast in dark waters,<br> Find the fragile boat that might drift sunwards.<br> Hard Journey. So many side-tracks.<br> Turn after turn, and where am I?<br> New breezes flatten down the waves ahead.<br> I'll set cloud sails, cross the Blue Horizon. <br></p>

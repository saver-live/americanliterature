<p> The boat of the boatman Madhu is moored at the wharf of Rajgunj.<br> It is uselessly laden with jute, and has been lying there idle for ever so long.<br> If he would only lend me his boat, I should man her with a hundred oars, and hoist sails, five or six or seven.<br> I should never steer her to stupid markets. I should sail the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.<br> But, mother, you won't weep for me in a corner.<br> I am not going into the forest like Ramachandra to come back only after fourteen years.<br> I shall become the prince of the story, and fill my boat with whatever I like.<br> I shall take my friend Ashu with me. We shall sail merrily across the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.<br> We shall set sail in the early morning light.<br> When at noontide you are bathing at the pond, we shall be in the land of a strange king.<br> We shall pass the ford of Tirpurni, and leave behind us the desert of Tep√¢ntar.<br> When we come back it will be getting dark, and I shall tell you of all that we have seen.<br> I shall cross the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of fairyland.</p>

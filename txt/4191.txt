<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperion slid into the rustled air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a den where no insulting light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever as if just rising from a sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus in thousand hugest phantasies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stubborn'd with iron. All were not assembled:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some chain'd in torture, and some wandering.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caus, and Gyges, and Briareus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many more, the brawniest in assault,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were pent in regions of laborious breath;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dungeon'd in opaque element, to keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a motion, save of their big hearts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mnemosyne was straying in the world;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many else were free to roam abroad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the main, here found they covert drear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce images of life, one here, one there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dull November, and their chancel vault,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or word, or look, or action of despair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creus was one; his ponderous iron mace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iapetus another; in his grasp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squeez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead: and because the creature could not spit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though in pain; for still upon the flint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ground severe his skull, with open mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eyes at horrid working. Nearest him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asia, born of most enormous Caf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though feminine, than any of her sons:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More thought than woe was in her dusky face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she was prophesying of her glory;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in her wide imagination stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shed from the broadest of her elephants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As grazing ox unworried in the meads;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meditated, plotted, and even now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hurling mountains in that second war,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long delay'd, that scar'd the younger Gods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour'd close
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Ops the queen; all clouded round from sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No shape distinguishable, more than when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many else whose names may not be told.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With damp and slippery footing from a depth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till on the level height their steps found ease:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There saw she direst strife; the supreme God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At war with all the frailty of grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disanointing poison: so that Thea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with us mortal men, the laden heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is persecuted more, and fever'd more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is nighing to the mournful house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that he met Enceladus's eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came like an inspiration; and he shouted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Titans, behold your God!" at which some groan'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some started on their feet; some also shouted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among immortals when a God gives sign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hushing finger, how he means to load
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tongue with the filll weight of utterless thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew up like organ, that begins anew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus grew it up "Not in my own sad breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is its own great judge and searcher out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in the legends of the first of days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studied from that old spirit-leaved book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which starry Uranus with finger bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the which book ye know I ever kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my firm-based footstool: Ah, infirm!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One against one, or two, or three, or all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each several one against the other three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drown both, and press them both against earth's face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhinges the poor world; not in that strife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, nowhere can unriddle, though I search,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pore on Nature's universal scroll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to swooning, why ye, Divinities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first-born of all shap'd and palpable Gods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should cower beneath what, in comparison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is untremendous might. Yet ye are here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Titans, shall I say 'Arise!' Ye groan:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I say 'Crouch!' Ye groan. What can I then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we can war, how engine our great wrath!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O speak your counsel now, for Saturn's ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is all a-hunger'd. Thou, Oceanus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see, astonied, that severe content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So ended Saturn; and the God of the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cogitation in his watery shades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arose, with locks not oozy, and began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O ye, whom wrath consumes! who, passion-stung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My voice is not a bellows unto ire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the proof much comfort will I give,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ye will take that comfort in its truth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fall by course of Nature's law, not force
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast sifted well the atom-universe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this reason, that thou art the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only blind from sheer supremacy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One avenue was shaded from thine eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through which I wandered to eternal truth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So art thou not the last; it cannot be:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art not the beginning nor the end.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Chaos and parental Darkness came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with it Light, and Light, engendering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its own producer, forthwith touch'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole enormous matter into life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon that very hour, our parentage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thou first born, and we the giant race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O folly! for to bear all naked truths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to envisage circumstance, all calm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In form and shape compact and beautiful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In will, in action free, companionship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thousand other signs of purer life;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A power more strong in beauty, born of us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fated to excel us, as we pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In glory that old Darkness: nor are we
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feedeth still, more comely than itself?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or shall the tree be envious of the dove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wander wherewithal and find its joys?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above us in their beauty, and must reign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That first in beauty should be first in might:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, by that law, another race may drive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have ye beheld the young God of the seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By noble winged creatures he hath made?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw him on the calmed waters scud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all my empire: farewell sad I took,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hither came, to see how dolorous fate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give consolation in this woe extreme.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive the truth, and let it be your balm."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether through pos'd conviction, or disdain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They guarded silence, when Oceanus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so it was, none answer'd for a space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus wording timidly among the fierce:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Father! I am here the simplest voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There to remain for ever, as I fear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not bode of evil, if I thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So weak a creature could turn off the help
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what I heard, and how it made me weep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know that we had parted from all hope.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that I felt a movement in my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To chide, and to reproach that solitude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With songs of misery, music of our woes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmur'd into it, and made melody
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O melody no more! for while I sang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with poor skill let pass into the breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just opposite, an island of the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came enchantment with the shifting wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That did both drown and keep alive my ears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I threw my shell away upon the sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that new blissful golden melody.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A living death was in each gush of sounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each family of rapturous hurried notes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fell, one after one, yet all at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then another, then another strain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With music wing'd instead of silent plumes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hover round my head, and make me sick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of joy and grief at once. Grief overcame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was stopping up my frantic ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still it cried, 'Apollo! young Apollo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fled, it follow'd me, and cried 'Apollo!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye would not call this too indulged tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, lingering along a pebbled coast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shudder'd; for the overwhelming voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came booming thus, while still upon his arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lean'd; not rising, from supreme contempt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or shall we listen to the over-wise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rebel Jove's whole armoury were spent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could agonize me more than baby-words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In midst of this dethronement horrible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy scalding in the seas? What! have I rous'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your spleens with so few simple words as these?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O joy! for now I see ye are not lost:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O joy! for now I see a thousand eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide-glaring for revenge!" As this he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still without intermission speaking thus:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now ye are flames, I'll tell you how to burn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And purge the ether of our enemies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stifling that puny essence in its tent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let him feel the evil he hath done;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For though I scorn Oceanus's lore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much pain have I for more than loss of realms:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of peace and slumbrous calm are fled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those days, all innocent of scathing war,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the fair Existences of heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carne open-eyed to guess what we would speak:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was before our brows were taught to frown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was before we knew the winged thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victory, might be lost, or might be won.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be ye mindful that Hyperion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperion, lo! his radiance is here!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes were on Enceladus's face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they beheld, while still Hyperion's name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pallid gleam across his features stern:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not savage, for he saw full many a God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wroth as himself. He look'd upon them all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in each face he saw a gleam of light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But splendider in Saturn's, whose hoar locks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pale and silver silence they remain'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till suddenly a splendor, like the morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sad spaces of oblivion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every gulf, and every chasm old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every height, and every sullen depth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the everlasting cataracts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the headlong torrents far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mantled before in darkness and huge shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now saw the light and made it terrible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Hyperion: a granite peak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bright feet touch'd, and there he stay'd to view
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The misery his brilliance had betray'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the most hateful seeing of itself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden his hair of short Numidian curl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In midst of his own brightness, like the bulk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Memnon's image at the set of sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one who travels from the dusking East:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon's harp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He utter'd, while his hands contemplative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He press'd together, and in silence stood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despondence seiz'd again the fallen Gods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sight of the dejected King of day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many hid their faces from the light:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the brotherhood; and, at their glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprose Iapetus, and Creus too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where he towered on his eminence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There those four shouted forth old Saturn's name;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperion from the peak loud answered, "Saturn!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whose face was no joy, though all the Gods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave from their hollow throats the name of "Saturn!"

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother of Hermes! and still youthful Maia!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I sing to thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As thou wast hymned on the shores of Baiae?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or may I woo thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In earlier Sicilian? or thy smiles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seek as they once were sought, in Grecian isles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By bards who died content on pleasant sward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving great verse unto a little clan?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O give me their old vigour! and unheard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save of the quiet primrose, and the span
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven, and few ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rounded by thee, my song should die away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content as theirs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich in the simple worship of a day.
</pre>

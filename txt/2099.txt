<p>STAND still, and I will read to thee<br> A lecture, Love, in Love's philosophy.<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>These three hours that we have spent,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Walking here, two shadows went<br> Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.<br> But, now the sun is just above our head,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>We do those shadows tread,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.<br> So whilst our infant loves did grow,<br> Disguises did, and shadows, flow<br> From us and our cares; but now 'tis not so.<br> <br> That love hath not attain'd the highest degree,<br> Which is still diligent lest others see.<br> <br> Except our loves at this noon stay,<br> We shall new shadows make the other way.<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>As the first were made to blind<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Others, these which come behind<br> Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.<br> If our loves faint, and westerwardly decline,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>To me thou, falsely, thine<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.<br> The morning shadows wear away,<br> But these grow longer all the day;<br> But O! love's day is short, if love decay.<br> <br> Love is a growing, or full constant light,<br> And his short minute, after noon, is night.</p>

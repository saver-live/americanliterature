<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!Full Chorus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Him Who bade the Heavens abide, yet cease not from their motion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Him Who tames the moonstruck tide twice a day round Ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let His Names be magnified in all poor folks devotion!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers and Gifts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for Prophecies or Powers, Visions, Gifts, or Graces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the unregardful hours that grind us in our places
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the burden on our backs, the weather in our faces.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toils.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for any Miracle of easy Loaves and Fishes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for doing, gainst our will, work against our wishes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as finding food to fill daily-emptied dishes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glories.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for Voices, Harps or Wings or rapt illumination,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the grosser Self that springs of use and occupation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto which the Spirit clings as her last salvation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers, Glories, Toils, and Gifts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He Who launched our Ship of Fools many anchors gave us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest one gale should start them all, one collision stave us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise Him for the petty creeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That prescribe in paltry needs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemn rites to trivial deeds and, by small things, save us!)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services and Loves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart may fail, and Strength outwear, and Purpose turn to Loathing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the everyday affair of business, meals, and clothing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builds a bulkhead twixt Despair and the Edge of Nothing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patiences.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Praise Him, then, Who orders it that, though Earth be flaring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the crazy skies are lit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the searchlights of the Pit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man should not depart a whit from his wonted bearing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Who bids the wild-swans host still maintain their flight on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air-roads over islands lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ages since neath Ocean lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beaches of some sunken coast their fathers would alight on,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faiths.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall guide us through this dark, not by new-blown glories,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by every ancient mark our fathers used before us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till our children ground their ark where the proper shore is.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services, Patiences, Faiths, Hopes, and Loves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Who used the clay that clings on our boots to make us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not suffer earthly things to remove or shake us:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, when Man denies His Lord,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habit without Fleet or Sword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Custom without threat or word)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees the ancient fanes restored, the timeless rites oertake us.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full Chorus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For He Who makes the Mountains smoke and rives the Hills asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, to-morrow, leads the grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere unconquerable grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the fuming crater was, to heal and hide it under,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall not, He shall not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not lay on us the yoke of too long Fear and Wonder!

<p> There is a town in England called Go-tham, and many merry stories are told of the queer people who used to live there. </p><p> One day two men of Go-tham met on a bridge. Hodge was coming from the market, and Peter was going to the market. </p><p> "Where are you going?" said Hodge. </p><p> "I am going to the market to buy sheep," said Peter. </p><p> "Buy sheep?" said Hodge. "And which way will you bring them home?" </p><p> "I shall bring them over this bridge," said Peter. </p><p> "No, you shall not," said Hodge. </p><p> "Yes, but I will," said Peter. </p><p> "You shall not," said Hodge. </p><p> "I will," said Peter. </p><p> Then they beat with their sticks on the ground as though there had been a hundred sheep between them. </p><p> "Take care!" cried Peter. "Look out that my sheep don't jump on the bridge." </p><p> "I care not where they jump," said Hodge; "but they shall not go over it." </p><p> "But they shall," said Peter. </p><p> "Have a care," said Hodge; "for if you say too much, I will put my fingers in your mouth." </p><p> "Will you?" said Peter. </p><p> Just then another man of Gotham came from the market with a sack of meal on his horse. He heard his neigh-bors quar-rel-ing about sheep; but he could see no sheep between them, and so he stopped and spoke to them. </p><p> "Ah, you foolish fellows!" he cried. "It is strange that you will never learn wisdom.--Come here, Peter, and help me lay my sack on my shoul-der." </p><p> Peter did so, and the man carried his meal to the side of the bridge. </p><p> "Now look at me," he said, "and learn a lesson." And he opened the mouth of the sack, and poured all the meal into the river. </p><p> "Now, neighbors," he said, "can you tell how much meal is in my sack?" </p><p> "There is none at all!" cried Hodge and Peter together. </p><p> "You are right," said the man; "and you that stand here and quarrel about nothing, have no more sense in your heads than I have meal in my sack!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

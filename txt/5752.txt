&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neglected record of a mind neglected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto what "lets and stops" art thou subjected!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day with all its toils and occupations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night with its reflections and sensations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future, and the present, and the past,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I remember, feel, and hope at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shapes of joy and sorrow, as they pass,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find but a dusty image in this glass.

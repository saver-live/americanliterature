&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward led the road again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the sad uncoloured plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under twilight brooding dim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And along the utmost rim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wall and rampart risen to sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast a shadow not of night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beyond them seemed to glow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonfires lighted long ago.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my dark conductor broke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence at my side and spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "You conjecture well:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder is the gate of hell."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill as yet the eye could see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal masonry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beneath it on the dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To and fro there stirred a spark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again the sombre guide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew my question, and replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At hell gate the damned in turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pace for sentinel and burn."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dully at the leaden sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staring, and with idle eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring the listless plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began to think again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things I thought of then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battle, and the loves of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cities entered, oceans crossed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge gained and virtue lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cureless folly done and said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lovely way that led
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the slimepit and the mire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the everlasting fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And against a smoulder dun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a dawn without a sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the nearing bastion loom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And across the gate of gloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still one saw the sentry go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trim and burning, to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One for women to admire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his finery of fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something, as I watched him pace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minded me of time and place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers of another corps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a sentry known before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever darker hell on high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reared its strength upon the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our football on the track
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fetched the daunting echo back.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soldier pacing still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insuperable sill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nursing his tormented pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned his head to neither side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunk into himself apart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hell-fire of his heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But against our entering in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the drawbridge Death and Sin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose to render key and sword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their father and their lord.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the portress foul to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted up her eyes on me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling, and I made reply:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Met again, my lass," said I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the sentry turned his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked, and knew me, and was Ned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once he looked, and halted straight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set his back against the gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught his musket to his chin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the hive of hell within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent abroad a seething hum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of towns whose king is come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading conquest home from far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the captives of his war,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the car of triumph waits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they open wide the gates.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But across the entry barred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straddled the revolted guard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaponed and accoutred well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the arsenals of hell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beside him, sick and white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin to left and Death to right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned a countenance of fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the flaming mutineer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over us the darkness bowed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the anger in the cloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clenched the lightning for the stroke;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the traitor musket spoke.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hollowness of hell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded as its master fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mourning echo rolled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruin through his kingdom old.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyranny and terror flown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left a pair of friends alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beneath the nether sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that stirred was he and I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent, nothing found to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We began the backward way;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ebbing luster died
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the soldier at my side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in all his spruce attire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed the everlasting fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midmost of the homeward track
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we listened and looked back;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the city, dusk and mute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slept, and there was no pursuit.

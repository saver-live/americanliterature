<p> Chuang Tzu in dream became a butterfly,<br> And the butterfly became Chuang Tzu at waking.<br> Which was the real-- the butterfly or the man?<br> Who can tell the end of the endless changes of things?<br> The water that flows into the depth of the distant sea<br> Returns anon to the shallows of a transparent stream.<br> The man, raising melons outside the green gate of the city,<br> Was once the Prince of the East Hill.<br> So must rank and riches vanish.<br> You know it, still you toil and toil-- what for? <br> </p>

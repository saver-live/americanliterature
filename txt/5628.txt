               The weasel thieves in silver suit,
               The rabbit runs in gray,
               And Pan takes up his frosty flute
               To pipe the cold away.
               The flocks are folded, boughs are bare,
               The salmon takes the sea;
               And oh, my fair, would I somewhere
               Might house my heart with thee.

<p>This farcical comedy, often abbreviated from its full title: <cite class="al-title">The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People</cite> was written and first performed at the St. James Theater in London on February 14, 1895. With a lead character like Algernon Moncrieff (Algy), set in London's fashionable West End, how can you go wrong? Eccentric characters and rapid-fire wit keep Oscar Wilde's work relevant and entertaining today. It's been adapted for film and numerous renditions for the stage. While reading the screenplay is delightful, watching it performed is more so. <a href="summary">The Importance of Being Earnest</a> and <a href="/author/oscar-wilde/play/an-ideal-husband/summary">An Ideal Husband</a> are considered Wilde's masterful dramatic works. </p><p><i>"My ideal has always been to love someone of the name of Ernest.

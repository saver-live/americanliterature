<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as at all times I can see in the minds eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their stiff, painted clothes, the pale unsatisfied ones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all their ancient faces like rain-beaten stones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all their helms of silver hovering side by side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all their eyes still fixed, hoping to find once more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being by Calvarys turbulence unsatisfied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WRITTEN ON REVISITING BRUNSWICK IN THE SUMMER OF 1875

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many lives that I have known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None I remember more serene and sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More rounded in itself and more complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than his, who lies beneath this funeral stone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pines, that murmur in low monotone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These walks frequented by scholastic feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were all his world; but in this calm retreat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him the Teacher's chair became a throne.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fond affection memory loves to dwell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the old days, when his example made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pastime of the toil of tongue and pen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, amid the groves he loved so well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That naught could lure him from their grateful shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sleeps, but wakes elsewhere, for God hath said, Amen!

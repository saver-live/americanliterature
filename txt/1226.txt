<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I attain to utter forth in verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some inward thought, my soul throbs audibly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along my pulses, yearning to be free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And something farther, fuller, higher, rehearse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the individual, true, and the universe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consummation of right harmony:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, like a wind-exposed distorted tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are blown against for ever by the curse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which breathes through Nature. Oh, the world is weak!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effluence of each is false to all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what we best conceive we fail to speak.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, soul, until thine ashen garments fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then resume thy broken strains, and seek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fit peroration without let or thrall.
</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five months ago the stream did flow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lilies bloomed within the sedge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we were lingering to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where none will track thee in this snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the stream, beside the hedge.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Sweet, be free to love and go!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if I do not hear thy foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frozen river is as mute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers have dried down to the root:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why, since these be changed since May,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouldst thou change less than they.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slow, slow as the winter snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears have drifted to mine eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my poor cheeks, five months ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set blushing at thy praises so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put paleness on for a disguise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Sweet, be free to praise and go!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if my face is turned too pale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thine oath that first did fail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thy love proved false and frail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why, since these be changed enow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I change less than thou.

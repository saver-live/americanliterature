<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak low to me, my Saviour, low and sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out the hallelujahs, sweet and low
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest I should fear and fall, and miss Thee so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who art not missed by any that entreat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak to mo as to Mary at thy feet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if no precious gums my hands bestow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let my tears drop like amber while I go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reach of thy divinest voice complete
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In humanest affection, thus, in sooth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose the sense of losing. As a child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose song-bird seeks the wood for evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sung to in its stead by mother's mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, sinking on her breast, love-reconciled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sleeps the faster that he wept before.
</pre>

<p>Oh, I've not locked the door,<br> I've not lit the candles,<br> You know I'm too tired<br> To think of sleep.<br> <br> See, how the fields die down,<br> In the sunset gloom of firs,<br> And I'm drunk on the sound<br> Of your voice, echoing here.<br> <br> It's fine, that all's black,<br> That life's – a cursed hell.<br> O, that you'd come back –<br> I was so certain, as well.<br></p>

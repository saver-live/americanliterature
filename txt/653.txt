<p>I climbed west on Incense Cloud Peak.<br> South I saw the spray-filled falls<br> Dropping for ten thousand feet<br> Sounding in a hundred gorges,<br> Suddenly as if lightning shone,<br> Strange as if light-wet rainbows lifted.<br> I thought the Milky Way had shattered,<br> Scattering stars through the clouds, downwards.<br> <br> Looking up an even greater force.<br> Nature's powers are so intense.<br> The Cosmic Wind blows there without stop.<br> The river's moon echoes back the light<br> Into vortices where waters rush.<br> On both sides the clear walls were washed,<br> By streams of pearl broken into mist,<br> By clouds of foam whitening over rock.<br> <br> Let me reach those Sublime Hills<br> Where peace comes to the quiet heart.<br> No more need to find the magic cup.<br> I'll wash the dust, there, from my face,<br> And live in those regions that I love,<br> Separated from the Human World. <br></p>

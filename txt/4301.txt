<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman! when I behold thee flippant, vain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inconstant, childish, proud, and full of fancies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without that modest softening that enhances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The downcast eye, repentant of the pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That its mild light creates to heal again:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en then, elate, my spirit leaps, and prances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en then my soul with exultation dances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that to love, so long, I've dormant lain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I see thee meek, and kind, and tender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavens! how desperately do I adore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy winning graces; to be thy defender
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hotly burn to be a Calidore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very Red Cross Knight a stout Leander
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might I be loved by thee like these of yore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light feet, dark violet eyes, and parted hair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft dimpled hands, white neck, and creamy breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are things on which the dazzled senses rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the fond, fixed eyes, forget they stare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From such fine pictures, heavens! I cannot dare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To turn my admiration, though unpossess'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They be of what is worthy, though not drest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lovely modesty, and virtues rare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet these I leave as thoughtless as a lark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lures I straight forget e'en ere I dine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thrice my palate moisten: but when I mark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such charms with mild intelligences shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ear is open like a greedy shark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch the tunings of a voice divine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! who can e'er forget so fair a being?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can forget her half retiring sweets?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God! she is like a milk-white lamb that bleats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For man's protection. Surely the All-seeing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will never give him pinions, who intreats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such innocence to ruin, who vilely cheats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dove-like bosom. In truth there is no freeing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One's thoughts from such a beauty; when I hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lay that once I saw her hand awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her form seems floating palpable, and near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I e'er seen her from an arbour take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dewy flower, oft would that hand appear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er my eyes the trembling moisture shake.

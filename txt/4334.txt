<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drear-nighted December,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too happy, happy tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy branches ne'er remember
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their green felicity:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The north cannot undo them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sleety whistle through them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor frozen thawings glue them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From budding at the prime.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drear-nighted December,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too happy, happy brook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy bubblings ne'er remember
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo's summer look;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with a sweet forgetting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stay their crystal fretting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never, never petting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the frozen time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! would 'twere so with many
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle girl and boy!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But were there ever any
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writhed not at passed joy?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feel of not to feel it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is none to heal it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor numbed sense to steel it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was never said in rhyme.
</pre>

<em>For Graves at Pea Ridge, Arkansas<em>!

Let none misgive we died amiss
  When here we strove in furious fight:
Furious it was; nathless was this
  Better than tranquil plight,
And tame surrender of the Cause
Hallowed by hearts and by the laws.
  We here who warred for Man and Right,
The choice of warring never laid with us.
  There we were ruled by the traitor's choice.
  Nor long we stood to trim and poise,
But marched and fellâ€”victorious!

<p> I long to go over there to the further bank of the river,<br> Where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line;<br> Where men cross over in their boats in the morning with ploughs on their shoulders to till their far-away fields;<br> Where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the riverside pasture;<br> Whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds,<br> Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferry when I am grown up.<br> They say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank,<br> Where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and thick reeds grow round the margins where waterbirds lay their eggs;<br> Where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny footprints upon the clean soft mud;<br> Where in the evening the tall grasses crested with white flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves.<br> Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when I am grown up.<br> I shall cross and cross back from bank to bank, and all the boys and girls of the village will wonder at me while they are bathing.<br> When the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon, I shall come running to you, saying, "Mother, I am hungry!"<br> When the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees, I shall come back in the dusk.<br> I shall never go away from you into the town to work like father.<br> Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman of the ferryboat when I am grown up.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Had this thought awhile ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My darling cannot understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have done, or what would do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this blind bitter land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I grew weary of the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until my thoughts cleared up again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering that the best I have done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was done to make it plain;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That every year I have cried, At length
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My darling understands it all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I have come into my strength,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And words obey my call.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had she done so who can say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would have shaken from the sieve?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might have thrown poor words away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And been content to live.

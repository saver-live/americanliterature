<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been in the meadows all the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gathered there the nosegay that you see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing within myself as bird or bee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When such do field-work on a morn of May.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, now I look upon my flowers, decay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has met them in my hands more fatally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because more warmly clasped, and sobs are free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come instead of songs. What do you say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet counsellors, dear friends? that I should go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back straightway to the fields and gather more?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another, sooth, may do it, but not I!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is very tired, my strength is low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hands are full of blossoms plucked before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held dead within them till myself shall die.

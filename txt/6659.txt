<p><cite class="al-title">Directions for Cooking by Troops, for Camp and Hospital</cite> (1861) was written by Florence Nightingale, the reputed founder of modern nursing, who gained her reputation mobilized nursing teams during the Crimean War of 1853-56 in Europe. It's subtitle, "Prepared for the Virginia Army" leads readers to believe that the recipes and treatment advice benefited the Confederacy; less clear is whether Union forces considered Ms. Nightingale's work. An interesting artifact of America's history preparing food, particularly during wartime.</p><p>This book is featured in our collection of <a href="/civil-war-stories">Civil War Stories</a> and <a href="/foodie-stories#foodie-books">Foodie Books &amp; Wartime Recipes</a></p><p><img alt="Regimental Commissary 1860-65" title="Regimental Commissary 1860-65" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/regimental-commissary-1860-65.jpg" style="max-width:400px; float:left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="216226703" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p><p><a href="directions-for-cooking-in-camp">Directions for Cooking in Camp</a></p><p><a href="directions-for-cooking-in-hospital">Directions for Cooking in Hospital</a></p><p><a href="taking-food">Taking Food</a></p><p><a href="what-food">What Food</a></p><p><a href="end-notes">End Notes</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/florence-nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a> library. </p>

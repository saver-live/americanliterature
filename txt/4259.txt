&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I laugh to-night? No voice will tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No God, no Demon of severe response,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deigns to reply from Heaven or from Hell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to my human heart I turn at once:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart! Thou and I are here sad and alone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, why did I laugh? O mortal pain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Darkness! Darkness! ever must I moan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To question Heaven and Hell and Heart in vain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I laugh? I know this Being's lease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fancy to its utmost blisses spreads;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet would I on this very midnight cease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world's gaudy ensigns see in shreds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verse, Fame, and Beauty are intense indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Death intenser, Death is Life's high meed.

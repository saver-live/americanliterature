<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to drive away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembrance from my eyes? for they have seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, an hour ago, my brilliant Queen!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch has a memory. O say, love, say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I do to kill it and be free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my old liberty?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When every fair one that I saw was fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough to catch me in but half a snare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not keep me there:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, howe'er poor or particolour'd things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My muse had wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever ready was to take her course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whither I bent her force,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unintellectual, yet divine to me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine, I say! What sea-bird o'er the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a philosopher the while he goes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winging along where the great water throes?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall I do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get anew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those moulted feathers, and so mount once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reach of fluttering Love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make him cower lowly while I soar?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I gulp wine? No, that is vulgarism,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heresy and schism,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foisted into the canon law of love;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, wine is only sweet to happy men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More dismal cares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seize on me unawares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shall I learn to get my peace again?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To banish thoughts of that most hateful land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dungeoner of my friends, that wicked strand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they were wreck'd and live a wrecked life;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That monstrous region, whose dull rivers pour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever from their sordid urns unto the shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unown'd of any weedy-haired gods;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose winds, all zephyrless, hold scourging rods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iced in the great lakes, to afflict mankind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose rank-grown forests, frosted, black, and blind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would fright a Dryad; whose harsh herbag'd meads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make lean and lank the starv'd ox while he feeds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There flowers have no scent, birds no sweet song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And great unerring Nature once seems wrong.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, for some sunny spell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dissipate the shadows of this hell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say they are gone, with the new dawning light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps forth my lady bright!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, let me once more rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul upon that dazzling breast!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let once again these aching arms be plac'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tender gaolers of thy waist!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me feel that warm breath here and there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spread a rapture in my very hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, the sweetness of the pain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me those lips again!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough! Enough! it is enough for me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dream of thee!

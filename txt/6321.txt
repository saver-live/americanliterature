Ha, ha, gods and kings; fill high, one and all;
Drink, drink! shout and drink! mad respond to
    the call!
Fill fast, and fill full; 'gainst the goblet ne'er
    sin;
Quaff there, at high tide, to the uttermost
    rim:—
      Flood-tide, and soul-tide to the brim!
Who with wine in him fears? who thinks of his
  cares?
Who sighs to be wise, when wine in him flares?
Water sinks down below, in currents full slow;
But wine mounts on high with its genial glow:—
      Welling up, till the brain overflow!
As the spheres, with a roll, some fiery of soul,
Others golden, with music, revolve round the
    pole;
So let our cups, radiant with many hued wines,
Round and round in groups circle, our Zodiac's
    Signs:—
      Round reeling, and ringing their chimes!
Then drink, gods and kings; wine merriment
    brings;
It bounds through the veins; there, jubilant
    sings.
Let it ebb, then, and flow; wine never grows
    dim;
Drain down that bright tide at the foam beaded
    rim:—
      Fill up, every cup, to the brim!

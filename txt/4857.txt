&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we feared The Beast, when he followed us we ran,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran very fast though we knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not right that The Beast should master Man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what could we Flint-workers do?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beast only grinned at our spears round his ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grinned at the hammers that we made;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now we will hunt him for the life with the Knife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the Buyer of the Blade!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room for his shadow on the grass, let it pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To left and right, stand clear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Buyer of the Blade, be afraid!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the great god Tyr!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyr thought hard till he hammered out a plan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he knew it was not right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And it is not right) that The Beast should master Man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he went to the Children of the Night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He begged a Magic Knife of their make for our sake.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he begged for the Knife they said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the Knife you would buy is an eye!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was the price he paid.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell it to the Barrows of the Dead, run ahead!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shout it so the Womens Side can hear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Buyer of the Blade, be afraid!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the great god Tyr!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our women and our little ones may walk on the Chalk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we can see them and beyond.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not be anxious for our sheep when we keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tally at the shearing-pond.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can eat with both our elbows on our knees, if we please,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can sleep after meals in the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Shepherd of the Twilight is dismayed at the Blade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feet-in-the-Night have run!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog-without-a-Master goes away (Hai, Tyr, aie!),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil-in-the-Dusk has run!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room for his shadow on the grass, let it pass!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To left and right, stand clear!.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Buyer of the Blade, be afraid!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the great god Tyr!

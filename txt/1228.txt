<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sow the glebe, we reap the corn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We build the house where we may rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, at moments, suddenly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look up to the great wide sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquiring wherefore we were born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For earnest or for jest?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senses folding thick and dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the stifled soul within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We guess diviner things beyond,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yearn to them with yearning fond;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strike out blindly to a mark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believed in, but not seen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We vibrate to the pant and thrill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith Eternity has curled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In serpent-twine about Gods seat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, freshening upward to His feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gradual growth His full-leaved will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expands from world to world.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in the tumult and excess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of act and passion under sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sometimes hear, oh, soft and far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As silver star did touch with star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kiss of Peace and Righteousness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all things that are done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God keeps His holy mysteries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just on the outside of mans dream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In diapason slow, we think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear their pinions rise and sink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they float pure beneath His eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like swans adown a stream.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstractions, are they, from the forms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of His great beauty? exaltations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From His great glory? strong previsions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what we shall be? intuitions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what we are, in calms and storms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond our peace and passions?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things nameless! which, in passing so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do stroke us with a subtle grace.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say, Who passes? they are dumb.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot see them go or come:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their touches fall soft, cold, as snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a blind mans face.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, touching so, they draw above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our common thoughts to Heavens unknown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our daily joy and pain advance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a divine significance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our human love, O mortal love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That light is not its own!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes horror chills our blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be so near such mystic Things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we wrap round us for defence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our purple manners, moods of sense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As angels from the face of God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand hidden in their wings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes through lifes heavy swound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We grope for them! with strangled breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stretch our hands abroad and try
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach them in our agony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And widen, so, the broad life-wound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which soon is large enough for death.

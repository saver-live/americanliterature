<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Danann children laugh, in cradles of wrought gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clap their hands together, and half close their eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they will ride the North when the ger-eagle flies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With heavy whitening wings, and a heart fallen cold:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kiss my wailing child and press it to my breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the narrow graves calling my child and me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desolate winds that cry over the wandering sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desolate winds that hover in the flaming West;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desolate winds that beat the doors of Heaven, and beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors of Hell and blow there many a whimpering ghost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O heart the winds have shaken; the unappeasable host
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is comelier than candles before MauryaÂ’s feet.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should the world be luckier if this house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where passion and precision have been one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time out of mind, became too ruinous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To breed the lidless eye that loves the sun?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where wings have memory of wings, and all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That comes of the best knit to the best? Although
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean roof-trees were the sturdier for its fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should their luck run high enough to reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gifts that govern men, and after these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gradual TimeÂ’s last gift, a written speech
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought of high laughter, loveliness and ease?

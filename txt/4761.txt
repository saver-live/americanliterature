<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all to whom this little book may come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health for yourselves and those you hold most dear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content abroad, and happiness at home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, one grand secret in your private ear:,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations have passed away and left no traces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And History gives the naked cause of it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One single, simple reason in all cases;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fell because their peoples were not fit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, though your Body be mis-shapen, blind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lame, feverish, lacking substance, power or skill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain it is that men can school the Mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To school the sickliest Body to her will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many have done, whose glory blazes still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like mighty flames in meanest lanterns lit:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore, we pray the crippled, weak and ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be fit, be fit! In mind at first be fit!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, though your Spirit seem uncouth or small,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stubborn as clay or shifting as the sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthen the Body, and the Body shall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthen the Spirit till she take command;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bold rider brings his horse in hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the tall fence, with voice and heel and bit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaps while all the field are at a stand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be fit, be fit! In body next be fit!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing on earth, no Arts, no Gifts, nor Graces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Fame, no Wealth, outweighs the want of it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Law which every law embraces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be fit, be fit! In mind and body befit!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The even heart that seldom slurs its beat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool head weighing what that heart desires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measuring eye that guides the hands and feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soul unbroken when the Body tires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the things our weary world requires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far more than superfluities of wit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore we pray you, sons of generous sires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be fit, be fit! For HonourÂ’s sake be fit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one lesson at all Times and Places,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One changeless Truth on all things changing writ,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For boys and girls, men, women, nations, races,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be fit, be fit! And once again, be fit!

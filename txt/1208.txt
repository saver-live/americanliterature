<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One eve it happened, when I sat alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, upon the terrace of my tower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book upon my knees to counterfeit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reading that I never read at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Marian, in the garden down below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt by the fountain I could just hear thrill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drowsy silence of the exhausted day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And peeled a new fig from that purple heap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the grass beside her, turning out the red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed her eager child (who sucked at it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With vehement lips across a gap of air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he stood opposite, face and curls a-flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that last sun-ray, crying "Give me, give,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stamping with imperious baby-feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're all born princes) something startled me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laugh of sad and innocent souls, that breaks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abruptly, as if frightened at itself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas Marian laughed. I saw her glance above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sudden shame that I should hear her laugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straightway dropped my eyes upon my book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knew, the first time, 'twas Boccaccio's tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Falcon's, of the lover who for love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroyed the best that loved him. Some of us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do it still, and then we sit and laugh no more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugh you, sweet Marian, you've the right to laugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since God Himself is for you, and a child!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me there's somewhat less, and so I sigh.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavens were making room to hold the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sevenfold heavens unfolding all their gates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let the stars out slowly (prophesied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In close-approaching advent, not discerned),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While still the cue-owls from the cypresses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Poggio called and counted every pulse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the skyey palpitation. Gradually
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple and transparent shadows slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had filled up the whole valley to the brim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flooded all the city, which you saw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some drowned city in some enchanted sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut off from nature, drawing you who gaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With passionate desire, to leap and plunge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And find a sea-king with a voice of waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And treacherous soft eyes, and slippery locks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot kiss but you shall bring away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their salt upon your lips. The duomo-bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strikes ten, as if it struck ten fathoms down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So deep; and twenty churches answer it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same, with twenty various instances.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some gaslights tremble along squares and streets;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pitti's palace-front is drawn in fire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, past the quays, Maria Novella Place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which the mystic obelisks stand up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triangular, pyramidal, each based
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its four-square brazen tortoises,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To guard that fair church, Buonarroti's Bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That stares out from her large blind dial-eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Her quadrant and armillary dials, black
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rhythms of many suns and moons) in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquiry for so rich a soul as his.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methinks I have plunged, I see it all so clear . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, O my heart, . . . the sea-king!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of waters. There he stood, my king!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt him, rather than beheld him. Up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rose, as if he were my king indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then sat down, in trouble at myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And struggling for my woman's empery.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis pitiful; but women are so made:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll die for you perhaps, 'tis probable;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we'll not spare you an inch of our full height:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll have our whole just stature, five feet four,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though laid out in our coffins: pitiful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, Romney! Lady Waldemar is here?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered in a voice which was not his.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have her letter; you shall read it soon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, I must be heard a little, I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have waited long and travelled far for that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you thought to have shut a tedious book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And farewell. Ah, you dog-eared such a page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here you find me."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he touch my hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or but my sleeve? I trembled, hand and foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have touched me. "Will you sit?" I asked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And motioned to a chair; but down he sat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little slowly, as a man in doubt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the couch beside me, couch and chair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being wheeled upon the terrace.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin Romney? this is wonderful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all is wonder on such summer-nights;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing should surprise us any more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who see that miracle of stars. Behold."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I signed above, where all the stars were out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if an urgent heat had started there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secret writing from a sombre page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blank, last moment, crowded suddenly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hurrying splendours.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you do not know"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He murmured.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I know," I said, "I know.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the news from Vincent Carrington.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I did not think you'd leave the work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England, for so much even, though of course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll make a work-day of your holiday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turn it to our Tuscan people's use,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who much need helping since the Austrian boar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(So bold to cross the Alp to Lombardy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dash his brute front unabashed against
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steep snow-bosses of that shield of God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who soon shall rise in wrath and shake it clear)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came hither also, raking up our grape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And olive gardens with his tyrannous tusk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rolling on our maize with all his swine."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You had the news from Vincent Carrington,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He echoed, picking up the phrase beyond,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he knew the rest was merely talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fill a gap and keep out a strong wind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You had, then, Vincent's personal news?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His own,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered. "All that ruined world of yours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems crumbling into marriage. Carrington
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has chosen wisely."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you take it so?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried, "and is it possible at last" . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused there, and then, inward to himself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too much at last, too late! yet certainly" . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And there his voice swayed as an Alpine plank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That feels a passionate torrent underneath)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The knowledge, had I known it first or last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could scarce have changed the actual case for me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And best for her at this time."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, I thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves Kate Ward, it seems, now, like a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has married Lady Waldemar!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Vincent's letter said how Leigh was moved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear that Vincent was betrothed to Kate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what cracked pitchers go we to deep wells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world! Then I spoke, "I did not think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin, you had ever known Kate Ward."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I never knew her. 'Tis enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Vincent did, and therefore chose his wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other reasons than those topaz eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've heard of. Not to undervalue them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all that. One takes up the world with eyes."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including Romney Leigh, I thought again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albeit he knows them only by repute.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How vile must all men be, since he's a man.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His deep pathetic voice, as if he guessed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not surely love him, took the word;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You never got a letter from Lord Howe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month back, dear Aurora?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"None," I said.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I felt it was so," he replied: "yet, strange!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Blaise Delorme has passed through Florence?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By chance I saw him in Our Lady's church
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I saw him, mark you, but he saw not me),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean-washed in holy water from the count
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of things terrestrial, letters, and the rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had crossed us out together with his sins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, strange; but only strange that good Lord Howe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferred him to the post because of pauls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me I'm sworn to never trust a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least with letters."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There were facts to tell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To smooth with eye and accent. Howe supposed . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, well, no matter! there was dubious need;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You heard the news from Vincent Carrington.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet perhaps you had been startled less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see me, dear Aurora, if you had read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That letter."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he sets me down as vexed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I've draped myself in woman's pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a perfect purpose. Oh, I'm vexed, it seems!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend Lord Howe deputes his friend Sir Blaise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To break as softly as a sparrow's egg
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lets a bird out tenderly, the news
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Romney's marriage to a certain saint;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To smooth with eye and accent, indicate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His possible presence. Excellently well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've played your part, my Lady Waldemar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I've played mine.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Romney," I began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You did not use, of old, to be so like
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Greek king coming from a taken Troy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas needful that precursors spread your path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With three-piled carpets, to receive your foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dull the sound of't. For myself, be sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it frankly grinds the gravel here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still can bear it. Yet I'm sorry too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose this famous letter, which Sir Blaise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has twisted to a lighter absently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fire some holy taper: dear Lord Howe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writes letters good for all things but to lose;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a flower of London gossipry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has dropped wherever such a stem broke off.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I feel that, lonely among my vines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nothing's talked of, save the blight again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no more Chianti! Still the letter's use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As preparation . . . . . Did I start indeed?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night I started at a cockchafer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook a half-hour after. Have you learnt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more of women, 'spite of privilege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than still to take account too seriously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such weak flutterings? Why, we like it, sir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get our powers and our effects that way:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees stand stiff and still at time of frost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no wind tears them; but, let summer come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When trees are happy, and a breath avails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set them trembling through a million leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In luxury of emotion. Something less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes to move a woman: let her start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shake at pleasure, nor conclude at yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter's bitter, but the summer's green."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered: "Be the summer ever green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With you, Aurora! though you sweep your sex
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With somewhat bitter gusts from where you live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above them, whirling downward from your heights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your very own pine-cones, in a grand disdain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lowland burrs with which you scatter them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So high and cold to others and yourself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little less to Romney were unjust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, I would not have you. Let it pass:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel content so. You can bear indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sudden step beside you: but for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould move me sore to hear your softened voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora's voice, if softened unaware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pity of what I am."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah friend, I thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As husband of the Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're granted very sorely pitiable!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet Aurora Leigh must guard her voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From softening in the pity of your case,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if from lie or license. Certainly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll soak up all the slush and soil of life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With softened voices, ere we come to you.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which I interrupted my own thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spoke out calmly. "Let us ponder, friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er our state we must have made it first;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though the thing displease us, ay, perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displease us warrantably, never doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That other states, thought possible once, and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejected by the instinct of our lives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If then adopted had displeased us more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than this in which the choice, the will, the love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has stamped the honour of a patent act
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From henceforth. What we choose may not be good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, that we choose it, proves it good for us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potentially, fantastically, now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or last year, rather than a thing we saw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw no need for choosing. Moths will burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wings, which proves that light is good for moths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who else had flown not where they agonise."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay, light is good," he echoed, and there paused;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then abruptly, . . . "Marian. Marian's well?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bowed my head but found no word. 'Twas hard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak of her to Lady Waldemar's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New husband. How much did he know, at last?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much? how little? He would take no sign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But straight repeated, "Marian. Is she well?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's well," I answered.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was there in sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour back, but the night had drawn her home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where still I heard her in an upper room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her low voice singing to the child in bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, restless with the summer-heat and play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slumber snatched at noon, was long sometimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In falling off, and took a score of songs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mother-hushes ere she saw him sound.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's well," I answered.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here?" he asked.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, here."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and sighed. "That shall be presently,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now this must be. I have words to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would be alone to say them, I with you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no third troubling."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak then," I returned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She will not vex you."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which, suddenly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his face upon me with its smile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to crush me. "I have read your book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have read it," I replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I have writ it, we have done with it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the rest?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rest is like the first,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, "for the book is in my heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives in me, wakes in me, and dreams in me:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My daily bread tastes of it, and my wine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which has no smack of it, I pour it out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems unnatural drinking."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitterly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the word up; "Never waste your wine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book lived in me ere it lived in you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it closer than another does,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how it's foolish, feeble, and afraid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all unworthy so much compliment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beseech you, keep your wine, and, when you drink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still wish some happier fortune to a friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than even to have written a far better book."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered gently, "That is consequent:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet looks beyond the book he has made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else he had not made it. If a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could make a man, he'd henceforth be a god
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In feeling what a little thing is man:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my case. And this special book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not make it, to make light of it:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands above my knowledge, draws me up;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis high to me. It may be that the book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not so high, but I so low, instead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still high to me. I mean no compliment:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not say there are not, young or old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male writers, ay, or female, let it pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who'll write us richer and completer books.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man may love a woman perfectly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet by no means ignorantly maintain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand women have not larger eyes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough that she alone has looked at him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes that, large or small, have won his soul.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, this book, Aurora, so, your book."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas," I answered, "is it so, indeed?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then was silent.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it so, indeed,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He echoed, "that alas is all your word?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "I'm thinking of a far-off June,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you and I, upon my birthday once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discoursed of life and art, with both untried.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm thinking, Romney, how 'twas morning then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now 'tis night."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now," he said, "'tis night."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm thinking," I resumed, "'tis somewhat sad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That if I had known, that morning in the dew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin Romney would have said such words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such a night at close of many years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking of a future book of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have pleased me better as a hope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than as an actual grace it can at all:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's sad, I'm thinking."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay," he said, "'tis night."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And there," I added lightly, "are the stars!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, we'll talk of stars and not of books."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have the stars," he murmured, "it is well:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be like them! shine, Aurora, on my dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though high and cold and only like a star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for this short night only, you, who keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Aurora of the bright June-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That withered up the flowers before my face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned me from the garden evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I was not worthy. Oh, deserved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deserved! that I, who verily had not learnt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's lesson half, attaining as a dunce
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To obliterate good words with fractious thumbs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cheat myself of the context, I should push
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside, with male ferocious impudence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world's Aurora who had conned her part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side the leaf! ignore her so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she was a woman and a queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had no beard to bristle through her song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teacher, who has taught me with a book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Miriam, whose sweet mouth, when nearly drowned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still heard singing on the shore! Deserved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That here I should look up unto the stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And miss the glory" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I understand?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I broke in. "You speak wildly, Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I hear wildly. In that morning-time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recollect, the roses were too red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees too green, reproach too natural
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one should see not what the other saw:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, it's night, remember; we have shades
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In place of colours; we are now grown cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And old, my cousin Romney. Pardon me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm very happy that you like my book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very sorry that I quoted back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ten years' birthday. 'Twas so mad a thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any woman, I scarce marvel much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You took it for a venturous piece of spite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provoking such excuses as indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot call you slack in."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered sadly, "something, if but so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night is softer than an English day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men may well come hither when they're sick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw in easier breath from larger air.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis thus with me; I come to you, to you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Italy of women, just to breathe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul out once before you, ere I go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As humble as God makes me at the last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I thank Him), quite out of the way of men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yours, Aurora, like a punished child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cheeks all blurred with tears and naughtiness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To silence in a corner. I am come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak, beloved" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wisely, cousin Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And worthily of us both!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, worthily;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this time I must speak out and confess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I, so truculent in assumption once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So absolute in dogma, proud in aim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fierce in expectation, I, who felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world tugging at my skirts for help,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if no other man than I could pull,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor woman but I led her by the hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor cloth hold but I had it in my coat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do know myself to-night for what I was
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that June-day, Aurora. Poor bright day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which meant the best . . . a woman and a rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And which I smote upon the cheek with words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it turned and rent me! Young you were,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That birthday, poet, but you talked the right:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I, . . . I built up follies like a wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To intercept the sunshine and your face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your face! that's worse."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak wisely, cousin Leigh."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, wisely, dear Aurora, though too late:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, not wisely. I was heavy then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stupid, and distracted with the cries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tortured prisoners in the polished brass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that Phalarian bull, society,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seems to bellow bravely like ten bulls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if you listen, moans and cries instead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despairingly, like victims tossed and gored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trampled by their hoofs. I heard the cries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too close: I could not hear the angels lift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fold of rustling air, nor what they said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help my pity. I beheld the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one great famishing carnivorous mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge, deserted, callow, blind bird Thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With piteous open beak that hurt my heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till down upon the filthy ground I dropped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tore the violets up to get the worms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worms, worms, was all my cry: an open mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gross want, bread to fill it to the lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more. That poor men narrowed their demands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such an end, was virtue, I supposed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjudicating that to see it so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was reason. Oh, I did not push the case
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up higher, and ponder how it answers when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich take up the same cry for themselves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professing equally, 'An open mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gross need, food to fill us, and no more.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why that's so far from virtue, only vice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can find excuse for't! that makes libertines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slurs our cruel streets from end to end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eighty thousand women in one smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who only smile at night beneath the gas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body's satisfaction and no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is used for argument against the soul's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here too; the want, here too, implies the right.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How dark I stood that morning in the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My best Aurora (though I saw your eyes),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first you told me . . . oh, I recollect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound, and how you lifted your small hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how your white dress and your burnished curls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went greatening round you in the still blue air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if an inspiration from within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had blown them all out when you spoke the words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even these, 'You will not compass your poor ends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Of barley-feeding and material ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Without the poet's individualism
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To work your universal. It takes a soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To move a body, it takes a high-souled man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To move the masses, even to a cleaner stye:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It takes the ideal, to blow an inch inside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The dust of the actual: and your Fouriers failed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because not poets enough to understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That life develops from within.' I say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your words, I could say other words of yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For none of all your words will let me go;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sweet verbena which, being brushed against,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will hold us three hours after by the smell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of long walks upon windy hills.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these words dealt in sharper perfume, these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were ever on me, stinging through my dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saying themselves for ever o'er my acts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some unhappy verdict. That I failed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is certain. Stye or no stye, to contrive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swine's propulsion toward the precipice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proved easy and plain. I subtly organised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ordered, built the cards up high and higher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, some one breathing, all fell flat again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In setting right society's wide wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere life's so fatal. So I failed indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, twice, and oftener, hearing through the rents
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of obstinate purpose, still those words of yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You will not compass your poor ends, not you!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But harder than you said them; every time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still farther from your voice, until they came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcrow me with triumphant scorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which vexed me to resistance. Set down this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For condemnation, I was guilty here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood upon my deed and fought my doubt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men will, for I doubted, till at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My deed gave way beneath me suddenly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left me what I am: the curtain dropped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My part quite ended, all the footlights quenched,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own soul hissing at me through the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ready for confession, I was wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've sorely failed, I've slipped the ends of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I yield, you have conquered."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay," I answered him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've something for your hearing, also. I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have failed too."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" he said, "you're very great;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sadness of your greatness fits you well:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the plume upon a hero's casque
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should nod a shadow upon his victor face."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took him up austerely, "You have read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My book, but not my heart; for recollect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a writ in Sanscrit, which you bungle at.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've surely failed, I know, if failure means
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look back sadly on work gladly done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wander on my Mountains of Delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So called (I can remember a friend's words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as you, sir), weary and in want
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of even a sheep-path, thinking bitterly . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, well! no matter. I but say so much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep you, Romney Leigh, from saying more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let you feel I am not so high indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I can bear to have you at my foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or safe, that I can help you. That June-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too deeply sunk in craterous sunsets now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you or me to dig it up alive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pluck it out all bleeding with spent flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the roots, before those moralising stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got instead, that poor lost day, you said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some words as truthful as the thing of mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cared to keep in memory; and I hold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I, that day, and being the girl I was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had shown a gentler spirit, less arrogance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had not hurt me. You will scarce mistake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point here: I but only think, you see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More justly, that's more humbly, of myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when I tried a crown on and supposed . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, laugh, sir, I'll laugh with you! pray you, laugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've had so many birthdays since that day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've learnt to prize mirth's opportunities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which come too seldom. Was it you who said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not changed? the same Aurora? Ah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could laugh there, too! Why, Ulysses' dog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew him, and wagged his tail and died: but if
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had owned a dog, I too, before my Troy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you brought him here, . . . I warrant you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd look into my face, bark lustily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And live on stoutly, as the creatures will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose spirits are not troubled by long loves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dog would never know me, I'm so changed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less a friend . . . except that you're misled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the colour of the hair, the trick of the voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like that Aurora Leigh's."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet trick of voice!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be a dog for this, to know it at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And die upon the falls of it. O love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O best Aurora! are you then so sad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You scarcely had been sadder as my wife?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your wife, sir! I must certainly be changed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I, Aurora, can have said a thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So light, it catches at the knightly spurs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a noble gentleman like Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trips him from his honourable sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what befits" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You wholly misconceive,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I returned, "I'm glad of it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But keep from misconception, too, yourself:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not humbled to so low a point,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so far saddened. If I am sad at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten layers of birthdays on a woman's head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are apt to fossilise her girlish mirth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though ne'er so merry: I'm perforce more wise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that, in truth, means sadder. For the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look here, sir: I was right upon the whole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That birthday morning. 'Tis impossible
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get at men excepting through their souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However open their carnivorous jaws;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poets get directlier at the soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any of your oeconomists for which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must not overlook the poet's work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When scheming for the world's necessities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul's the way. Not even Christ Himself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can save man else than as He holds man's soul;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore did He come into our flesh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some wise hunter creeping on his knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a torch, into the blackness of a cave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To face and quell the beast there take the soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so possess the whole man, body and soul.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, so far, right, yes: not farther, though:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We both were wrong that June-day both as wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an east wind had been. I who talked of art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you who grieved for all men's griefs . . . what then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We surely made too small a part for God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these things. What we are, imports us more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than what we eat; and life, you've granted me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develops from within. But innermost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the inmost, most interior of the interne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God claims His own, Divine humanity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renewing nature, or the piercingest verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressed in by subtlest poet, still must keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much upon the outside of a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the very bowl in which he dips his beard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, . . . the rest; I cannot surely speak:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I doubt more than you doubted then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I the poet's veritable charge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have borne upon my forehead. If I have,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might feel somewhat liker to a crown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foolish green one even. Ah, I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chiefly when the sun shines, that I've failed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what then, Romney? Though we fail indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You . . . I . . . a score of such weak workers, . . . He
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fails never. If He cannot work by us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will work over us. Does He want a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less a woman, think you? Every time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star winks there, so many souls are born,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who all shall work too. Let our own be calm:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be ashamed to sit beneath those stars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impatient that we're nothing."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Could we sit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just so for ever, sweetest friend," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My failure would seem better than success.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet indeed your book has dealt with me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More gently, cousin, than you ever will!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your book brought down entire the bright June-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set me wandering in the garden-walks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me watch the garland in a place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You blushed so . . . nay, forgive me, do not stir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only thank the book for what it taught,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what permitted. Poet, doubt yourself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never doubt that you're a poet to me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From henceforth. You have written poems, sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which moved me in secret, as the sap is moved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In still March-branches, signless as a stone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this last book o'ercame me like soft rain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which falls at midnight, when the tightened bark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks out into unhesitating buds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sudden protestations of the spring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all your other books, I saw but you:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man may see the moon so, in a pond,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not be nearer therefore to the moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor use the sight . . . except to drown himself:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I forced my heart back from the sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what had I, I thought, to do with her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora . . . Romney? But, in this last book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You showed me something separate from yourself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond you, and I bore to take it in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let it draw me. You have shown me truths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O June-day friend, that help me now at night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When June is over! truths not yours, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But set within my reach by means of you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presented by your voice and verse the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take them clearest. Verily I was wrong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And verily many thinkers of this age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, many Christian teachers, half in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are wrong in just my sense who understood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our natural world too insularly, as if
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No spiritual counterpart completed it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consummating its meaning, rounding all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To justice and perfection, line by line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Form by form, nothing single nor alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great below clenched by the great above,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shade here authenticating substance there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body proving spirit, as the effect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause: we meantime being too grossly apt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold the natural, as dogs a bone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Though reason and nature beat us in the face),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So obstinately, that we'll break our teeth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or ever we let go. For everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're too materialistic, eating clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Like men of the west) instead of Adam's corn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Noah's wine clay by handfuls, clay by lumps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we're filled up to the throat with clay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grow the grimy colour of the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which we are feeding. Ay, materialist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age's name is. God Himself, with some,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is apprehended as the bare result
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what His hand materially has made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressed in such an algebraic sign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called God that is, to put it otherwise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They add up nature to a nought of God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cross the quotient. There are many even,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose names are written in the Christian Church
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To no dishonour, diet still on mud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And splash the altars with it. You might think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clay Christ laid upon their eyelids when,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still blind, He called them to the use of sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remained there to retard its exercise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With clogging incrustations. Close to heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They see for mysteries, through the open doors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vague puffs of smoke from pots of earthenware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fain would enter, when their time shall come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With quite another body than Saint Paul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has promised husk and chaff, the whole barley-corn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or where's the resurrection?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus it is,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sighed. And he resumed with mournful face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning so, and filling up with clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wards of this great key, the natural world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fumbling vainly therefore at the lock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the spiritual, we feel ourselves shut in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the wild-beast roar of struggling life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrors and compunctions of our souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As saints with lions, we who are not saints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have no heavenly lordship in our stare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To awe them backward. Ay, we are forced, so pent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To judge the whole too partially, . . . confound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions. Is there any common phrase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant, with the adverb heard alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The verb being absent, and the pronoun out?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we, distracted in the roar of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still insolently at God's adverb snatch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bruit against Him that His thought is void,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His meaning hopeless, cry, that everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is slipping from His hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless some other Christ (say Romney Leigh)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come up and toil and moil and change the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the First has proved inadequate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we talk bigly of His work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And piously of His person. We blaspheme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, to finish our doxology,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despairing on the earth for which He died."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So now," I asked, "you have more hope of men?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope," he answered. "I am come to think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That God will have His work done, as you said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that we need not be disturbed too much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Romney Leigh or others having failed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this or that quack nostrum recipes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For keeping summits by annulling depths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wrestling with luxurious lounging sleeves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And acting heroism without a scratch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fail, what then? Aurora, if I smiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see you, in your lovely morning-pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try on the poet's wreath which suits the noon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Sweet cousin, walls must get the weather stain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they grow the ivy!), certainly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood myself there worthier of contempt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-rated, in disastrous arrogance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As competent to sorrow for mankind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even their odds. A man may well despair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who counts himself so needful to success.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I failed: I throw the remedy back on God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sit down here beside you, in good hope."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And yet take heed," I answered, "lest we lean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too dangerously on the other side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so fail twice. Be sure, no earnest work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of any honest creature, howbeit weak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperfect, ill-adapted, fails so much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not gathered as a grain of sand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enlarge the sum of human action used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For carrying out God's end. No creature works
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So ill, observe, that therefore he's cashiered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honest, earnest man must stand and work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman also otherwise she drops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At once below the dignity of man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting serfdom. Free men freely work.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever fears God, fears to sit at ease."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried: "True. After Adam, work was curse:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural creature labours, sweats, and frets.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, after Christ, work turns to privilege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And henceforth, one with our humanity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Six-day Worker working still in us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has called us freely to work on with Him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In high companionship. So, happiest!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I count that heaven itself is only work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a surer issue. Let us work, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no more work as Adam, nor as Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erewhile, as if the only man on earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible for all the thistles blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tigers couchant, struggling in amaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against disease and winter, snarling on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever that the world's not paradise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O cousin, let us be content, in work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do the thing we can, and not presume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fret because it's little. 'Twill employ
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven men, they say, to make a perfect pin:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who makes the head, content to miss the point;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who makes the point, agreed to leave the join:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if a man should cry 'I want a pin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And I must make it straightway, head and point,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wisdom is not worth the pin he wants
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven men to a pin, and not a man too much!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven generations, haply, to this world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To right it visibly a finger's breadth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mend its rents a little. Oh, to storm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And say 'This world here is intolerable;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I will not eat this corn, nor drink this wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nor love this woman, flinging her my soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Without a bond for't as a lover should,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nor use the generous leave of happiness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As not too good for using generously'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Since virtue kindles at the touch of joy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a man's cheek laid on a woman's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God, Who knows it, looks for quick returns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From joys) to stand and claim to have a life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the bounds of the individual man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And raze all personal cloisters of the soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build up public stores and magazines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if God's creatures otherwise were lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The builder surely saved by any means!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think, I have a pattern on my nail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will carve the world new after it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And solve so these hard social questions nay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible social questions, since their roots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike deep in Evil's own existence here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which God permits because the question's hard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To abolish evil nor attaint free-will.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, hard to God, but not to Romney Leigh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Romney has a pattern on his nail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Whatever may be lacking on the Mount),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, not being over-nice to separate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's element from what's convention, hastes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By line on line to draw you out a world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without your help indeed, unless you take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His yoke upon you, and will learn of him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much he has to teach! so good a world!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same the whole creation's groaning for!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No rich nor poor, no gain nor loss nor stint;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pottage in it able to exclude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brother's birthright, and no right of birth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pottage both secured to every man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And perfect virtue dealt out like the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gratuitously, with the soup at six,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whoso does not seek it."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Softly, sir,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I interrupted, "I had a cousin once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I held in reverence. If he strained too wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not to take honour, but give help;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gesture was heroic. If his hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accomplished nothing . . . (well, it is not proved)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That empty hand thrown impotently out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were sooner caught, I think, by One in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than many a hand that reaped a harvest in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keeps the scythe's glow on it. Pray you, then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my sake merely, use less bitterness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking of my cousin."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora! when the prophet beats the ass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel intercedes." He shook his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And yet to mean so well and fail so foul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expresses ne'er another beast than man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The antithesis is human. Hearken, dear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's too much abstract willing, purposing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this poor world. We talk by aggregates,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think by systems, and, being used to face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our evils in statistics, are inclined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cap them with unreal remedies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn out in haste on the other side the slate."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's true," I answered, fain to throw up thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make a game of't. "Yes, we generalise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough to please you. If we pray at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray no longer for our daily bread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But next centenary's harvests. If we give,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cup of water is not tendered till
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lay down pipes and found a Company
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Branches. Ass or angel, 'tis the same:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman cannot do the thing she ought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means whatever perfect thing she can,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In life, in art, in science, but she fears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let the perfect action take her part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rest there: she must prove what she can do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she does it, prate of woman's rights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of woman's mission, woman's function, till
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men (who are prating too on their side) cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A woman's function plainly is . . . to talk.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor souls, they are very reasonably vexed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot hear each other talk."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An artist, judge so?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, an artist yes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, precisely, I'm an artist, sir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And woman, if another sat in sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd whisper, Soft, my sister! not a word!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By speaking we prove only we can speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he, the man here, never doubted. What
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doubts is, whether we can do the thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With decent grace we've not yet done at all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, do it; bring your statue, you have room!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll see it even by the starlight here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if 'tis e'er so little like the god
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who looks out from the marble silently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the track of his own shining dart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dusk of ages, there's no need to speak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universe shall henceforth speak for you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And witness, 'She who did this thing was born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do it claims her license in her work.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so with more works. Whoso cures the plague,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though twice a woman, shall be called a leech:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who rights a land's finances is excused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For touching coppers, though her hands be white.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we, we talk!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the age's mood,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said; "we boast, and do not. We put up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hostelry signs where'er we lodge a day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some red colossal cow with mighty paps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Cyclops' fingers could not strain to milk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then bring out presently our saucerful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of curds. We want more quiet in our works,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More knowledge of the bounds in which we work;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More knowledge that each individual man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remains an Adam to the general race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constrained to see, like Adam, that he keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His personal state's condition honestly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or vain all thoughts of his to help the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which still must be developed from its one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If bettered in its many. We indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who think to lay it out new like a park,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take a work on us which is not man's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For God alone sits far enough above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speculate so largely. None of us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Not Romney Leigh) is mad enough to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll have a grove of oaks upon that slope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sink the need of acorns. Government,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If veritable and lawful, is not given
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By imposition of the foreign hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor chosen from a pretty pattern-book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some domestic idealogue who sits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And coldly chooses empire, where as well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might republic. Genuine government
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but the expression of a nation, good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or less good even as all society,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe'er unequal, monstrous, crazed and cursed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but the expression of men's single lives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud sum of the silent units. What,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'd change the aggregate and yet retain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each separate figure? whom do we cheat by that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, not even Romney."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cousin, you are sad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did all your social labour at Leigh Hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And elsewhere, come to nought, then?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was nought,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered mildly. "There is room, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For statues still in this large world of God's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not for vacuums; so I am not sad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sadder than is good for what I am.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My vain phalanstery dissolved itself;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My men and women of disordered lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought in orderly to dine and sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke up those waxen masks I made them wear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fierce contortions of the natural face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cursed me for my tyrannous constraint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In forcing crooked creatures to live straight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set the country hounds upon my back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bite and tear me for my wicked deed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of trying to do good without the church
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or even the squires, Aurora. Do you mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ancient neighbours? The great book-club teems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 'sketches,' 'summaries,' and 'last tracts' but twelve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On socialistic troublers of close bonds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt the generous rich and grateful poor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vicar preached from 'Revelations' (till
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor woke), and found me with 'the frogs'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On three successive Sundays; ay, and stopped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To weep a little (for he's getting old)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such perdition should o'ertake a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such fair acres in the parish, too!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He printed his discourses 'by request,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if your book shall sell as his did, then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your verses are less good than I suppose.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women of the neighbourhood subscribed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sent me a copy, bound in scarlet silk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tooled edges, blazoned with the arms of Leigh:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I own that touched me."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, the pretty ones?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Romney!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Otherwise the effect was small:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had my windows broken once or twice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By liberal peasants naturally incensed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At such a vexer of Arcadian peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would not let men call their wives their own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kick like Britons, and made obstacles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When things went smoothly as a baby drugged,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward freedom and starvation bringing down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wicked London tavern-thieves and drabs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To affront the blessed hillside drabs and thieves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mended morals, quotha fine new lives!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My windows paid for't. I was shot at, once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an active poacher who had hit a hare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other barrel (tired of springeing game
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long upon my acres, undisturbed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And restless for the country's virtue yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He missed me); ay, and pelted very oft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In riding through the village. 'There he goes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Who'd drive away our Christian gentlefolk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To catch us undefended in the trap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He baits with poisonous cheese, and lock us up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In that pernicious prison of Leigh Hall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With all his murderers! Give another name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And say Leigh Hell, and burn it up with fire.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they did, at last, Aurora."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You never heard it, cousin? Vincent's news
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came stinted, then."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They did? they burnt Leigh Hall?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're sorry, dear Aurora? Yes, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did it perfectly: a thorough work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a failure, this time. Let us grant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis somewhat easier, though, to burn a house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than build a system; yet that's easy too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dream. Books, pictures ay, the pictures! What,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think your dear Vandykes would give them pause?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proud ancestral Leighs, with those peaked beards,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or bosoms white as foam thrown up on rocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the old-spent wave. Such calm defiant looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They flared up with! now nevermore to twit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones in the family vault with ugly death.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one was rescued, save the Lady Maud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who threw you down, that morning you were born,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undeniable lineal mouth and chin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wear for ever for her gracious sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which good deed I saved her; the rest went:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you, you're sorry, cousin. Well, for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all my phalansterians safely out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Poor hearts, they helped the burners, it was said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certainly a few clapped hands and yelled),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruin did not hurt me as it might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when for instance I was hurt one day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain letter being destroyed. In fact,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the great house flare so . . . oaken floors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fathers made so fine with rushes once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before our mothers furbished them with trains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carved wainscots, panelled walls, the favourite slide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For draining off a martyr (or a rogue),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The echoing galleries, half a half-mile long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the various stairs that took you up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took you down, and took you round about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon their slippery darkness, recollect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All helping to keep up one blazing jest!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames through all the casements pushing forth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like red-hot devils crinkled into snakes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All signifying 'Look you, Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We save the people from your saving, here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yet so as by fire! we make a pretty show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Besides and that's the best you've ever done.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see this, almost moved myself to clap!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'vale et plaude' came too with effect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the roof fell, and the fire that paused,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stunned momently beneath the stroke of slates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tumbling rafters, rose at once and roared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrapping the whole house (which disappeared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mounting whirlwind of dilated flame),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew upward, straight, its drift of fiery chaff
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Heaven, which blenched, and ran up higher."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor Romney!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes when I dream," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hear the silence after, 'twas so still.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all those wild beasts, yelling, cursing round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were suddenly silent, while you counted five,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So silent, that you heard a young bird fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the top nest in the neighbouring rookery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through edging over-rashly toward the light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old rooks had already fled too far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear the screech they fled with, though you saw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some flying still, like scatterings of dead leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In autumn-gusts, seen dark against the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All flying, ousted, like the House of Leigh."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Romney!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evidently 'twould have been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine sight for a poet, sweet, like you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the verse blaze after. I myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even I, felt something in the grand old trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which stood that moment like brute Druid gods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazed upon the rim of ruin, where,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As into a blackened socket, the great fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had dropped, still throwing up splinters now and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show them grey with all their centuries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left there to witness that on such a day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House went out."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While you counted five,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seemed to feel a little like a Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then it passed, Aurora. A child cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I had enough to think of what to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all those houseless wretches in the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ponder where they'd dance the next time, they
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had burnt the viol."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you think of that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who burns his viol will not dance, I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cymbals, Romney."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O my sweet, sad voice!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried, "O voice that speaks and overcomes!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is silent, but Aurora speaks."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas," I said, "I speak I know not what:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm back in childhood, thinking as a child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A foolish fancy will it make you smile?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not from the window of my room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch sight of those old chimneys any more."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more," he answered. "If you pushed one day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the green hills to our fathers' house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd come upon a great charred circle, where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient earth was singed an acre round;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one stone stair, symbolic of my life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascending, winding, leading up to nought!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis worth a poet's seeing. Will you go?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made no answer. Had I any right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To weep with this man, that I dared to speak?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman stood between his soul and mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waved us off from touching evermore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those unclean white hands of hers. Enough.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had burnt our viols, and were silent.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence lengthened till it pressed. I spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To breathe: "I think you were ill afterward."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More ill," he answered, "had been scarcely ill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hoped this feeble fumbling at life's knot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might end concisely, but I failed to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As formerly I failed to live, and thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew willing, having tried all other ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To try just God's. Humility's so good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When pride's impossible. Mark us, how we make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our virtues, cousin, from our worn-out sins,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which smack of them from henceforth. Is it right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, to wed here while you love there?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet because a man sins once, the sin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleaves to him, in necessity to sin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That if he sin not so to damn himself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sins so, to damn others with himself:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, to wed here, loving there, becomes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A duty. Virtue buds a dubious leaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round mortal brows; your ivy's better, dear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet she, 'tis certain, is my very wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very lamb left mangled by the wolves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through my own bad shepherding: and could I choose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But take her on my shoulder past this stretch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rough, uneasy wilderness, poor lamb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor child, poor child? Aurora, my beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not vex you any more to-night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, having spoken what I came to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest shall please you. What she can, in me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection, tender liking, freedom, ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shall have surely, liberally, for her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hers, Aurora. Small amends they'll make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hideous evils which she had not known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except by me, and for this imminent loss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This forfeit presence of a gracious friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which also she must forfeit for my sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since, . . . drop your hand in mine a moment, sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're parting! Ah, my snowdrop, what a touch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the wind had swept it off! You grudge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your gelid sweetness on my palm but so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment? Angry, that I could not bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You . . . speaking, breathing, living, side by side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some one called my wife . . . and live, myself?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, be not cruel you must understand!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your lightest footfall on a floor of mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would shake the house, my lintel being uncrossed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Gainst angels: henceforth it is night with me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, henceforth, I put the shutters up:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auroras must not come to spoil my dark."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled so feebly, with an empty hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched sideway from me as indeed he looked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any one but me to give him help;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, while the moon came suddenly out full,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double-rose of our Italian moons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficient plainly for the heaven and earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The stars struck dumb and washed away in dews
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of golden glory, and the mountains steeped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In divine languor), he, the man, appeared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So pale and patient, like the marble man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sculptor puts his personal sadness in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To join his grandeur of ideal thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if his mallet struck me from my height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of passionate indignation, I who had risen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale, doubting paused . . . Was Romney mad indeed?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had all this wrong of heart made sick the brain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then quiet, with a sort of tremulous pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, cousin," I said coldly; "a farewell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was sooner spoken 'twixt a pair of friends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those old days, than seems to suit you now.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howbeit, since then, I've writ a book or two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm somewhat dull still in the manly art
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of phrase and metaphrase. Why, any man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can carve a score of white Loves out of snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Buonarroti in my Florence there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set them on the wall in some safe shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As safe, sir, as your marriage! very good;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though if a woman took one from the ledge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it on the table by her flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let it mind her of a certain friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould drop at once (so better), would not bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her nail-mark even, where she took it up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little tenderly, so best, I say:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I would not touch the fragile thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And risk to spoil it half an hour before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shall shine to melt it: leave it there.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm plain at speech, direct in purpose: when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak, you'll take the meaning as it is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not allow for puckerings in the silk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clever stitches. I'm a woman, sir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use the woman's figures naturally,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you the male license. So, I wish you well.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm simply sorry for the griefs you've had,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not for your sake only, but mankind's.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This race is never grateful: from the first,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fills their cup at supper with pure wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which back they give at cross-time on a sponge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vinegar and gall."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If gratefuller,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He murmured, "by so much less pitiable!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's self would never have come down to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could man have thanked Him for it."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis patent that, whatever," I resumed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You suffered from this thanklessness of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sink no more than Moses' bulrush-boat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When once relieved of Moses, for you're light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're light, my cousin! which is well for you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And manly. For myself, now mark me, sir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They burnt Leigh Hall; but if, consummated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To devils, heightened beyond Lucifers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had burnt, instead, a star or two of those
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw above there just a moment back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the moon abolished them, destroyed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And riddled them in ashes through a sieve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the head of the foundering universe what then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you and I remained still you and I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could not shift our places as mere friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor render decent you should toss a phrase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the point of actual feeling! Nay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not interrupt me: as you said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're parting. Certainly, not once nor twice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-night you've mocked me somewhat, or yourself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, at least, have not deserved it so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should meet it unsurprised. But now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough: we're parting . . . parting. Cousin Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you well through all the acts of life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life's relations, wedlock not the least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it shall 'please me,' in your words, to know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You yield your wife, protection, freedom, ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very tender liking. May you live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So happy with her, Romney, that your friends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall praise her for it! Meantime some of us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are wholly dull in keeping ignorant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what she has suffered by you, and what debt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sorrow your rich love sits down to pay:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if 'tis sweet for love to pay its debt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis sweeter still for love to give its gift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you, be liberal in the sweeter way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can, I think. At least, as touches me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You owe her, cousin Romney, no amends:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not used to hold my gown so fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need entreat her now to let it go;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady never was a friend of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor capable, I thought you knew as much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of losing for your sake so poor a prize
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such a worthless friendship. Be content,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good cousin, therefore, both for her and you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll never spoil your dark, nor dull your noon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor vex you when you're merry, or at rest:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not need to put a shutter up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep out this Aurora, though your north
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can make Auroras which vex nobody,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce known from night, I fancied! let me add,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My larks fly higher than some windows. Well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've read your Leighs. Indeed, 'twould shake a house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such as I came in with outstretched hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still warm and thrilling from the clasp of one . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one we know, . . . to acknowledge, palm to palm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mistress there, the Lady Waldemar."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now God be with us" . . . with a sudden clash
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of voice he interrupted. "What name's that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You spoke a name, Aurora."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pardon me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would that, Romney, I could name your wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor wound you, yet be worthy."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are we mad?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He echoed. "Wife! mine! Lady Waldemar!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you said my wife." He sprang to his feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threw his noble head back toward the moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who swims against a stormy sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then laughed with such a helpless, hopeless scorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood and trembled.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May God judge me so,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said at last, "I came convicted here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And humbled sorely if not enough. I came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this woman from her crystal soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had shown me something which a man calls light:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because too, formerly, I sinned by her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As then and ever since I have, by God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through arrogance of nature, though I loved . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom best, I need not say, since that is writ
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too plainly in the book of my misdeeds:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus I came here to abase myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fasten, kneeling, on her regent brows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A garland which I startled thence one day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her beautiful June-youth. But here again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm baffled, fail in my abasement as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My aggrandisement: there's no room left for me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any woman's foot who misconceives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My nature, purpose, possible actions. What!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the Aurora who made large my dreams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To frame your greatness? you conceive so small?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You stand so less than woman through being more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lose your natural instinct (like a beast)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through intellectual culture? since indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that any common she
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would dare adopt such monstrous forgeries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the legible life signature of such
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I, with all my blots with all my blots!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, then, peerless cousin, we are peers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last we're even. Ay, you've left your height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here upon my level we take hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here I reach you to forgive you, sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's a fall, Aurora. Long ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seldom understood me, but before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not blame you. Then, you only seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So high above, you could not see below;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now I breathe, but now I pardon! nay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're parting. Dearest, men have burnt my house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maligned my motives; but not one, I swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has wronged my soul as this Aurora has
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who called the Lady Waldemar my wife."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not married to her! yet you said" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Again?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, read the lines" (he held a letter out)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She sent you through me."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the moonlight there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tore the meaning out with passionate haste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much rather than I read it. Thus it ran.

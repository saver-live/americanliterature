<p> THIS is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse! </p><p> THIS is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten. </p><p> THIS is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head. </p><p> SHE thinks it is a very hard cupboard! </p><p> THE Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard. </p><p> <img alt="The Story of Miss Moppet cover" title="The Story of Miss Moppet cover" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/the-story-of-miss-moppet.jpg" style="max-width:400px; float:left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="16609139" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> MISS MOPPET ties up her head in a duster, and sits before the fire. </p><p> THE Mouse thinks she is looking very ill. He comes sliding down the bell- pull. </p><p> MISS MOPPET looks worse and worse. The Mouse comes a little nearer. </p><p> MISS MOPPET holds her poor head in her paws, and looks at him through a hole in the duster. The Mouse comes VERY close. </p><p> AND then all of a sudden —Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse! </p><p> AND because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet —Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet. </p><p> SHE ties him up in the duster, and tosses it about like a ball. </p><p> BUT she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it—there was no Mouse! </p><p> HE has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard! </p><p> <b>THE END</b> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

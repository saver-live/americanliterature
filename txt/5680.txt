<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peradventure of old, some bard in Ionian Islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking alone by the sea, hearing the wash of the waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned the secret from them of the beautiful verse elegiac,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing into his song motion and sound of the sea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as the wave of the sea, upheaving in long undulations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunges loud on the sands, pauses, and turns, and retreats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Hexameter, rising and singing, with cadence sonorous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falls; and in refluent rhythm back the Pentameter flows?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in his youth alone, but in age, may the heart of the poet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloom into song, as the gorse blossoms in autumn and spring.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in tenderness wanting, yet rough are the rhymes of our poet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it be Jacob's voice, Esau's, alas! are the hands.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be grateful to writers for what is left in the inkstand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When to leave off is an art only attained by the few.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the Three be One? you ask me; I answer by asking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail and snow and rain, are they not three, and yet one?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the mirage uplifted the land floats vague in the ether,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ships and the shadows of ships hang in the motionless air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by the art of the poet our common life is uplifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, transfigured, the world floats in a luminous haze.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a French poem is Life; being only perfect in structure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When with the masculine rhymes mingled the feminine are.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from the mountain descends the brooklet, rejoicing in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freedom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little it dreams of the mill hid in the valley below;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad with the joy of existence, the child goes singing and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little dreaming what toils lie in the future concealed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ink from our pen, so flow our thoughts and our feelings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we begin to write, however sluggish before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Kingdom of Heaven, the Fountain of Youth is within us;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we seek it elsewhere, old shall we grow in the search.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisely the Hebrews admit no Present tense in their language;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are speaking the word, it is is already the Past.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twilight of age all things seem strange and phantasmal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As between daylight and dark ghost-like the landscape appears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great is the art of beginning, but greater the art is of ending;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a poem is marred by a superfluous verse.

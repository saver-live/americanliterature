<p>Your grasses up north are as blue as jade, <br> Our mulberries here curve green-threaded branches; <br> And at last you think of returning home, <br> Now when my heart is almost broken.... <br> O breeze of the spring, since I dare not know you, <br> Why part the silk curtains by my bed? <br></p>

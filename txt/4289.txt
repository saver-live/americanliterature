<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I a man's fair form, then might my sighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine ear, and find thy gentle heart; so well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would passion arm me for the enterprize:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ah! I am no knight whose foeman dies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cuirass glistens on my bosom's swell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am no happy shepherd of the dell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose lips have trembled with a maiden's eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet must I doat upon thee, call thee sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter by far than Hybla's honied roses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When steep'd in dew rich to intoxication.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! I will taste that dew, for me 'tis meet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the moon her pallid face discloses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll gather some by spells, and incantation.

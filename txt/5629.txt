               (Triolet)

               Just over the way where the rainbow fell,
               I knew I would find a treasure of gold,
               So I clambered over the fence pell mell,
               Just over the way where the rainbow fell;
               But I promised her I never would tell,
               And I know if I tell you'll tell her I told.
               Just over the way where the rainbow fell,
               I certainly found a treasure of gold.

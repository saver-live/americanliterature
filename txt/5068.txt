<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight came home from the quest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muddied and sore he came.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battered of shield and crest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bannerless, bruised and lame.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting we take no shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better is man for a fall.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrily borne, the bugle-horn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered the warders call:,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my lance to mend (Haro!),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my horse to be shot!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, they were strong, and the fight was long;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I paid as good as I got!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, dark and deep their van,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mocked my battle-cry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not miss my man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I could not carry by:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utterly whelmed was I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flung under, horse and all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrily borne, the bugle-horn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered the warders call!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wounds are noised abroad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But theirs my foemen cloaked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye see my broken sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never the blades she broke;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying them stroke for stroke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good handsel over all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrily borne, the bugle-horn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered the warders call!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My shame ye count and know.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye say the quest is vain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye have not seen my foe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye have not told his slain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely he fights again, again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when ye prove his line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall come to your aid my broken blade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last, lost fight of mine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is my lance to mend (Haro!),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is my horse to be shot!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, they were strong, and the fight was long;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I paid as good as I got!

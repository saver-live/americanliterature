<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the season, when through all the land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merle and mavis build, and building sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those lovely lyrics, written by His hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom Saxon Caedmon calls the Blitheheart King;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the boughs the purple buds expand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banners of the vanguard of the Spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rivulets, rejoicing, rush and leap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wave their fluttering signals from the steep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robin and the bluebird, piping loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled all the blossoming orchards with their glee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparrows chirped as if they still were proud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their race in Holy Writ should mentioned be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hungry crows assembled in a crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clamored their piteous prayer incessantly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing who hears the ravens cry, and said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give us, O Lord, this day our daily bread!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Sound the birds of passage sailed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking some unknown language strange and sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tropic isle remote, and passing hailed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village with the cheers of all their fleet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or quarrelling together, laughed and railed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like foreign sailors, landed in the street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of seaport town, and with outlandish noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of oaths and gibberish frightening girls and boys.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus came the jocund Spring in Killingworth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fabulous day; some hundred years ago;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrifty farmers, as they tilled the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard with alarm the cawing of the crow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mingled with the universal mirth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassandra-like, prognosticating woe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shook their heads, and doomed with dreadful words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To swift destruction the whole race of birds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a town-meeting was convened straightway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set a price upon the guilty heads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these marauders, who, in lieu of pay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levied black-mail upon the garden beds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cornfields, and beheld without dismay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awful scarecrow, with his fluttering shreds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skeleton that waited at their feast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereby their sinful pleasure was increased.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from his house, a temple painted white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fluted columns, and a roof of red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Squire came forth, august and splendid sight!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly descending, with majestic tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three flights of steps, nor looking left nor right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the long street he walked, as one who said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A town that boasts inhabitants like me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can have no lack of good society!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parson, too, appeared, a man austere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instinct of whose nature was to kill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of God he preached from year to year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And read, with fervor, Edwards on the Will;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His favorite pastime was to slay the deer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Summer on some Adirondac hill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en now, while walking down the rural lane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lopped the wayside lilies with his cane.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Academy, whose belfry crowned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill of Science with its vane of brass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Preceptor, gazing idly round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at the clouds, and now at the green grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all absorbed in reveries profound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fair Almira in the upper class,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was, as in a sonnet he had said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pure as water, and as good as bread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next the Deacon issued from his door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his voluminous neck-cloth, white as snow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suit of sable bombazine he wore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His form was ponderous, and his step was slow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There never was so wise a man before;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed the incarnate "Well, I told you so!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to perpetuate his great renown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a street named after him in town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These came together in the new town-hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sundry farmers from the region round.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Squirt presided, dignified and tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His air impressive and his reasoning sound;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill fared it with the birds, both great and small;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly a friend in all that crowd they found,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But enemies enough, who every one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charged them with all the crimes beneath the sun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they had ended, from his place apart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the Preceptor, to redress the wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, trembling like a steed before the start,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked round bewildered on the expectant throng;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thought of fair Almira, and took heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak out what was in him, clear and strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike regardless of their smile or frown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quite determined not to be laughed down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plato, anticipating the Reviewers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his Republic banished without pity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poets; in this little town of yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You put to death, by means of a Committee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ballad-singers and the Troubadours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street-musicians of the heavenly city,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds, who make sweet music for us all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our dark hours, as David did for Saul.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thrush that carols at the dawn of day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the green steeples of the piny wood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oriole in the elm; the noisy jay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jargoning like a foreigner at his food;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bluebird balanced on some topmost spray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding with melody the neighborhood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linnet and meadow-lark, and all the throng
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dwell in nests, and have the gift of song.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You slay them all! and wherefore! for the gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a scant handful more or less of wheat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rye, or barley, or some other grain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scratched up at random by industrious feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searching for worm or weevil after rain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a few cherries, that are not so sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As are the songs these uninvited guests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing at their feast with comfortable breasts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you ne'er think what wondrous beings these?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you ne'er think who made them and who taught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dialect they speak, where melodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone are the interpreters of thought?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose household words are songs in many keys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter than instrument of man e'er caught!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose habitations in the tree-tops even
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are half-way houses on the road to heaven!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think, every morning when the sun peeps through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim, leaf-latticed windows of the grove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How jubilant the happy birds renew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their old, melodious madrigals of love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you think of this, remember too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is always morning somewhere, and above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awakening continent; from shore to shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere the birds are singing evermore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think of your woods and orchards without birds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in an idiot's brain remembered words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang empty 'mid the cobwebs of his dreams!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will bleat of flocks or bellowing of herds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make up for the lost music, when your teams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag home the stingy harvest, and no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathered gleaners follow to your door?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What! would you rather see the incessant stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of insects in the windrows of the hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the locust and the grasshopper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their melancholy hurdy-gurdies play?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this more pleasant to you than the whir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of meadow-lark, and her sweet roundelay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or twitter of little field-fares, as you take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your nooning in the shade of bush and brake?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You call them thieves and pillagers; but know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the winged wardens of your farms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from the cornfields drive the insidious foe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from your harvests keep a hundred harms;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the blackest of them all, the crow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renders good service as your man-at-arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crushing the beetle in his coat of mail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crying havoc on the slug and snail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I teach your children gentleness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mercy to the weak, and reverence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Life, which, in its weakness or excess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is still a gleam of God's omnipotence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Death, which, seeming darkness, is no less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selfsame light, although averted hence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When by your laws, your actions, and your speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You contradict the very things I teach?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this he closed; and through the audience went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A murmur, like the rustle of dead leaves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers laughed and nodded, and some bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their yellow heads together like their sheaves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men have no faith in fine-spun sentiment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who put their trust in bullocks and in beeves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds were doomed; and, as the record shows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bounty offered for the heads of crows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another audience out of reach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had no voice nor vote in making laws,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the papers read his little speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crowned his modest temples with applause;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made him conscious, each one more than each,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still was victor, vanquished in their cause.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetest of all the applause he won from thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O fair Almira at the Academy!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the dreadful massacre began;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er fields and orchards, and o'er woodland crests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceaseless fusillade of terror ran.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead fell the birds, with blood-stains on their breasts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wounded crept away from sight of man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the young died of famine in their nests;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slaughter to be told in groans, not words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very St. Bartholomew of Birds!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summer came, and all the birds were dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days were like hot coals; the very ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was burned to ashes; in the orchards fed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myriads of caterpillars, and around
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultivated fields and garden beds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hosts of devouring insects crawled, and found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No foe to check their march, till they had made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land a desert without leaf or shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devoured by worms, like Herod, was the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, like Herod, it had ruthlessly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaughtered the Innocents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the trees spun down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The canker-worms upon the passers-by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon each woman's bonnet, shawl, and gown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shook them off with just a little cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were the terror of each favorite walk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless theme of all the village talk.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers grew impatient but a few
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confessed their error, and would not complain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For after all, the best thing one can do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is raining, is to let it rain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they repealed the law, although they knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not call the dead to life again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As school-boys, finding their mistake too late,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw a wet sponge across the accusing slate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That year in Killingworth the Autumn came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the light of his majestic look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonder of the falling tongues of flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illumined pages of his Doom's-Day book.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few lost leaves blushed crimson with their shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drowned themselves despairing in the brook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the wild wind went moaning everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamenting the dead children of the air!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next Spring a stranger sight was seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sight that never yet by bard was sung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As great a wonder as it would have been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If some dumb animal had found a tongue!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wagon, overarched with evergreen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon whose boughs were wicker cages hung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All full of singing birds, came down the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the air with music wild and sweet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the country round these birds were brought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By order of the town, with anxious quest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, loosened from their wicker prisons, sought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In woods and fields the places they loved best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing loud canticles, which many thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were satires to the authorities addressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While others, listening in green lanes, averred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such lovely music never had been heard!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But blither still and louder carolled they
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the morrow, for they seemed to know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the fair Almira's wedding-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everywhere, around, above, below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Preceptor bore his bride away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their songs burst forth in joyous overflow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a new heaven bent over a new earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the sunny farms of Killingworth.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FINALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour was late; the fire burned low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord's eyes were closed in sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And near the story's end a deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonorous sound at times was heard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the distant bagpipes blow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this all laughed; the Landlord stirred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one awaking from a swound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, gazing anxiously around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protested that he had not slept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only shut his eyes, and kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ears attentive to each word.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all arose, and said "Good Night."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone remained the drowsy Squire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rake the embers of the fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quench the waning parlor light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from the windows, here and there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattered lamps a moment gleamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the illumined hostel seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constellation of the Bear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward, athwart the misty air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking and setting toward the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off the village clock struck one.

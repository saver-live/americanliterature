<p>WHEN you and I, like all things kind or cruel,<br> The garnered days and light evasive hours,<br> Are gone again to be a part of flowers<br> And tears and tides, in life's divine renewal,<br> <br> If some grey eve to certain eyes should wear<br> A deeper radiance than mere light can give,<br> Some silent page abruptly flush and live,<br> May it not be that you and I are there?</p>

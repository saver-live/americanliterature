<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the hill and over the dale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the bourn to Dawlish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where gingerbread wives have a scanty sale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gingerbread nuts are smallish.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rantipole Betty she ran down a hill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kicked up her petticoats fairly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says I I'll be Jack if you will be Gill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she sat on the grass debonairly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's somebody coming, here's somebody coming!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says I 'tis the wind at a parley;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So without any fuss any hawing and humming
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lay on the grass debonairly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's somebody here and here's somebody there!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says I hold your tongue you young Gipsey;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she held her tongue and lay plump and fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dead as a Venus tipsy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O who wouldn't hie to Dawlish fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O who wouldn't stop in a Meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O who would not rumple the daisies there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make the wild fern for a bed do!

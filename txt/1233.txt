<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wordsworth upon Helvellyn! Let the cloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ebb audibly along the mountain-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then break against the rock, and show behind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowland valleys floating up to crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense with beauty. He with forehead bowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And humble-lidded eyes, as one inclined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the sovran thought of his own mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very meek with inspirations proud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes here his rightful place as poet-priest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the high altar, singing prayer and prayer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the higher Heavens. A noble vision free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Haydon's hand has flung out from the mist:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No portrait this, with Academic air!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the poet and his poetry.

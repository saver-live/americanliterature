<h2>Introduction</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>It being the commonest mode of procedure, I premise a few candid remarks</p><p>To the Reader;</p><p>This trifle, begun to please only myself and my own private fancy, was laid on the shelf. But some friends, who had seen it, induced me, by dint of saying they liked it, to put it in print. That is, having come to that very conclusion, I consulted them when it could make no confusion. For, (though in the gentlest of ways,) they had hinted it was scarce worth the while, I should doubtless have printed it.</p><p>I began it, intending a Fable, a frail, slender thing, rhyme-ywinged, with a sting in its tail. But, by addings and alterings not previously planned,—digressions chance-hatched, like birds' eggs in the sand,—and dawdlings to suit every whimsy's demand, (always freeing the bird which I held in my hand, for the two perched, perhaps out of reach, in the tree,)—it grew by degrees to the size which you see. I was like the old woman that carried the calf, and my neighbors, like hers, no doubt, wonder and laugh, and when, my strained arms with their grown burthen full, I call it my Fable, they call it a bull.</p><p>Having scrawled at full gallop (as far as that goes) in a style that is neither good verse nor bad prose, and being a person whom nobody knows, some people will say I am rather more free with my readers than it is becoming to be, that I seem to expect them to wait on my leisure in following wherever I wander at pleasure, that, in short, I take more than a young author's lawful ease, and laugh in a queer way so like Mephistopheles, that the public will doubt, as they grope through my rhythm, if in truth I am making fun at them or with them.</p><p>So the excellent Public is hereby assured that the sale of my book is already secured. For there is not a poet throughout the whole land, but will purchase a copy or two out of hand, in the fond expectation of being amused in it, by seeing his betters cut-up and abused in it. Now, I find, by a pretty exact calculation, there are something like ten thousand bards in the nation, of that special variety whom the Review and Magazine critics call lofty and true, and about thirty thousand (this tribe is increasing) of the kinds who are termed full of promise and pleasing. The Public will see by a glance at this schedule, that they cannot expect me to be over-sedulous about courting them, since it seems I have got enough fuel made sure of for boiling my pot.</p><p>As for such of our poets as find not their names mentioned once in my pages, with praises or blames, let them send in their cards, without further delay, to my friend G. P. Putnam, Esquire, in Broadway, where a list will be kept with [Pg 306] the strictest regard to the day and the hour of receiving the card. Then, taking them up as I chance to have time, (that is, if their names can be twisted in rhyme,) I will honestly give each his proper position, at the rate of one author to each new edition. Thus a PREMIUM is offered sufficiently high (as the magazines say when they tell their best lie) to induce bards to club their resources and buy the balance of every edition, until they have all of them fairly been run through the mill.</p><p>One word to such readers (judicious and wise) as read books with something behind the mere eyes, of whom in the country, perhaps, there are two, including myself, gentle reader, and you. All the characters sketched in this slight jeu d'esprit, though, it may be, they seem, here and there, rather free, and drawn from a Mephistophelian stand-point, are meant to be faithful, and that is the grand point, and none but an owl would feel sore at a rub from a jester who tells you, without any subterfuge, that he sits in Diogenes' tub.</p><h2>A Fable for Critics</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Through his babyhood no kind of pleasure he took</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>I'd apologize here for my many digressions</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Yonder, calm as a cloud, Alcott stalks in a dream</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>There is Whittier, whose swelling and vehement heart</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Miranda meanwhile has succeed in driving</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>But my good mother Baystate wants no praise of mine</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Footnotes</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>[C] To demonstrate quickly and easily how per- -versely absurd 'tis to sound this name Cowper,</p><p>As people in general call him named super,</p><p>I just add that he rhymes it himself with horse-trooper.</p><p>[D] (If you call Snooks an owl, he will show by his looks That he's morally certain you're jealous of Snooks.)</p><p>[E] (Cuts rightly called wooden, as all must admit.)</p><p>[F] That is in most cases we do, but not all, Past a doubt, there are men who are innately small,</p><p>Such as Blank, who, without being 'minished a tittle,</p><p>Might stand for a type of the Absolute Little.</p><p>[G] (And at this just conclusion will surely arrive, That the goodness of earth is more dead than alive.)</p><p>[H] Not forgetting their tea and their toast, though, the while.</p><p>[I] Turn back now to page—goodness only knows what, And take a fresh hold on the thread of my plot.</p>

<p> This song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like the fond arms of love.<br> This song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of blessing.<br> When you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in your ear, when you are in the crowd it will fence you about with aloofness.<br> My song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will transport your heart to the verge of the unknown.<br> It will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is over your road.<br> My song will sit in the pupils of your eyes, and will carry your sight into the heart of things.<br> And when my voice is silent in death, my song will speak in your living heart.</p>

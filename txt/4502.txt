<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mithras, God of the Morning, our trumpets waken the Wall!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome is above the Nations, but Thou art over all!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as the names are answered, and the guards are marched away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mithras, also a soldier, give us strength for the day!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mithras, God of the Noontide, the heather swims in the heat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our helmets scorch our foreheads, our sandals burn our feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the ungirt hour, now ere we blink and drowse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mithras, also a soldier, keep us true to our vows!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mithras, God of the Sunset, low on the Western main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou descending immortal, immortal to rise again!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the watch is ended, now when the wine is drawn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mithras, also a soldier, keep us pure till the dawn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mithras, God of the Midnight, here where the great bull dies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look on thy children in darkness. Oh take our sacrifice!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many roads thou hast fashioned, all of them lead to the Light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mithras, also a soldier, teach us to die aright!

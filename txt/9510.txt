<pre>I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance there upon the shore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What need have you to care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wind or waters roar?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tumble out your hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the salt drops have wet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being young you have not known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fools triumph, nor yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love lost as soon as won,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the best labourer dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the sheaves to bind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What need have you to dread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monstrous crying of wind?

II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has no one said those daring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind eyes should be more learnd?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or warned you how despairing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moths are when they are burned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could have warned you, but you are young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we speak a different tongue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O you will take what evers offered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream that all the worlds a friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffer as your mother suffered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be as broken in the end.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am old and you are young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I speak a barbarous tongue.

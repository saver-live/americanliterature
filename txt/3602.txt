&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summertime on Bredon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells they sound so clear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round both the shires they ring them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In steeples far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A happy noise to hear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here of a Sunday morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love and I would lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see the coloured counties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the larks so high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About us in the sky.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells would ring to call her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In valleys miles away:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come all to church, good people;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good people, come and pray."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here my love would stay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would turn and answer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the springing thyme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, peal upon our wedding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we will hear the chime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And come to church in time."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the snows at Christmas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Bredon top were strown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love rose up so early
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stole out unbeknown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went to church alone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tolled the one bell only,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groom there was none to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mourners followed after,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so to church went she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would not wait for me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells they sound on Bredon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still the steeples hum.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come all to church, good people,"-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, noisy bells, be dumb;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear you, I will come.

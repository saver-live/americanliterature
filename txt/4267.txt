&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thy western halls of gold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou sittest in thy state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bards, that erst sublimely told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic deeds, and sang of fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fervour seize their adamantine lyres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose chords are solid rays, and twinkle radiant fires.

2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Homer with his nervous arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strikes the twanging harp of war,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the western splendour warms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the trumpets sound afar:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, what creates the most intense surprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soul looks out through renovated eyes.

3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, through thy Temple wide, melodious swells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet majestic tone of Maro's lyre:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul delighted on each accent dwells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enraptur'd dwells, not daring to respire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while he tells of grief around a funeral pyre.

4.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis awful silence then again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expectant stand the spheres;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathless the laurell'd peers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor move, till ends the lofty strain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor move till Milton's tuneful thunders cease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave once more the ravish'd heavens in peace.

5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou biddest Shakespeare wave his hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quickly forward spring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Passions a terrific band
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each vibrates the string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with its tyrant temper best accords,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from their Master's lips pour forth the inspiring words.

6.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver trumpet Spenser blows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as its martial notes to silence flee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a virgin chorus flows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hymn in praise of spotless Chastity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis still! Wild warblings from the Aeolian lyre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enchantment softly breathe, and tremblingly expire.

7.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next thy Tasso's ardent numbers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Float along the pleased air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling youth from idle slumbers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rousing them from Pleasure's lair:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then o'er the strings his fingers gently move,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And melt the soul to pity and to love.

8.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Thou joinest with the Nine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the powers of song combine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We listen here on earth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy dying tones that fill the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And charm the ear of evening fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thee, great God of Bards, receive their heavenly birth.

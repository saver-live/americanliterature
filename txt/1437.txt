<p><cite class="al-title">Blazing World</cite>, or its full title, <cite class="al-title">The Description for a New World, called The Blazing-World</cite> (1666) was a groundbreaking work in the genre of science fiction, written by Margaret Cavendish, who was likely the first woman to publish using her own name. The book is a fantastical display of her intellect, imagination, and curiosity about natural science, at a time early in the Enlightenment when such speculation about the universe, time, and space were still considered somewhat heretical. The novel features animal-human hybrids and a womanâ€™s absolute rule as Empress over a parallel planet.

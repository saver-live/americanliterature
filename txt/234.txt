<p>And to you, my first vagary,<br> Isaid goodbye. The east was turning blue,<br> Though I didn't know what you meant,<br> You said, simply: 'I'll not forget.'<br> <br> Other faces appear and vanish,<br> Dear today, and tomorrow, done.<br> Why is at this page alone,<br> The corner is turned down?<br> <br> Forever the book opens<br> To the very same place, strange:<br> It's as if the years have not passed,<br> From the moment of farewell.<br> <br> Oh, who said that the heart is stone?<br> I know: it is made of fireâ€¦<br> I'll never understand: were you close<br> To me, or simply loved me?<br></p>

<p>A jade cup was broken because old age came<br> too soon to give fulfilment to hopes; after drinking<br> three cups of wine I wiped my sword and<br> started to dance under an autumn moon first<br> singing in a high voice then unable to halt<br> tears coming; I remember the day when first<br> I was summoned to court and I was feasted splendidly<br> writing poems in praise of the Emperor, making<br> jokes with officials around several times changing<br> my horse, taking the best from the<br> imperial stables; with my whip studded with<br> jade and coral presented to me by the Emperor,<br> my life was free and easy, people calling me<br> the "Banished Immortal." Hsi Shih was good<br> at smiling as well as frowning, useless<br> for ordinary girls to try and imitate her.<br> Surely it was only her loveliness the king adored,<br> but unfortunately jealousy within the palace<br> led to her death. <br></p>

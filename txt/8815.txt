<p> WHAT strange presentiment, O Mother, lies<br> On thy waste brow and sadly-folded lips,<br> Forefeeling the Light's terrible eclipse<br> On Calvary, as if love made thee wise,<br> And thou couldst read in those dear infant eyes<br> The sorrow that beneath their smiling sleeps,<br> And guess what bitter tears a mother weeps<br> When the cross darkens her unclouded skies?<br> <br> Sad Lady, if some mother, passing thee,<br> Should feel a throb of thy foreboding pain,<br> And think -- "My child at home clings so to me,<br> With the same smile . . . and yet in vain, in vain,<br> Since even this Jesus died on Calvary" --<br> Say to her then: "He also rose again."<br> </p>

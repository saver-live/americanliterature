&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islanded in Severn stream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridges from the steepled crest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross the water east and west.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag of morn in conqueror's state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enters at the English gate:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vanquished eve, as night prevails,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bleeds upon the road to Wales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ages since the vanquished bled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round my mother's marriage-bed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the ravens feasted far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the open house of war:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Severn down to Buildwas ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coloured with the death of man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couched upon her brother's grave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Saxon got me on the slave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of fight is silent long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That began the ancient wrong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long the voice of tears is still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wept of old the endless ill.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart it has not died,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war that sleeps on Severn side;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cease not fighting, east and west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the marches of my breast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the truceless armies yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trample, rolled in blood and sweat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kill and kill and never die;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think that each is I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None will part us, none undo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knot that makes one flesh of two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick with hatred, sick with pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangling-When shall we be slain?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shall I be dead and rid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wrong my father did?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long, how long, till spade and hearse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put to sleep my mother's curse?

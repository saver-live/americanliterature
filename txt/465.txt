On the last night of October,
Comes the mystic Halloween.
The night when ghosts and witches,
By mortals can be seen.
Then merry maidens fortunes tell,
And tricks on others pay;
Aud children bob for apples
On Halloween so gay.

<i>SING</i> (to the tune "Sweet By and By")

Jack-o-lanterns are glimmering round,
All sorts of strange sights may be seen.
There are goblins and witches abroad,
For this is the mystic Halloween.
Holloween, Halloween,
Is the night when the future may be seen,
Halloween, Halloween,
Is the night when the future may be seen.

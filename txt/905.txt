I 'll scamper with might and with main! <br><br><br><br><br> </p><p> Pussy-cat Mew set off on her way,<br> Stepping quite softly and feeling quite gay.<br> Smooth was the road, so she traveled at ease,<br> Warmed by the sunshine and fanned by the breeze. </p><p> Over the hills to the valleys below,<br> Through the deep woods where the soft mosses grow,<br> Skirting the fields, with buttercups dotted,<br> Swiftly our venturesome Pussy-cat trotted. </p><p> Sharp watch she kept when a village she neared,<br> For boys and their mischief our Pussy-cat feared!<br> Often she crept through the grasses so deep<br> To pass by a dog that was lying asleep. </p><p> Once, as she walked through a sweet-clover field,<br> Something beside her affrightedly squealed,<br> And swift from her path there darted away<br> A tiny field-mouse, with a coat of soft gray. </p><p> "Nowhere," thought our Pussy, "is chance for a dinner;<br> The one that runs fastest must surely be winner!"<br> So quickly she started the mouse to give chase,<br> And over the clover they ran a great race. </p><p> But just when it seemed that Pussy would win,<br> The mouse spied a hole and quickly popped in;<br> And so he escaped, for the hole was so small<br> That Pussy-cat could n't squeeze in it at all. </p><p> So, softly she crouched, and with eyes big and round<br> Quite steadily watched that small hole in the ground<br> "This mouse really thinks he 's escaped me," she said,<br> "But I 'll catch him sure if he sticks out his head!" </p><p> But while she was watching the poor mouse's plight,<br> A deep growl behind made her jump with affright;<br> She gave a great cry, and then started to run<br> As swift as a bullet that 's shot from a gun! </p><p> "Meow! Oh, meow "our poor Puss did say;<br> "Bow-wow!" cried the dog, who was not far away.<br> O'er meadows and ditches they scampered apace,<br> O'er fences and hedges they kept up the race! </p><p> Then Pussy-cat Mew saw before her a tree,<br> And knew that a safe place of refuge 't would be;<br> So far up the tree with a bound she did go,<br> And left the big dog to growl down below. </p><p> But now, by good fortune, a man came that way,<br> And called to the dog, who was forced to obey;<br> But Puss did not come down the tree till she knew<br> That the man and the dog were far out of view. </p><p> Pursuing her way, at nightfall she came<br> To London, a town you know well by name;<br> And wandering 'round in byway and street,<br> A strange Pussy-cat she happened to meet. </p><p> "Good evening," said Pussy-cat Mew. "Can you tell<br> In which of these houses the Queen may now dwell?<br> I 'm a stranger in town, and I 'm anxious to see<br> What sort of a person a real Queen may be." </p><p> "My friend," said the other, "you really must know<br> It is n't permitted that strangers should go<br> Inside of the palace, unless they 're invited,<br> And stray Pussy-cats are apt to be slighted. </p><p> "By good luck, however, I 'm quite well aware<br> Of a way to the palace by means of a stair<br> That never is guarded; so just come with me,<br> And a glimpse of the Queen you shall certainly see." </p><p> Puss thanked her new friend, and together they stole<br> To the back of the palace, and crept through a hole<br> In the fence, and quietly came to the stair<br> Which the stranger Pussy-cat promised was there. </p><p> "Now here I must leave you," the strange Pussy said,<br> "So do n't be 'fraid-cat, but go straight ahead,<br> And do n't be alarmed if by chance you are seen,<br> For people will think you belong to the Queen." </p><p> So Pussy-cat Mew did as she had been told,<br> And walked through the palace with manner so bold<br> She soon reached the room where the Queen sat in state,<br> Surrounded by lords and by ladies so great. </p><p> And there in the corner our Pussy sat down,<br> And gazed at the scepter and blinked at the crown,<br> And eyed the Queen's dress, all purple and gold;<br> Which was surely a beautiful sight to behold. </p><p> But all of a sudden she started, for there<br> Was a little gray mouse, right under the chair<br> Where her Majesty sat, and Pussy well knew<br> She 'd scream with alarm if the mouse met her view. </p><p> So up toward the chair our Pussy-cat stole,<br> But the mouse saw her coming and ran for its hole;<br> But Pussy ran after, and during the race<br> A wonderful, terrible panic took place! </p><p> The ladies all jumped on their chairs in alarm,<br> The lords drew their swords to protect them from harm,<br> And the Queen gave a scream and fainted away--<br> A very undignified act, I must say. </p><p> And some one cried "Burglars!" and some one cried "Treason!"<br> And some one cried "Murder!" but none knew the reason;<br> And some one cried "Fire! they are burning the house!"<br> And some one cried "Silence! it 's only a mouse!" </p><p> But Pussy-cat Mew was so awfully scared<br> By the shouting and screaming, no longer she dared<br> To stay in the room; so without more delay<br> She rushed from the palace and scampered away! </p><p> So bristling her fur, and with heart beating fast,<br> She came to the road leading homeward at last.<br> "What business," she thought, "has a poor country cat<br> To visit a city of madmen like that? </p><p> "Straight homeward I 'll go, where I am well fed,<br> Where mistress is kind, and soft is my bed;<br> Let other cats travel, if they wish to roam,<br> But as for myself, I shall now stay at home." </p><p> And now over hills and valleys she ran,<br> And journeyed as fast as a Pussy-cat can;<br> Till just as the dawn of the day did begin<br> She, safely at home, stole quietly in. </p><p> And there was the fire, with the pot boiling on it,<br> And there was the maid, in the blue checkered bonnet<br> And there was the corner where Pussy oft basked,<br> And there was the mistress, who eagerly asked: </p><p> "Pussy-cat, Pussy-cat, where have you been?"<br> "I 've been to London, to visit the Queen."<br> "Pussy-cat, Pussy-cat, what did you there?"<br> "I frightened a little mouse under her chair!" </p><p></p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

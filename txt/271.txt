<p>The high vault is bluer<br> Than the sky's solid blue…<br> Forgive me, happy boy,<br> The death I brought you –<br> <br> For the roses from every place,<br> For your foolish words,<br> That your bold dark face<br> Pale with love, stirred.<br> <br> Ithought: your purpose –<br> To show an adult's pride.<br> Ithought it's not possible:<br> Love, as one loves a bride.<br> <br> I was wrong in every way.<br> When the weather grew icy,<br> Everywhere, and always,<br> You followed, impassively,<br> <br> As if you wanted to show<br> I'd no love for you. Forgive!<br> Why did you take that vow<br> On the path to suffering?<br> <br> And death held out its hand…oh,<br> Speak, why then, what for?<br> I didn't know how frail your throat<br> Was under the blue collar.<br> <br> Happy boy, my tormented<br> Owlet, oh, forgive me!<br> Today, I find it hard<br> To leave this sanctuary.<br></p>

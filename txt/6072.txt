<p><cite class="al-title">A Fable for Critics</cite>, subtitled, "A Glance at a Few of Our Literary Progenies" was one of Lowell's most popular poems, a book-length farcical literary satire directed at popular American authors, including <a href="/author/ralph-waldo-emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> and <a href="/author/james-fenimore-cooper">James Fenimore Cooper</a>. He includes himself in his mudslinging, describing Lowell as having difficulty determining the difference "'twixt singing and preaching." First published anonymously in 1848, Lowell's authorship is revealed in the subsequent editions. <br>Recently released on Amazon, <cite class="al-title"><a href="http://americanliteraryblog.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html">Rob Velella</a></cite>'s updated edition with typo corrections and new footnotes: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fable-Critics-Original-1848-Satire/dp/198539104X">A Fable for Critics: The Original 1848 Satire</a>.</p><p><a href="introduction">Introduction</a></p><p><a href="a-fable-for-critics">A Fable for Critics</a></p><p><a href="through-his-babyhood-no-kind-of-pleasure-he-took">Through his babyhood no kind of pleasure he took</a></p><p><a href="id-apologize-here-for-my-many-digressions">I'd apologize here for my many digressions</a></p><p><a href="yonder-calm-as-a-cloud-alcott-stalks-in-a-dream">Yonder, calm as a cloud, Alcott stalks in a dream </a></p><p><a href="there-is-whittier-whose-swelling-and-vehement-heart">There is Whittier, whose swelling and vehement heart</a></p><p><a href="miranda-meanwhile-has-succeed-in-driving">Miranda meanwhile has succeed in driving</a></p><p><a href="but-my-good-mother-baystate-wants-no-praise-of-mine">But my good mother Baystate wants no praise of mine</a></p><p><a href="footnotes">Footnotes</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/james-russell-lowell">James Russell Lowell</a> library. </p>

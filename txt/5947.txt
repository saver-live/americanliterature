<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron Castine of St. Castine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has left his chateau in the Pyrenees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sailed across the western seas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went away from his fair demesne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds were building, the woods were green;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the winds of winter blow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the turrets of the old chateau,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds are silent and unseen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves lie dead in the ravine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Pyrenees are white with snow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father, lonely, old, and gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sits by the fireside day by day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking ever one thought of care;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the southern windows, narrow and tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines into the ancient hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes a glory round his hair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house-dog, stretched beneath his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groans in his sleep as if in pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then wakes, and yawns, and sleeps again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So silent is it everywhere,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So silent you can hear the mouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run and rummage along the beams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the wainscot of the wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old man rouses from his dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wanders restless through the house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he heard strange voices call.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His footsteps echo along the floor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a distant passage, and pause awhile;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing by an open door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking long, with a sad, sweet smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room of his absent son.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the bed on which he lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the pictures bright and gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horses and hounds and sun-lit seas;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are his powder-flask and gun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his hunting-knives in shape of a fan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair by the window where he sat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the clouded tiger-skin for a mat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out on the Pyrenees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out on Mount Marbore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Seven Valleys of Lavedan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! he turns away and sighs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mist before his eyes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night whatever the weather be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind or rain or starry heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the clock is striking seven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who look from the windows see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village Curate, with lantern and maid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come through the gateway from the park
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cross the courtyard damp and dark,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of light in a ring of shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now at the old man's side he stands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is cheery, his heart expands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gossips pleasantly, by the blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fire of fagots, about old days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cardinal Mazarin and the Fronde,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Cardinal's nieces fair and fond,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what they did, and what they said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they heard his Eminence was dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after a pause the old man says,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind still coming back again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the one sad thought that haunts his brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are there any tidings from over sea?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, why has that wild boy gone from me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Curate answers, looking down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless and docile as a lamb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young blood! young blood!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must so be!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And draws from the pocket of his gown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A handkerchief like an oriflamb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wipes his spectacles, and they play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their little game of lansquenet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence for an hour or so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the clock at nine strikes loud and clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the village lying asleep below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And across the courtyard, into the dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the winding pathway in the park,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curate and lantern disappear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And darkness reigns in the old chateau.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship has come back from over sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been signalled from below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into the harbor of Bordeaux
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sails with her gallant company.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But among them is nowhere seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brave young Baron of St. Castine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath tarried behind, I ween,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beautiful land of Acadie!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the father paces to and fro
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the chambers of the old chateau,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting, waiting to hear the hum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wheels on the road that runs below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of servants hurrying here and there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice in the courtyard, the step on the stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for some one who doth not come!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But letters there are, which the old man reads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Curate, when he comes at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Word by word, as an acolyte
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeats his prayers and tells his beads;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letters full of the rolling sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of a young man's joy to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abroad in the world, alone and free;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of adventures and wonderful scenes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hunting the deer through forests vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the royal grant of Pierre du Gast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nights in the tents of the Tarratines;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Madocawando the Indian chief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his daughters, glorious as queens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beautiful beyond belief;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so soft the tones of their native tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words are not spoken, they are sung!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Curate listens, and smiling says:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah yes, dear friend! in our young days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have liked to hunt the deer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day amid those forest scenes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to sleep in the tents of the Tarratines;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it is better sitting here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within four walls, and without the fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of losing our hearts to Indian queens;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For man is fire and woman is tow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Somebody comes and begins to blow."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a gleam of distrust and vague surmise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines in the father's gentle eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fire-light on a window-pane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glimmers and vanishes again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But naught he answers; he only sighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for a moment bows his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as their custom is, they play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their little gain of lansquenet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another day is with the dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another day, and many a day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a week and month depart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a fatal letter wings its way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the sea, like a bird of prey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strikes and tears the old man's heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the young Baron of St. Castine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift as the wind is, and as wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has married a dusky Tarratine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has married Madocawando's child!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter drops from the father's hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the sinews of his heart are wrung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He utters no cry, he breathes no prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No malediction falls from his tongue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his stately figure, erect and grand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bends and sinks like a column of sand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whirlwind of his great despair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying, yes, dying!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His latest breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of parley at the door of death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a blessing on his wayward son.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower and lower on his breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinks his gray head; he is at rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer he waits for any one;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many a year the old chateau
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies tenantless and desolate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rank grasses in the courtyard grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About its gables caws the crow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the porter at the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is left to guard it, and to wait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming of the rightful heir;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other life or sound is there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more the Curate comes at night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more is seen the unsteady light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threading the alleys of the park;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows of the hall are dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chambers dreary, cold, and bare!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length, at last, when the winter is past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And birds are building, and woods are green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flying skirts is the Curate seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speeding along the woodland way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humming gayly, "No day is so long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it comes at last to vesper-song."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stops at the porter's lodge to say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at last the Baron of St. Castine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is coming home with his Indian queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is coming without a week's delay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the house must be swept and clean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all things set in good array!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the solemn porter shakes his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the answer he makes is: "Lackaday!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will see, as the blind man said!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alert since first the day began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cock upon the village church
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks northward from his airy perch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if beyond the ken of man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the ships come sailing on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pass the isle of Oleron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pass the Tower of Cordouan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church below is cold in clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart that would have leaped for joy--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O tender heart of truth and trust!--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the coming of that day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church below the lips are dust;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust are the hands, and dust the feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would have been so swift to meet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming of that wayward boy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night the front of the old chateau
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a blaze of light above and below;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a sound of wheels and hoofs in the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cracking of whips, and scamper of feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bells are ringing, and horns are blown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Baron hath come again to his own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Curate is waiting in the hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most eager and alive of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To welcome the Baron and Baroness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his mind is full of vague distress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he hath read in Jesuit books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those children of the wilderness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, good, simple man! he looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see a painted savage stride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room, with shoulders bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eagle feathers in her hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around her a robe of panther's hide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, he beholds with secret shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A form of beauty undefined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loveliness with out a name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not of degree, but more of kind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor bold nor shy, nor short nor tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a new mingling of them all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, beautiful beyond belief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfigured and transfused, he sees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady of the Pyrenees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter of the Indian chief.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the shadow of her hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold-bronze color of the skin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems lighted by a fire within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when a burst of sunlight shines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a sombre grove of pines,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dusky splendor in the air.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two small hands, that now are pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his, seem made to be caressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They lie so warm and soft and still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like birds half hidden in a nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trustful, and innocent of ill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ah! he cannot believe his ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When her melodious voice he hears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking his native Gascon tongue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words she utters seem to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of some poem of Goudouli,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not spoken, they are sung!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Baron smiles, and says, "You see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told you but the simple truth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, you may trust the eyes of youth!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in the village day by day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people gossip in their way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stare to see the Baroness pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday morning to early Mass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when she kneeleth down to pray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wonder, and whisper together, and say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely this is no heathen lass!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in course of time they learn to bless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron and the Baroness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in course of time the Curate learns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secret so dreadful, that by turns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ice and fire, he freezes and burns.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron at confession hath said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That though this woman be his wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bath wed her as the Indians wed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath bought her for a gun and a knife!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Curate replies: "O profligate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Prodigal Son! return once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the open arms and the open door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Church, or ever it be too late.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God, thy father did not live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see what he could not forgive;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thee, so reckless and perverse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left his blessing, not his curse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nearer the dawn the darker the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by going wrong all things come right;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have been mended that were worse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the worse, the nearer they are to mend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of the living and the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt be wed as Christians wed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all things come to a happy end."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sun, that followest the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yon blue sky, serene and pure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pourest thine impartial light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike on mountain and on moor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause for a moment in thy course,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bless the bridegroom and the bride!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Gave, that from thy hidden source
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In you mysterious mountain-side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuest thy wandering way alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaping down its steps of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the meadow-lands demure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stealest away to the Adour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause for a moment in thy course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bless the bridegroom and the bride!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choir is singing the matin song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors of the church are opened wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people crowd, and press, and throng
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the bridegroom and the bride.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They enter and pass along the nave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stand upon the father's grave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells are ringing soft and slow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living above and the dead below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give their blessing on one and twain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm wind blows from the hills of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds are building, the leaves are green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Baron Castine of St. Castine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath come at last to his own again.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FINALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nunc plaudite!" the Student cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had finished; "now applaud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Roman actors used to say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of a play";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rose, and spread his hands abroad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiling bowed from side to side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who bears the palm away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And generous was the applause and loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But less for him than for the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That even as the tale was done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst from its canopy of cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lit the landscape with the blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of afternoon on autumn days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled the room with light, and made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of logs a painted shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden wind from out the west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew all its trumpets loud and shrill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows rattled with the blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oak-trees shouted as it passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight, as if by fear possessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud encampment on the hill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke up, and fluttering flag and tent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished into the firmament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the valley fled amain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear of the retreating rain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only far up in the blue sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mass of clouds, like drifted snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffused with a faint Alpine glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heaped together, vast and high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which a shattered rainbow hung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not rising like the ruined arch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some aerial aqueduct,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like a roseate garland plucked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an Olympian god, and flung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside in his triumphal march.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like prisoners from their dungeon gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like birds escaping from a snare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like school-boys at the hour of play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All left at once the pent-up room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rushed into the open air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no more tales were told that day.

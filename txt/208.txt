<p>From my poor sins I am set free.<br> In lilac dusk the taper smolders;<br> The dark stole's rigid drapery<br> Conceals a massive head and shoulders.<br> <br> "Talitha kumi": Is it He<br> Once more? How fast the heart is beating . . .<br> A touch: a hand moves absently<br> The customary cross repeating.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 혩listed at home for a lancer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 혩listed at home for a lancer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ride on a horse to my grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the seas we were bidden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country to take and to keep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far with the brave I have ridden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now with the brave I shall sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For round me the men will be lying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That learned me the way to behave.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And showed me my business of dying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ask and there is not an answer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says I, I will 혩list for a lancer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I with the brave shall be sleeping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ease on my mattress of loam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When back from their taking and keeping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron is riding home.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind with the plumes will be playing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls will stand watching them wave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eyeing my comrades and saying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ask and there is not an answer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says you, I will 혩list for a lancer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient town of Bruges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quaint old Flemish city,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the evening shades descended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low and loud and sweetly blended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low at times and loud at times,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And changing like a poet's rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang the beautiful wild chimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Belfry in the market
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the ancient town of Bruges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with deep sonorous clangor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calmly answering their sweet anger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wrangling bells had ended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly struck the clock eleven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, from out the silent heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence on the town descended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence, silence everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the earth and in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save that footsteps here and there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some burgher home returning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the street lamps faintly burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment woke the echoes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the ancient town of Bruges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But amid my broken slumbers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still I heard those magic numbers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they loud proclaimed the flight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stolen marches of the night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till their chimes in sweet collision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled with each wandering vision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled with the fortune-telling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gypsy-bands of dreams and fancies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which amid the waste expanses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the silent land of trances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have their solitary dwelling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All else seemed asleep in Bruges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quaint old Flemish city.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I thought how like these chimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the poet's airy rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his rhymes and roundelays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His conceits, and songs, and ditties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the belfry of his brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered downward, though in vain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the roofs and stones of cities!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For by night the drowsy ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under its curtains cannot hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by day men go their ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the music as they pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But deeming it no more, alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the hollow sound of brass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet perchance a sleepless wight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lodging at some humble inn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the narrow lanes of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dusk and hush of night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut out the incessant din
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of daylight and its toil and strife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May listen with a calm delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the poet's melodies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he hears, or dreams he hears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermingled with the song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts that he has cherished long;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hears amid the chime and singing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells of his own village ringing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wakes, and finds his slumberous eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet with most delicious tears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus dreamed I, as by night I lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bruges, at the Fleur-de-Ble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening with a wild delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the chimes that, through the night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang their changes from the Belfry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that quaint old Flemish city.

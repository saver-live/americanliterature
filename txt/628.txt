<p>Down the blue mountain in the evening, <br> Moonlight was my homeward escort. <br> Looking back, I saw my path <br> Lie in levels of deep shadow.... <br> I was passing the farm-house of a friend, <br> When his children called from a gate of thorn <br> And led me twining through jade bamboos <br> Where green vines caught and held my clothes. <br> And I was glad of a chance to rest <br> And glad of a chance to drink with my friend.... <br> We sang to the tune of the wind in the pines; <br> And we finished our songs as the stars went down, <br> When, I being drunk and my friend more than happy, <br> Between us we forgot the world. <br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majesty that shuts his burning eye;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak lay hand on what the strong has done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till that be tumbled that was lifted high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And discord follow upon unison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all things at one common level lie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore, friend, if your great race were run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these things came, so much the more thereby
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you made greatness your companion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it be for children that you sigh:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majesty that shuts his burning eye.

<p><i>ALL so grave and shining see they come<br> From the blissful ranks of the forgiven,<br> Though so distant wheels the nearest crystal dome,<br> And the spheres are seven.</i><br> <br> Are you in such haste to come to earth,<br> Shining ones, the Wonder on your brow,<br> To the low poor places of your birth,<br> And the day that must be darkness now?<br> <br> Does the heart still crave the spot it yearned on<br> In the grey and mortal years,<br> The pure flame the smoky hearth it burned on,<br> The clear eye its tears?<br> <br> Was there, in the narrow range of living,<br> After all the wider scope?<br> In the old old rapture of forgiving,<br> In the long long flight of hope?<br> <br> Come you, from free sweep across the spaces,<br> To the irksome bounds of mortal law,<br> From the all-embracing Vision, to some face's<br> Look that never saw?<br> <br> Never we, imprisoned here, had sought you,<br> Lured you with the ancient bait of pain,<br> Down the silver current of the light-years brought you<br> To the beaten round again--<br> <br> Is it you, perchance, who ache to strain us<br> Dumbly to the dim transfigured breast,<br> Or with tragic gesture would detain us<br> From the age-long search for rest?<br> <br> Is the labour then more glorious than the laurel,<br> The learning than the conquered thought?<br> Is the meed of men the righteous quarrel,<br> Not the justice wrought?<br> <br> Long ago we guessed it, faithful ghosts,<br> Proudly chose the present for our scene,<br> And sent out indomitable hosts<br> Day by day to widen our demesne.<br> <br> Sit you by our hearth-stone, lone immortals,<br> Share again the bitter wine of life!<br> Well we know, beyond the peaceful portals<br> There is nothing better than our strife,<br> <br> Nought more thrilling than the cry that calls us,<br> Spent and stumbling, to the conflict vain,<br> After each disaster that befalls us<br> Nerves us for a sterner strain.<br> <br> And, when flood or foeman shakes the sleeper<br> In his moment's lapse from pain,<br> Bids us fold our tents, and flee our kin, and deeper<br> Drive into the wilderness again.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less you want your toes trod off you'd better get back at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bullocks are walking two by two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The byles are walking two by two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the elephants bring the guns.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho! Yuss!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, big, long, black, forty-pounder guns.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiggery jolty to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each as big as a launch in tow, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind, dumb, broad-breeched, beggars o battering-guns.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lord the Elephant.

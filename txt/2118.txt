<p>HE that cannot choose but love,<br> And strives against it still,<br> Never shall my fancy move,<br> For he loves against his will;<br> Nor he which is all his own,<br> And cannot pleasure choose;<br> When I am caught he can be gone,<br> And when he list refuse;<br> Nor he that loves none but fair,<br> For such by all are sought;<br> Nor he that can for foul ones care,<br> For his judgement then is nought;<br> Nor he that hath wit, for he<br> Will make me his jest or slave;<br> Nor a fool when others —<br> He can neither —<br> Nor he that still his mistress prays,<br> For she is thrall'd therefore;<br> Nor he that pays, not, for he says<br> Within, she's worth no more.<br> Is there then no kind of men<br> Whom I may freely prove?<br> I will vent that humour then<br> In mine own self-love.</p>

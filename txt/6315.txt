<em>An idealized Portrait, by E. Vedder, in the Spring Exhibition of the National Academy, 1865<em>!

The sufferance of her race is shown,
  And retrospect of life,
Which now too late deliverance dawns upon;
  Yet is she not at strife.
Her children's children they shall know
  The good withheld from her;
And so her reverie takes prophetic cheerâ€”
  In spirit she sees the stir.
Far down the depth of thousand years,
  And marks the revel shine;
Her dusky face is lit with sober light,
  Sibylline, yet benign.

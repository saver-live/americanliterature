<pre>I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haydon! forgive me that I cannot speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitively of these mighty things;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me, that I have not eagle's wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That what I want I know not where to seek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think that I would not be over-meek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rolling out upfollowed thunderings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to the steep of Heliconian springs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were I of ample strength for such a freak.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think, too, that all these numbers should be thine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose else? In this who touch thy vesture's hem?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, when men stared at what was most divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With brainless idiotism and o'erwise phlegm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hadst beheld the full Hesperian shine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their star in the east, and gone to worship them.

II.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>On Seeing The Elgin Marbles.</i>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My spirit is too weak, mortality
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighs heavily upon me like unwilling sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each imagined pinnacle and steep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I have not the cloudy winds to keep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh for the opening of the morning's eye.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such dim-conceived glories of the brain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring round the heart an undescribable feud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasting of old Time, with a billowy main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sun, a shadow of a magnitude.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hads't thou stayed, I must have fled!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the Vision said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his chamber all alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneeling on the floor of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayed the Monk in deep contrition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his sins of indecision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayed for greater self-denial
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In temptation and in trial;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was noonday by the dial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Monk was all alone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, as if it lightened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unwonted splendor brightened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All within him and without him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that narrow cell of stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he saw the Blessed Vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our Lord, with light Elysian
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a vesture wrapped about him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a garment round him thrown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as crucified and slain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in agonies of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not with bleeding hands and feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Monk his Master see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as in the village street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house or harvest-field,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halt and lame and blind he healed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked in Galilee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attitude imploring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands upon his bosom crossed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondering, worshipping, adoring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt the Monk in rapture lost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am I, that thus thou deignest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reveal thyself to me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am I, that from the centre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy glory thou shouldst enter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poor cell, my guest to be?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then amid his exaltation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud the convent bell appalling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its belfry calling, calling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang through court and corridor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With persistent iteration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had never heard before.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was now the appointed hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When alike in shine or shower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter's cold or summer's heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the convent portals came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the blind and halt and lame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the beggars of the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For their daily dole of food
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealt them by the brotherhood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their almoner was he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who upon his bended knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapt in silent ecstasy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of divinest self-surrender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the Vision and the Splendor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep distress and hesitation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled with his adoration;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he go, or should he stay?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he leave the poor to wait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry at the convent gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the Vision passed away?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he slight his radiant guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slight this visitant celestial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a crowd of ragged, bestial
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggars at the convent gate?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Vision there remain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Vision come again?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a voice within his breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered, audible and clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to the outward ear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do thy duty; that is best;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave unto thy Lord the rest!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway to his feet he started,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with longing look intent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Blessed Vision bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly from his cell departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly on his errand went.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gate the poor were waiting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking through the iron grating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that terror in the eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is only seen in those
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who amid their wants and woes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the sound of doors that close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of feet that pass them by;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown familiar with disfavor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown familiar with the savor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bread by which men die!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to-day, they knew not why,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the gate of Paradise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed the convent sate to rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sacrament divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to them the bread and wine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart the Monk was praying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the homeless poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they suffer and endure;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we see not, what we see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the inward voice was saying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whatsoever thing thou doest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the least of mine and lowest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou doest unto me!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto me! but had the Vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to him in beggar's clothing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come a mendicant imploring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he then have knelt adoring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or have listened with derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have turned away with loathing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus his conscience put the question,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of troublesome suggestion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at length, with hurried pace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards his cell he turned his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beheld the convent bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a supernatural light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a luminous cloud expanding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over floor and wall and ceiling.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he paused with awe-struck feeling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the threshold of his door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Vision still was standing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he left it there before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the convent bell appalling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its belfry calling, calling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned him to feed the poor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the long hour intervening
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had waited his return,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he felt his bosom burn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehending all the meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Blessed Vision said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All praised the Legend more or less;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some liked the moral, some the verse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some thought it better, and some worse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than other legends of the past;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until, with ill-concealed distress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all their cavilling, at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian gravely said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Spanish proverb, then, is right;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consult your friends on what you do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one will say that it is white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And others say that it is red."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Amen!" quoth the Spanish Jew.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six stories told!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have seven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cluster like the Pleiades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! it happens, as with these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That one is missing from our heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the Landlord?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring him here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Lost Pleiad reappear."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Sicilian cried, and went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith to seek his missing star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But did not find him in the bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place that landlords most frequent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet beside the kitchen fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor up the stairs, nor in the hall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in vain to ask or call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no tidings of the Squire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he came back with downcast head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclaiming: "Well, our bashful host
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath surely given up the ghost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another proverb says the dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can tell no tales; and that is true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows, then, that one of you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must tell a story in his stead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must," he to the Student said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who know so many of the best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell them better than the rest."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight by these flattering words beguiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student, happy as a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he is called a little man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumed the double task imposed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And without more ado unclosed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His smiling lips, and thus began.

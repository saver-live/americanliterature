<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shore of Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shining Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the doorway of his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant Summer morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha stood and waited.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the air was full of freshness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the earth was bright and joyous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before him, through the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward toward the neighboring forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed in golden swarms the Ahmo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed the bees, the honey-makers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burning, singing in the sunshine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright above him shone the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level spread the lake before him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its bosom leaped the sturgeon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkling, flashing in the sunshine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its margin the great forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood reflected in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every tree-top had its shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless beneath the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the brow of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone was every trace of sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fog from off the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the mist from off the meadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile of joy and triumph,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a look of exultation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of one who in a vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees what is to be, but is not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood and waited Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the sun his hands were lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the palms spread out against it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And between the parted fingers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the sunshine on his features,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flecked with light his naked shoulders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it falls and flecks an oak-tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the rifted leaves and branches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the water floating, flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something in the hazy distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something in the mists of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loomed and lifted from the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now seemed floating, now seemed flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming nearer, nearer, nearer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it Shingebis the diver?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the pelican, the Shada?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the white goose, Waw-be-wawa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the water dripping, flashing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its glossy neck and feathers?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was neither goose nor diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither pelican nor heron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the water floating, flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the shining mist of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a birch canoe with paddles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising, sinking on the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dripping, flashing in the sunshine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And within it came a people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the distant land of Wabun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the farthest realms of morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the Priest of Prayer, the Pale-face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his guides and his companions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the noble Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hands aloft extended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held aloft in sign of welcome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited, full of exultation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the birch canoe with paddles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grated on the shining pebbles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stranded on the sandy margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cross upon his bosom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landed on the sandy margin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the joyous Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried aloud and spake in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful is the sun, O strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you come so far to see us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our town in peace awaits you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our doors stand open for you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall enter all our wigwams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the heart's right hand we give you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never bloomed the earth so gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never shone the sun so brightly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to-day they shine and blossom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you come so far to see us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never was our lake so tranquil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor so free from rocks, and sand-bars;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your birch canoe in passing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has removed both rock and sand-bar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never before had our tobacco
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a sweet and pleasant flavor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never the broad leaves of our cornfields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were so beautiful to look on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they seem to us this morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you come so far to see us!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Black-Robe chief made answer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stammered in his speech a little,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking words yet unfamiliar:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peace be with you, Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace be with you and your people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace of prayer, and peace of pardon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace of Christ, and joy of Mary!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the generous Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led the strangers to his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated them on skins of bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated them on skins of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the careful old Nokomis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought them food in bowls of basswood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water brought in birchen dippers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the calumet, the peace-pipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled and lighted for their smoking.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the old men of the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the warriors of the nation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians, the Wabenos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Medicine-men, the Medas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to bid the strangers welcome;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is well", they said, "O brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you come so far to see us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a circle round the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their pipes they sat in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting to behold the strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting to receive their message;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wigwam came to greet them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stammering in his speech a little,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking words yet unfamiliar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is well," they said, "O brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you come so far to see us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told his message to the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told the purport of his mission,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told them of the Virgin Mary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her blessed Son, the Saviour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How in distant lands and ages
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had lived on earth as we do;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he fasted, prayed, and labored;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Jews, the tribe accursed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mocked him, scourged him, crucified him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he rose from where they laid him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked again with his disciples,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ascended into heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chiefs made answer, saying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have listened to your message,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard your words of wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will think on what you tell us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well for us, O brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you come so far to see us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they rose up and departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one homeward to his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the young men and the women
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told the story of the strangers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom the Master of Life had sent them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shining land of Wabun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy with the heat and silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew the afternoon of Summer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a drowsy sound the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered round the sultry wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sound of sleep the water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rippled on the beach below it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the guests of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary with the heat of Summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slumbered in the sultry wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly o'er the simmering landscape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell the evening's dusk and coolness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the long and level sunbeams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot their spears into the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking through its shields of shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed into each secret ambush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searched each thicket, dingle, hollow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the guests of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slumbered in the silent wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his place rose Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade farewell to old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake in whispers, spake in this wise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not wake the guests, that slumbered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going, O Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a long and distant journey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the portals of the Sunset.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the regions of the home-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these guests I leave behind me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your watch and ward I leave them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See that never harm comes near them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See that never fear molests them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never danger nor suspicion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never want of food or shelter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lodge of Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth into the village went he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade farewell to all the warriors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade farewell to all the young men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake persuading, spake in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going, O my people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a long and distant journey;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many moons and many winters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will have come, and will have vanished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere I come again to see you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my guests I leave behind me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to their words of wisdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the truth they tell you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Master of Life has sent them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of light and morning!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore stood Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned and waved his hand at parting;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the clear and luminous water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launched his birch canoe for sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the pebbles of the margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoved it forth into the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered to it, "Westward! westward!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with speed it darted forward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the evening sun descending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the clouds on fire with redness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned the broad sky, like a prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left upon the level water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One long track and trail of splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down whose stream, as down a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward, westward Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed into the fiery sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed into the purple vapors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed into the dusk of evening:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people from the margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched him floating, rising, sinking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the birch canoe seemed lifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High into that sea of splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it sank into the vapors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the new moon slowly, slowly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking in the purple distance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they said, "Farewell forever!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the forests, dark and lonely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved through all their depths of darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the waves upon the margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising, rippling on the pebbles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobbed, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her haunts among the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screamed, "Farewell, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus departed Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha the Beloved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glory of the sunset,.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the purple mists of evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the regions of the home-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Islands of the Blessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Land of the Hereafter!

<p>A bright moon rising above Tian Shan Mountain,<br> Lost in a vast ocean of clouds.<br> The long wind, across thousands upon thousands of miles,<br> Blows past the Jade-gate Pass.<br> The army of Han has gone down the Baiteng Road,<br> As the barbarian hordes probe at Qinghai Bay.<br> It is known that from the battlefield<br> Few ever live to return.<br> Men at Garrison look on the border scene,<br> Home thoughts deepen sorrow on their faces.<br> In the towered chambers tonight,<br> Ceaseless are the women's sighs. <br></p>

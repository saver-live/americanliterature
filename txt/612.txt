<p>A slip of the moon hangs over the capital; <br> Ten thousand washing-mallets are pounding; <br> And the autumn wind is blowing my heart <br> For ever and ever toward the Jade Pass.... <br> Oh, when will the Tartar troops be conquered, <br> And my husband come back from the long campaign! <br></p>

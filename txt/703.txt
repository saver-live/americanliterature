<p>Many miles beyond Rome there was a famous country which we call Greece. The people of Greece were not u-nit-ed like the Romans; but instead there were sev-er-al states, each of which had its own rulers.</p><p>Some of the people in the southern part of the country were called Spar-tans, and they were noted for their simple habits and their brav-er-y. The name of their land was La-co´ni-a, and so they were sometimes called La-cons.</p><p>One of the strange rules which the Spartans had, was that they should speak briefly, and never use more words than were needed. And so a short answer is often spoken of as being _la-con-ic_; that is, as being such an answer as a Lacon would be likely to give.</p><p>There was in the northern part of Greece a land called Mac´e-don; and this land was at one time ruled over by a war-like king named Philip.</p><p>Philip of Mac-e-don wanted to become the master of all Greece. So he raised a great army, and made war upon the other states, until nearly all of them were forced to call him their king. Then he sent a letter to the Spartans in La-co-ni-a, and said, "If I go down into your country, I will level your great city to the ground."</p><p>In a few days, an answer was brought back to him. When he opened the letter, he found only one word written there.</p><p>That word was "IF."</p><p>It was as much as to say, "We are not afraid of you so long as the little word 'if' stands in your way."</p><p></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Terence, this is stupid stuff:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You eat your victuals fast enough;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can't be much amiss, 'tis clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the rate you drink your beer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh, good Lord, the verse you make,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives a chap the belly-ache.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cow, the old cow, she is dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sleeps well, the horned head:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We poor lads, 'tis our turn now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear such tunes as killed the cow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty friendship 'tis to rhyme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your friends to death before their time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moping melancholy mad:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, pipe a tune to dance to, lad."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, if 'tis dancing you would be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's brisker pipes than poetry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, for what were hop-yards meant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or why was Burton built on Trent?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh many a peer of England brews
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Livelier liquor than the Muse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And malt does more than Milton can
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To justify God's ways to man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fellows whom it hurts to think:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look into the pewter pot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the world as the world's not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faith, 'tis pleasant till 'tis past:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mischief is that 'twill not last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I have been to Ludlow fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left my necktie God knows where,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carried half-way home, or near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the world seemed none so bad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I myself a sterling lad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down in lovely muck I've lain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy till I woke again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I saw the morning sky:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heigho, the tale was all a lie;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world, it was the old world yet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was I, my things were wet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing now remained to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But begin the game anew.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, since the world has still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much good, but much less good than ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while the sun and moon endure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd face it as a wise man would,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And train for ill and not for good.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis true the stuff I bring for sale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not so brisk a brew as ale:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of a stem that scored the hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrung it in a weary land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But take it: if the smack is sour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better for the embittered hour;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should do good to heart and head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your soul is in my soul's stead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will friend you, if I may,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark and cloudy day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a king reigned in the East:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, when kings will sit to feast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They get their fill before they think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With poisoned meat and poisoned drink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gathered all that springs to birth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the many-venomed earth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First a little, thence to more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sampled all her killing store;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And easy, smiling, seasoned sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sate the king when healths went round.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put arsenic in his meat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stared aghast to watch him eat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They poured strychnine in his cup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook to see him drink it up:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shook, they stared as white's their shirt:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them it was their poison hurt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-I tell the tale that I heard told.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mithridates, he died old.

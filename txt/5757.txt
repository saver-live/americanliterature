<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, Haroun Al Raschid read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book wherein the poet said:--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are the kings, and where the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who once the world possessed?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They're gone with all their pomp and show,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're gone the way that thou shalt go.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O thou who choosest for thy share
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world, and what the world calls fair,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take all that it can give or lend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But know that death is at the end!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haroun Al Raschid bowed his head:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears fell upon the page he read.

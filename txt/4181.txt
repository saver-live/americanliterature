<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is love? It is a doll dress'd up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For idleness to cosset, nurse, and dandle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing of soft misnomers, so divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That silly youth doth think to make itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine by loving, nad so goes on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yawning and doting a whole summer long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Miss's comb is made a perfect tiara,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And common Wellingtons turn Romeo boots;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Cleopatra lives at number seven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Antony resides in Brunswick Square.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fools! if some passions high have warm'd the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Queens and Soldiers have play'd deep for hearts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no reason why such agonies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should be more common than the growth of weeds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fools! make me whole again that weighty pearl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Egypt melted, and I'll say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ye may love in spite of beaver hats.

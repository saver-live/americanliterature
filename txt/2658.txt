'When I was just as far as I could walk 
From here today,
There was an hour 
All still 
When leaning with my head against a flower 
I heard you talk. 
Don't say I didn't, for I heard you say-- 
You spoke from that flower on the window sill- 
Do you remember what it was you said?' 

'First tell me what it was you thought you heard.' 

'Having found the flower and driven a bee away, 
I leaned on my head 
And holding by the stalk, 
I listened and I thought I caught the word-- 
What was it? Did you call me by my name? 
Or did you say-- 
<i>Someone</i> said "Come" -- I heard it as I bowed.' 

'I may have thought as much, but not aloud.' 

"Well, so I came.'

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Downs, in the Weald, on the Marshes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Old Gods say:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here come Very Many People:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must go away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They take our land to delight in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their delight destroys.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They flay the turf from the sheep-walk.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They load the Denes with noise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They burn coal in the woodland.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seize the oast and the mill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They camp beside Our dew-ponds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They mar the clean-flanked hill.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They string a clamorous Magic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fence their souls from thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Our deep-breathed Oaks are silent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Our muttering Downs tell nought.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They comfort themselves with neighbours.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot bide alone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be best for their doings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When We Old Gods are gone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to the Downs and the Marshes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Weald and the Forest known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before there were Very Many People,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Old Gods had gone!

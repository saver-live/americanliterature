<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lived in storm and strife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her soul had such desire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what proud death may bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it could not endure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common good of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lived as Â’twere a king
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That packed his marriage day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With banneret and pennon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trumpet and kettledrum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the outrageous cannon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bundle time away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the night come.
</pre>

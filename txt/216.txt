<p>Ispeak those words, today, that come<br> Only once, born in the spirit.<br> Bees hum on white chrysanthemum:<br> There's the must of an old sachet.<br> <br> And the room, with narrow windows,<br> Preserves love, remembers the past.<br> Over the bed a French script flows:<br> It reads: 'Lord, have mercy on us.'<br> <br> Those saddened marks of so ancient a tale,<br> You mustn't touch, my heart, or seek to…<br> Isee bright Sèvres statuettes grow pale:<br> Even as their lustre grows duller too.<br> <br> A last ray, yellow, heavy,<br> Sets on the dahlias' bright bouquet,<br> And I can hear viols playing,<br> A clavichord's rare display.<br></p>

<p>O WIFE, wife, wife! As if the sacred name<br> Could weary one with saying! Once again<br> Laying against my brow your lips' soft flame,<br> Join with me, Sweetest, in love's new refrain,<br> Since the whole music of my late-found life<br> Is that we call each other "husband -- wife."<br> <br> And yet, stand back, and let your cloth of gold<br> Straighten its sumptuous lines from waist to knee,<br> And, flowing firmly outward, fold on fold,<br> Invest your slim young form with majesty<br> As when, in those calm bridal robes arrayed,<br> You stood beside me, and I was afraid.<br> <br> I was afraid -- O sweetness, whiteness, youth,<br> Best gift of God, I feared you! I, indeed,<br> For whom all womanhood has been, forsooth,<br> Summed up in the sole Virgin of the Creed,<br> I thought that day our Lady's self stood there<br> And bound herself to me with vow and prayer.<br> <br> Ah, yes, that day. I sat, remember well,<br> Half-crook'd above a missal, and laid in<br> The gold-leaf slowly; silence in my cell;<br> The picture, Satan tempting Christ to sin<br> Upon the mount's blue, pointed pinnacle,<br> The world outspread beneath as fair as hell --<br> <br> When suddenly they summoned me. I stood<br> Abashed before the Abbot, who reclined<br> Full-bellied in his chair beneath the rood,<br> And roseate with having lately dined;<br> And then -- I standing there abashed -- he said:<br> "The house of Giustiniani all lie dead."<br> <br> It scarcely seemed to touch me (I had led<br> A grated life so long) that oversea<br> My kinsmen in their knighthood should lie dead,<br> Nor that this sudden death should set me free,<br> Me, the last Giustiniani -- well, what then?<br> A monk! -- The Giustiniani had been men.<br> <br> So when the Abbot said: "The state decrees<br> That you, the latest scion of the house<br> Which died in vain for Venice overseas,<br> Should be exempted from your sacred vows,<br> And straightway, when you leave this cloistered place,<br> Take wife, and add new honors to the race,"<br> <br> I hardly heard him -- would have crept again<br> To the warped missal -- but he snatched a sword<br> And girded me, and all the heart of men<br> Rushed through me, as he laughed and hailed me lord,<br> And, with my hand upon the hilt, I cried,<br> "Viva San Marco!" like my kin who died.<br> <br> But, straightway, when, a new-made knight, I stood<br> Beneath the bridal arch, and saw you come,<br> A certain monkish warping of the blood<br> Ran up and struck the man's heart in me dumb;<br> I breathed an Ave to our Lady's grace,<br> And did not dare to look upon your face.<br> <br> And when we swept the waters side by side,<br> With timbrelled gladness clashing on the air,<br> I trembled at your image in the tide,<br> And warded off the devil with a prayer,<br> Still seeming in a golden dream to move<br> Through fiendish labyrinths of forbidden love.<br> <br> But when they left us, and we stood alone,<br> I, the last Giustiniani, face to face<br> With your unvisioned beauty, made my own<br> In this, the last strange bridal of our race,<br> And, looking up at last to meet your eyes,<br> Saw in their depths the star of love arise,<br> <br> Ah, then the monk's garb shrivelled from my heart,<br> And left me man to face your womanhood.<br> Without a prayer to keep our lips apart<br> I turned about and kissed you where you stood,<br> And gathering all the gladness of my life<br> Into a new-found word, I called you "wife!"</p>

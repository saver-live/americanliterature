<pre>(To the maiden with the hidden face in Abbeys painting)

The other maidens raised their eyes to him
Who stumbled in before them when the fight
Had left him victor, with a victors right.
I think his eyes with quick hot tears grew dim;
He scarcely saw her swaying white and slim,
And trembling slightly, dreaming of his might,
Nor knew he touched her hand, as strangely light
As a wan wraiths beside a rivers rim.
The other maidens raised their eyes to see
And only she has hid her face away,
And yet I ween she loved him more than they,
And very fairly fashioned was her face.
Yet for Loves shame and sweet humility,
She dared not meet him with their queen-like grace.

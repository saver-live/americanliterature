<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus in altemate uproar and sad peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazed were those Titans utterly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O leave them, Muse! O leave them to their woes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A solitary sorrow best befits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a fallen old Divinity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandering in vain about bewildered shores.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a wind of heaven but will breathe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For lo! 'tis for the Father of all verse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flush everything that hath a vermeil hue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the rose glow intense and warm the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the clouds of even and of morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the hills;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the red wine within the goblet boil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp'd shells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all their labyrinths; and let the maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hazels thick, dark-stemm'd beneath the shade:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo is once more the golden theme!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was he, when the Giant of the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together had he left his mother fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the morning twilight wandered forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the osiers of a rivulet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale had ceas'd, and a few stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Began calm-throated. Throughout all the isle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no covert, no retired cave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listen'd, and he wept, and his bright tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went trickling down the golden bow he held.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With solemn step an awful Goddess came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was purport in her looks for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he with eager guess began to read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perplex'd, the while melodiously he said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How cam'st thou over the unfooted sea?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hath that antique mien and robed form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mov'd in these vales invisible till now?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cool mid-forest. Surely I have traced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rustle of those ample skirts about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift up their heads, as still the whisper pass'd.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess! I have beheld those eyes before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their eternal calm, and all that face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I have dream'd." "Yes," said the supreme shape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou hast dream'd of me; and awaking up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose strings touch'd by thy fingers, all the vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwearied ear of the whole universe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such new tuneful wonder. Is't not strange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou shouldst weep, so gifted? Tell me, youth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sorrow thou canst feel; for I am sad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one who in this lonely isle hath been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the young day when first thy infant hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluck'd witless the weak flowers, till thine arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could bend that bow heroic to all times.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show thy heart's secret to an ancient Power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For prophecies of thee, and for the sake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of loveliness new born." Apollo then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus answer'd, while his white melodious throat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throbb'd with the syllables. "Mnemosyne!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy name is on my tongue, I know not how;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should I strive to show what from thy lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would come no mystery? For me, dark, dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strive to search wherefore I am so sad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a melancholy numbs my limbs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then upon the grass I sit, and moan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one who once had wings. O why should I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel curs'd and thwarted, when the liegeless air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yields to my step aspirant? why should I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess benign, point forth some unknown thing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there not other regions than this isle?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the stars? There is the sun, the sun!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most patient brilliance of the moon!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stars by thousands! Point me out the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any one particular beauteous star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will flit into it with my lyre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make its silvery splendor pant with bliss.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes this alarum in the elements,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I here idle listen on the shores
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fearless yet in aching ignorance?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O tell me, lonely Goddess, by thy harp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That waileth every morn and eventide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me why thus I rave about these groves!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mute thou remainest Mute! yet I can read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wondrous lesson in thy silent face:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge enormous makes a God of me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majesties, sovran voices, agonies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creations and destroyings, all at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour into the wide hollows of my brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deify me, as if some blithe wine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so become immortal." Thus the God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his enkindled eyes, with level glance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath his white soft temples, steadfast kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon wild commotions shook him, and made flush
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the immortal fairness of his limbs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like the struggle at the gate of death;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or liker still to one who should take leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pale immortal death, and with a pang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hot as death's is chill, with fierce convulse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Die into life: so young Apollo anguish'd:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His very hair, his golden tresses famed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept undulation round his eager neck.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the pain Mnemosyne upheld
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her arms as one who prophesied. At length
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo shriek'd; and lo! from all his limbs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celestial

<pre> I followed my Duke ere I was a lover,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take from England fief and fee;
 But now this game is the other way over,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now England hath taken me!

 I had my horse, my shield and banner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a boy's heart, so whole and free;
 But now I sing in another manner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now England hath taken me!

 As for my Father in his tower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking news of my ship at sea,
 He will remember his own hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell him England hath taken me!

 As for my Mother in her bower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rules my Father so cunningly,
 She will remember a maiden's power,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell her England hath taken me!

 As for my Brother in Rouen City,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nimble and naughty' page is he,
 But he will come to suffer and pity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell him England hath taken me!

 As for my little Sister waiting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pleasant orchards of Normandie,
 Tell her youth is the time for mating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell her England hath taken me!

 As for my comrades in camp and highway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lift their eyebrows scornfully,
 Tell them their way is not my way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell them England hath taken me!

 Kings and Princes and Barons famed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knights and Captains in your degree;
 Hear me a little before I am blamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing England hath taken me!

 Howso great man's strength be reckoned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two things he cannot flee.
 Love is the first, and Death is the second,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love in England hath taken me!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some beloved voice that was to you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sound and sweetness, faileth suddenly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silence, against which you dare not cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aches round you like a strong disease and new
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What hope? what help? what music will undo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That silence to your sense? Not friendship's sigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not reason's subtle count; not melody
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of viols, nor of pipes that Faunus blew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not songs of poets, nor of nightingales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose hearts leap upward through the cypress-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the clear moon; nor yet the spheric laws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-chanted, nor the angels' sweet 'All hails,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met in the smile of God: nay, none of these.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak thou, availing Christ! and fill this pause.
</pre>

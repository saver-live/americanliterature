<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors were wide, the story saith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the night came the patient wraith.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might not speak, and he could not stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hair of the Barons minniver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless and strengthless, a shadow thin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roved the castle to find his kin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh! twas a piteous sight to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dumb ghost follow his enemy!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Return of Imray.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my Spring I garnered Autumn's gain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of her time my field was white with grain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year gave up her secrets, to my woe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forced and deflowered each sick season lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mystery of increase and decay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the sunset ere men see the day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am too wise in all I should not know.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Benefit of Clergy.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theres a convict more in the Central Jail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the old mud wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theres a lifter less on the Border trail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Queen's Peace over all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear boys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queens Peace over all!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we must bear our leaders blame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On us the shame will fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we lift our hand from a fettered land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Queers Peace over all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear boys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queens Peace over all!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Head of the District.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earth gave up her dead that tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into our camp he came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said his say and went his way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left our hearts aflame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep tally, on the gun-butt score
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vengeance we must take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When God shall bring full reckoning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our dead comrades sake!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Man Who Was.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is lead, and our faces are red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Gates of Hell are opened and riven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the winds of Hell are loosened and driven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dust flies up in the face of Heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the clouds come down in a fiery sheet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy to raise and hard to be borne.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soul of man is turned from his meat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned from the trifles for which he has striven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick in his body and heavy-hearted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his soul flies up like the dust in the street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks from his flesh and is gone and departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the blasts that they blow on the cholera-horn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the End of the Passage.

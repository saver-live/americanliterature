<p>Death be not proud, though some have call√®d thee<br> Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so,<br> For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,<br> Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill me.<br> From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee,<br> Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow,<br> And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,<br> Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie.<br> Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men,<br> And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell,<br> And poppie, or charmes can make us sleepe as well,<br> And better than thy stroake; why swell'st thou then;<br> One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally,<br> And death shall be no more, death, thou shalt die.</p>

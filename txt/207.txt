<p>Broad gold, the evening colors glow,<br> The April air is cool and tender.<br> You should have come ten years ago,<br> And yet in welcome I surrender.<br> <br> Come here, sit closer in our nook,<br> And turn gay eyes at what my nurses<br> Might never glimpse: the blue-bound book<br> That holds my awkward childish verses.<br> <br> Forgive me that I did not look<br> Sunward with joy, but dwelt with sorrow,<br> Forgive me all whom I mistook<br> For you, oblivious of the morrow.</p>

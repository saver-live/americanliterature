<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time's sea hath been five years at its slow ebb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long hours have to and fro let creep the sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was tangled in thy beauty's web,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And snared by the ungloving of thine hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I never look on midnight sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I behold thine eyes' well memory'd light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot look upon the rose's dye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to thy cheek my soul doth take its flight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot look on any budding flower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my fond ear, in fancy at thy lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hearkening for a love-sound, doth devour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its sweets in the wrong sense: Thou dost eclipse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every delight with sweet remembering,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grief unto my darling joys dost bring.

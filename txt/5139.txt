<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the date that the doors of his prep-school close
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lonely little son
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is taught by precept, insult, and blows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Things that Are Never Done.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year after year, without favour or fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From seven to twenty-two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His keepers insist he shall learn the list
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the things no fellow can do.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(They are not so strict with the average Pict
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it isnt set to, etc.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this and not for the profit it brings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the good of his fellow-kind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is and suffers unspeakable things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In body and soul and mind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the net result of that Primitive Cult,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever else may be won,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is definite knowledge ere leaving College
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Things that Are Never Done.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(An interdict which is strange to the Pict
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was never revealed to, etc.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slack by training and slow by birth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only quick to despise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Largely assessing his neighbours worth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the hue of his socks or ties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loafer-in-grain, his foes maintain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how shall we combat their view
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, atop of his natural sloth, he holds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Things no Fellow can do?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Which is why he is licked from the first by the Pict
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left at the post by, etc.)

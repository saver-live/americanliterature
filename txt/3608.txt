<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the fields as we came by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago, my love and I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aspen over stile and stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was talking to itself alone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh who are these that kiss and pass?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country lover and his lass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two lovers looking to be wed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And time shall put them both to bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she shall lie with earth above,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he beside another love."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sure enough beneath the tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There walks another love with me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And overhead the aspen heaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its rainy-sounding silver leaves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I spell nothing in their stir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now perhaps they speak to her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plain for her to understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talk about a time at hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I shall sleep with clover clad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she beside another lad.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strange it seems!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Hebrews in their graves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by the street of this fair seaport town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent beside the never-silent waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At rest in all this moving up and down!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees are white with dust, that o'er their sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wave their broad curtains in the south-wind's breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While underneath such leafy tents they keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long, mysterious Exodus of Death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these sepulchral stones, so old and brown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pave with level flags their burial-place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem like the tablets of the Law, thrown down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And broken by Moses at the mountain's base.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very names recorded here are strange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of foreign accent, and of different climes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvares and Rivera interchange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Abraham and Jacob of old times.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blessed be God! for he created Death!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mourners said, "and Death is rest and peace";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then added, in the certainty of faith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And giveth Life that never more shall cease."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed are the portals of their Synagogue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Psalms of David now the silence break,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Rabbi reads the ancient Decalogue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the grand dialect the Prophets spake.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone are the living, but the dead remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not neglected; for a hand unseen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattering its bounty, like a summer rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still keeps their graves and their remembrance green.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How came they here?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What burst of Christian hate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What persecution, merciless and blind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove o'er the sea--that desert desolate--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Ishmaels and Hagars of mankind?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They lived in narrow streets and lanes obscure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghetto and Judenstrass, in mirk and mire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taught in the school of patience to endure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of anguish and the death of fire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All their lives long, with the unleavened bread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bitter herbs of exile and its fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wasting famine of the heart they fed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slaked its thirst with marah of their tears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anathema maranatha! was the cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rang from town to town, from street to street;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every gate the accursed Mordecai
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was mocked and jeered, and spurned by Christian feet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride and humiliation hand in hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked with them through the world where'er they went;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trampled and beaten were they as the sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet unshaken as the continent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For in the background figures vague and vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of patriarchs and of prophets rose sublime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the great traditions of the Past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw reflected in the coming time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus for ever with reverted look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystic volume of the world they read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spelling it backward, like a Hebrew book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till life became a Legend of the Dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ah! what once has been shall be no more!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groaning earth in travail and in pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings forth its races, but does not restore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dead nations never rise again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou still unravished bride of quietness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What leaf-fringÂ’d legend haunts about thy shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of deities or mortals, or of both,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, happy melodist, unwearied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever piping songs for ever new;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More happy love! more happy, happy love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever warm and still to be enjoyed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever panting, and for ever young;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All breathing human passion far above,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloyed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What little town by river or sea shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, little town, thy streets for evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With forest branches and the trodden weed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When old age shall this generation waste,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beauty is truth, truth beauty, -- that is all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

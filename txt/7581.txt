That is why he looks so innocent.<br> Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar on to this earth.<br> It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.<br> This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly helpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love.<br> Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny crescent moon.<br> It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.<br> He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little corner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught and pressed in her dear arms.<br> Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect bliss.<br> It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.<br> Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's yearning heart to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles weave the double bond of pity and love.</p>

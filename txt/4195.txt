<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood tip-toe upon a little hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air was cooling, and so very still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sweet buds which with a modest pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had not yet lost those starry diadems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught from the early sobbing of the morn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little noiseless noise among the leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born of the very sigh that silence heaves:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For not the faintest motion could be seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the shades that slanted oer the green.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was wide wandring for the greediest eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To peer about upon variety;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far round the horizons crystal air to skim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To picture out the quaint, and curious bending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a fresh woodland alley, never ending;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess where the jaunty streams refresh themselves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though the fanning wings of Mercury
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had played upon my heels: I was light-hearted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many pleasures to my vision started;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I straightway began to pluck a posey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bush of May flowers with the bees about them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let a lush laburnum oversweep them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moist, cool and green; and shade the violets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they may bind the moss in leafy nets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A filbert hedge with wildbriar overtwined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon their summer thrones; there too should be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent chequer of a youngling tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with a score of light green breth[r]en shoots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the quaint mossiness of aged roots:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spreading blue bells: it may haply mourn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such fair clusters should be rudely torn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By infant hands, left on the path to die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open afresh your round of starry folds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye ardent marigolds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry up the moisture from your golden lids,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For great Apollo bids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in these days your praises should be sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On many harps, which he has lately strung;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when again your dewiness he kisses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So haply when I rove in some far vale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mighty voice may come upon the gale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wings of gentle flush oer delicate white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taper fingers catching at all things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bind them all about with tiny rings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linger awhile upon some bending planks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lean against a streamlets rushy banks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch intently Natures gentle doings:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will be found softer than ring-doves cooings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How silent comes the water round that bend;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the minutest whisper does it send
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the oerhanging sallows: blades of grass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly across the chequerd shadows pass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A natural sermon oer their pebbly beds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where swarms of minnows show their little heads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staying their wavy bodies gainst the streams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To taste the luxury of sunny beams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperd with coolness. How they ever wrestle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you but scantily hold out the hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That very instant not one will remain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But turn your eye, and they are there again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cool themselves among the emrald tresses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while they cool themselves, they freshness give,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And moisture, that the bowery green may live:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So keeping up an interchange of favours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like good men in the truth of their behaviours.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From low hung branches; little space they stop;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then off at once, as in a wanton freak:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perhaps, to show their black, and golden wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing upon their yellow flutterings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were I in such a place, I sure should pray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nought less sweet, might call my thoughts away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the soft rustle of a maidens gown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanning away the dandelions down;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the light music of her nimble toes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patting against the sorrel as she goes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How she would start, and blush, thus to be caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing in all her innocence of thought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me lead her gently oer the brook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch her half-smiling lips, and downward look;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O let me for one moment touch her wrist;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me one moment to her breathing list;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as she leaves me may she often turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What next? A tuft of evening primroses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oer which the mind may hover till it dozes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oer which it well might take a pleasant sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that tis ever startled by the leap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by the moon lifting her silver rim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above a cloud, and with a gradual swim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming into the blue with all her light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Maker of sweet poets, dear delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this fair world, and all its gentle livers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lover of loneliness, and wandering,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of upcast eye, and tender pondering!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee must I praise above all other glories
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That smile us on to tell delightful stories.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what has made the sage or poet write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fair paradise of Natures light?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the calm grandeur of a sober line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the waving of the mountain pine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when a tale is beautifully staid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is moving on luxurious wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair dewy roses brush against our faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oerhead we see the jasmine and sweet briar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charms us at once away from all our troubles:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that we feel uplifted from the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking upon the white clouds wreathd and curld.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So felt he, who first told, how Psyche went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the smooth wind to realms of wonderment;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Psyche felt, and Love, when their full lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First touchd; what amorous and fondling nips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gave each others cheeks; with all their sighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how they kist each others tremulous eyes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver lamp, the ravishment, the wonder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness, loneliness, the fearful thunder;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bow for gratitude before Joves throne.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did he feel, who pulld the boughs aside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we might look into a forest wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch a glimpse of Fawns, and Dryades
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming with softest rustle through the trees;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling us how fair, trembling Syrinx fled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Nymph, poor Pan, how did he weep to find,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the reedy stream; a half heard strain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of sweet desolation balmy pain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What first inspired a bard of old to sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Narcissus pining oer the untainted spring?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some delicious ramble, he had found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little space, with boughs all woven round;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the midst of all, a clearer pool
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than eer reflected in its pleasant cool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the bank a lonely flower he spied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drooping its beauty oer the watery clearness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To woo its own sad image into nearness:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fainter gleamings oer his fancy shot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor was it long ere he had told the tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of young Narcissus, and sad Echos bale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sweetest of all songs, that ever new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming ever to bless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wanderer by moonlight? to him bringing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out the middle air, from flowery nests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the pillowy silkiness that rests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full in the speculation of the stars.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! surely he had burst our mortal bars;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into some wondrous region he had gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To search for thee, divine Endymion!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a Poet, sure a lover too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stood on Latmus top, what time there blew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hymn from Dians temple; while upswelling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incense went to her own starry dwelling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though her face was clear as infants eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though she stood smiling oer the sacrifice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet wept at her so piteous fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wept that such beauty should be desolate:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen of the wide air; thou most lovely queen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As thou exceedest all things in thy shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So every tale, does this sweet tale of thine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O for three words of honey, that I might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where distant ships do seem to show their keels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening weather was so bright, and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That men of health were of unusual cheer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping like Homer at the trumpets call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or young Apollo on the pedestal:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lovely women were as fair and warm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Venus looking sideways in alarm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breezes were ethereal, and pure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crept through half closed lattices to cure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The languid sick; it coold their feverd sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soothed them into slumbers full and deep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon they awoke clear eyed: nor burnt with thirsting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And springing up, they met the wondring sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on their placid foreheads part the hair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young men, and maidens at each other gazd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hands held back, and motionless, amazd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the brightness in each others eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they stood, filld with a sweet surprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until their tongues were loosd in poesy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore no lover did of anguish die:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soft numbers, in that moment spoken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made silken ties, that never may be broken.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia! I cannot tell the greater blisses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That followd thine, and thy dear shepherds kisses:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there a Poet born? but now no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wandring spirit must no further soar.

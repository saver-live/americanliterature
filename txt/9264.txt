<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should I blame her that she filled my days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With misery, or that she would of late
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had they but courage equal to desire?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could have made her peaceful with a mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nobleness made simple as a fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not natural in an age like this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being high and solitary and most stern?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, what could she have done being what she is?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there another Troy for her to burn?

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this I read in history,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of marvel, full of mystery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficult to understand?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it fiction, is it truth?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children in the flower of youth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart in heart, and hand in hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignorant of what helps or harms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without armor, without arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journeying to the Holy Land!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall answer or divine?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never since the world was made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a wonderful crusade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started forth for Palestine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never while the world shall last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it reproduce the past;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never will it see again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an army, such a band,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over mountain, over main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journeying to the Holy Land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a shower of blossoms blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the parent trees were they;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a flock of birds that fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the unfrequented sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding nothing as their own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed they into lands unknown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed to suffer and to die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the simple, child-like trust!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O the faith that could believe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the harnessed, iron-mailed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knights of Christendom had failed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By their prowess, to achieve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They the children, could and must?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little thought the Hermit, preaching
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Wars to knight and baron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the words dropped in his teaching,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His entreaty, his beseeching,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would by children's hands be gleaned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the staff on which he leaned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossom like the rod of Aaron.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a summer wind upheaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innumerable leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bosom of a wood,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as separate leaves, but massed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All together by the blast,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for evil or for good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His resistless breath upheaved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All at once the many-leaved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many-thoughted multitude.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tumult of the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock the boughs with all the nests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradled on their tossing crests;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the fervor of his prayer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubled hearts were everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocked and tossed in human breasts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a century, at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His prophetic voice had ceased;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the air was heated still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his lurid words and will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from fires in far-off woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the autumn of the year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unwonted fever broods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sultry atmosphere.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Cologne the bells were ringing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Cologne the nuns were singing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hymns and canticles divine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud the monks sang in their stalls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thronging streets were loud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voices of the crowd;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the city walls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent flowed the river Rhine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gates, that summer day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad in robes of hodden gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the red cross on the breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azure-eyed and golden-haired,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth the young crusaders fared;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While above the band devoted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consecrated banners floated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluttered many a flag and streamer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cross o'er all the rest!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing lowly, meekly, slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give us, give us back the holy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sepulchre of the Redeemer!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the vast procession pressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youths and maidens. . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! what master hand shall paint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they journeyed on their way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the days grew long and dreary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How their little feet grew weary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How their little hearts grew faint!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever swifter day by day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowed the homeward river; ever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more its whitening current
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke and scattered into spray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the calmly-flowing river
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed into a mountain torrent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushing from its glacier green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down through chasm and black ravine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a phoenix in its nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned the red sun in the West,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking in an ashen cloud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the East, above the crest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sea-like mountain chain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a phoenix from its shroud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the red sun back again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now around them, white with snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed the mountain peaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Headlong from the precipice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down into the dark abyss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged the cataract, white with foam;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it said, or seemed to say:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh return, while yet you may,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foolish children, to your home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the Holy City is!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dauntless leader said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faint not, though your bleeding feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er these slippery paths of sleet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move but painfully and slowly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other feet than yours have bled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other tears than yours been shed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courage! lose not heart or hope;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mountains' southern slope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies Jerusalem the Holy!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a white rose in its pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the wind in summer-tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tossed and loosened from the branch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showers its petals o'er the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the distant mountain's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattering all its snows around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mysterious, muffled sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loosened, fell the avalanche.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices, echoes far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roar of winds and waters blending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mists uprising, clouds impending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled them with a sense of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formless, nameless, never ending.

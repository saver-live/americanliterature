&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened at the porch that day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear the wheel go on, and on;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then it stopped, ran back away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While through the door he brought the sun:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now my spinning is all done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat beside me, with an oath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That love ne'er ended, once begun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled, believing for us both,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the truth for only one:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now my spinning is all done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother cursed me that I heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man's wooing as I spun:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, cruel mother, for that word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have, since, a harder known!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now my spinning is all done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought, O God! my first-born's cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both voices to mine ear would drown:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened in mine agony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the silence made me groan!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now my spinning is all done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bury me 'twixt my mother's grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who cursed me on her death-bed lone)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my dead baby's (God it save!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, not to bless me, would not moan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now my spinning is all done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stone upon my heart and head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no name written on the stone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet neighbours, whisper low instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sinner was a loving one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now her spinning is all done."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the door ajar remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case he should pass by anon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the wheel out very plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That HE, when passing in the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May see the spinning is all done.

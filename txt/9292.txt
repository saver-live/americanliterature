<pre>I dreamed that I stood in a valley, and amid sighs,
For happy lovers passed two by two where I stood;
And I dreamed my lost love came stealthily out of the
wood
With her cloud-pale eyelids falling on dream-dimmed
eyes:
I cried in my dream, O i(women, bid the young men lay)
i(Their heads on your knees, and drown their eyes with your fair,)
i(Or remembering hers they will find no other face fair)
i(Till all the valleys of the world have been withered away.)

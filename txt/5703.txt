<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we meet again!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the meaning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the familiar words, that men repeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At parting in the street.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah yes, till then! but when death intervening
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rends us asunder, with what ceaseless pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wait for the Again!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friends who leave us do not feel the sorrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of parting, as we feel it, who must stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamenting day by day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knowing, when we wake upon the morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not find in its accustomed place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one beloved face.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It were a double grief, if the departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being released from earth, should still retain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of earthly pain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It were a double grief, if the true-hearted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved us here, should on the farther shore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember us no more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believing, in the midst of our afflictions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That death is a beginning, not an end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cry to them, and send
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewells, that better might be called predictions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being fore-shadowings of the future, thrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the vast Unknown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith overleaps the confines of our reason,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if by faith, as in old times was said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women received their dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised up to life, then only for a season
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our partings are, nor shall we wait in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we meet again!

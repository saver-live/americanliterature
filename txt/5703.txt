&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAY 23, 1864

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beautiful it was, that one bright day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long week of rain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all its splendor could not chase away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The omnipresent pain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely town was white with apple-blooms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great elms o'erhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark shadows wove on their aerial looms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot through with golden thread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the meadows, by the gray old manse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historic river flowed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was as one who wanders in a trance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconscious of his road.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of familiar friends seemed strange;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their voices I could hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the words they uttered seemed to change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their meaning to my ear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the one face I looked for was not there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one low voice was mute;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only an unseen presence filled the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And baffled my pursuit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I look back, and meadow, manse, and stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimly my thought defines;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only see--a dream within a dream--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill-top hearsed with pines.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only hear above his place of rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tender undertone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The infinite longings of a troubled breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice so like his own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in seclusion and remote from men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard hand lies cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which at its topmost speed let fall the pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left the tale half told.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! who shall lift that wand of magic power,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lost clew regain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfinished window in Aladdin's tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfinished must remain!

"Why that contented sigh?" asked Bob. "Because our wedding trip is over? Well, anyhow, Bettina, it's after five. Shall we have dinner at the hotel?" </p><p>"Hotel? Why, Bob! with our house and our dishes and our silver just waiting for us? I'm ashamed of you! We'll take the first car for home—a street-car, not a taxi! Our extravagant days are over, and the time has come to show you that Bettina knows how to keep house. You think that you love me now, Bobby, but just wait till you sit down to a real strawberry shortcake made by a real cook in a real home!" </p><p>Half an hour later Bob was unlocking the door of the new brown bungalow. "Isn't it a dear?" cried Bettina proudly. "When we've had time to give it grass and shrubs and flowers and a vegetable garden, no place in town will equal it! And as for porch furniture, how I'd like to get at Mother's attic and transform some of her discarded things!" </p><p>"Just now I'd rather get at some of Mother's cooking!" grinned Bob. </p><p>"Oh, dear, I forgot! I'll have supper ready in ten minutes. Do you remember my emergency shelf? Why, Bob—Bob, they must have known we were coming! Here's ice—and milk—and cream—and butter—and bread—and rolls, and even a grape fruit! They knew, and didn't meet the train because they thought we would prefer to have our first meal alone! Wasn't that dear of them? And this will save you a trip to the corner grocery!" </p><p>Bettina fastened a trim percale bungalow apron over her traveling suit, and swiftly and surely assembled the little meal. </p><p>"I like that apron," said Bob. "It reminds me of the rainy day when we fixed the emergency shelf. That was fun." </p><p>"Yes, and work too," said Bettina, "but I'm glad we did it. Do you remember how much I saved by getting things in dozen and half dozen lots? And Mother showed me how much better it was to buy the larger sizes in bottled things, because in buying the smaller bottles you spend most of your money for the glass. Now that you have to pay my bills, Bob, you'll be glad that I know those things!" </p><p>"I think you know a great deal," said Bob admiringly. "Lots of girls can cook, but mighty few know how to be economical at the same time! It's great to be your——" </p><p>"Dinner is served," Bettina interrupted. "It's a 'pick-up meal,' but I'm hungry, aren't you? And after this, sir, no more canned things!" </p><p>And Bob sat down to:</p><p> </p><p>BETTINA'S RECIPES </p><p>(All measurements are level) </p><p>Creamed Tuna on Toast Strips (Two portions) </p><p>1 T-butter </p><p>1 T-flour </p><p>¼ t-salt </p><p>½ slice pimento </p><p>1 C-milk </p><p>3 slices of bread </p><p>½ C-tuna </p><p> </p><p>Melt the butter, add the flour, salt and pimento. Mix well. Gradually pour in the milk. Allow the mixture to boil one minute. Stir constantly. Add the fish, cook one minute and pour over toasted strips of bread. </p><p> </p><p>Hot Chocolate (Three cups) </p><p>1 square of chocolate </p><p>3 T-sugar </p><p>2/3 C-water </p><p>2 C-milk </p><p>¼ t-vanilla </p><p>3 marshmallows </p><p> </p><p>Cook chocolate, sugar and water until a thin custard is formed. Add milk gradually and bring to a boil. Whip with an egg beater, as this breaks up the albumin found in chocolate, and prevents the coating from forming over the top. Add vanilla and marshmallows. Allow to stand a moment and pour into the cups. </p><p> </p><p>Strawberry Preserves (Six one-half pt. glasses) </p><p>4 lbs. berries </p><p>3 lbs. sugar </p><p>3 C-water </p><p> </p><p>Pick over, wash and hull the berries. Make a syrup by boiling the sugar and water fifteen minutes. Fill sterilized jars with the berries. Cover with syrup and let stand fifteen minutes to settle. Add more berries. Adjust rubbers and covers. Place on a folded cloth in a kettle of cold water. Heat water to boiling point and cook slowly one hour. Screw on covers securely. </p><p> </p><p>On Bettina's Emergency Shelf </p><p>6 cans pimentos (small size) </p><p>6 cans tuna (small size) </p><p>6 cans salmon (small size) </p><p>6 jars dried beef [modern day packaged beef jerky] </p><p>12 cans corn </p><p>12 cans peas </p><p>6 cans string beans </p><p>6 cans lima beans </p><p>6 cans devilled ham (small size) [Spam?] </p><p>6 cans tomatoes </p><p>6 pt. jars pickles </p><p>6 pt. jars olives </p><p>6 small cans condensed milk </p><p>6 boxes sweet wafers </p><p>1 pound box salted codfish </p><p>3 pkg. marshmallows </p><p>3 cans mushrooms </p><p>2 pkg. macaroni </p><h2>Chapter II - Bettina's First Real Dinner</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well, isn't it great to be alive!" exclaimed Bob, as he looked across the rose-decked table at the flushed but happy Bettina. "And a beefsteak dinner, too!" "Steak is expensive, dear, and you'll not get it often, but as this is our first real dinner in our own home, I had to celebrate. I bought enough for two meals, because buying steak for one meal for two people is beyond any modest purse! So you'll meet that steak again tomorrow, but I don't believe that you'll bow in recognition!"</p><p>"So you marketed today, did you?"</p><p>"Indeed I did! I bought a big basket, and went at it like a seasoned housekeeper. I had all the staples to get, you know, and lots of other things. After dinner I'll show you the labelled glass jars on my shelves; it was such fun putting things away! June is a wonderful month for housekeepers. I've planned the meals for days ahead, because I know that's best. Then I'll go to the market several times a week, and if I plan properly I won't have to order by telephone. It seems so extravagant to buy in that way unless you know exactly what you are getting. I like to plan for left-overs, too. For instance, the peas in this salad were left from yesterday's dinner, and the pimento is from that can I opened. Then, too, I cooked tomorrow's potatoes with these to save gas and bother. You'll have them served in a different way, of course. And—— Oh, yes, Bob," Bettina chattered on, "I saw Ruth down town, and have asked all five of my bridesmaids to luncheon day after tomorrow. Won't that be fun? But I promise you that the neglected groom shall have every one of the good things when he comes home at night!"</p><p>"It makes me feel happy, I can tell you, to have a home like this. It's pleasant to be by ourselves, but at the same time I can't help wishing that some of the bachelors I know could see it all and taste your cooking!"</p><p>"Well, Bob, I want you to feel free to have a guest at any time. If my dinners are good enough for you, I'm sure they're good enough for any guest whom you may bring. And it isn't very hard to make a meal for three out of a meal for two. Now, Bobby, if you're ready, will you please get the dessert?"</p><p>"What? Strawberry shortcake? Well, this is living! I tell you what, Bettina, I call this a regular man-size meal!"</p><p>It consisted of:</p><p> </p><p>BETTINA'S RECIPES </p><p>(All measurements are level) </p><p>Pan-Broiled Steak (Two portions) </p><p>1 lb. steak </p><p>1 T-butter </p><p>1 t-salt </p><p>1/8 t-pepper </p><p>2 T-hot water </p><p>1 t-parsley chopped </p><p> </p><p>Wipe the meat carefully with a wet cloth. Remove superfluous fat and any gristle. Cut the edges to prevent them from curling up. When the broiling oven is very hot, place the meat, without any fat, upon a hot flat pan, directly under the blaze. Brown both sides very quickly. Turn often. Reduce heat and continue cooking about seven minutes, or longer if desired. Place on a warm platter; season with salt, pepper and bits of butter. Set in the oven a moment to melt the butter. If salt is added while cooking, the juices will be drawn out. A gravy may be made by adding hot water, butter, salt, pepper and parsley to the pan. Pour the gravy over the steak.</p><p> </p><p>New Potatoes in Cream (Two portions)</p><p>4 new potatoes </p><p>1 qt. water </p><p>1 t-salt </p><p> </p><p>Scrape four medium sized new potatoes. Cook in boiling water (salted) until tender when pierced with a fork. Drain off the water, and shake the kettle over the fire gently, to allow the steam to escape and make the potatoes mealy. Make the following white sauce and pour over the potatoes.</p><p> </p><p>White Sauce for New Potatoes (Two portions) </p><p>2 T-butter </p><p>2 T-flour </p><p>1 C-milk </p><p>½ t-salt </p><p>¼ t-paprika </p><p> </p><p>Melt the butter, add the flour, salt and paprika. Thoroughly mix, slowly add milk, stirring constantly. Allow sauce to cook two minutes. </p><p> </p><p>Strawberry Shortcake (Two portions) </p><p>2 T-lard </p><p>1 T-butter </p><p>2 C-sifted flour </p><p>¾ C-milk </p><p>1/3 t-salt </p><p>4 t-baking powder </p><p>1 qt. strawberries </p><p>2/3 C-sugar </p><p> </p><p>Cut the fat into the flour, salt and baking powder until the consistency of cornmeal. Gradually add the milk, using a knife to mix. Do not handle any more than absolutely necessary. Toss the dough upon a floured board or a piece of clean brown paper. Pat into the desired shape, and place in a pan. Bake in a hot oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Split, spread with butter, and place strawberries, crushed and sweetened, between and on top. Serve with cream.</p><h2>Chapter III - Bettina's First Guest</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>"HELLO! Yes, this is Bettina! Why, Bob, of course! Is he a real woman-hater? No, I've never met any, but I'll just invite Alice, too, and tomorrow you won't be calling him that. Six-thirty? Yes, I'll be ready for you both; I'm so glad you asked him. He'll be our first guest! Good-bye!" Bettina left the telephone with more misgivings than her tone had indicated. She couldn't disappoint Bob, and she liked unexpected company, but the dinner which she had planned was prepared largely from the recipes filed as "left-overs" in her box of indexed cards. </p><p>"Well, Bob will like it, anyhow," she declared confidently, "and if Alice can come, we'll have enough scintillating table-talk to make up for disappointments." </p><p>Alice accepted with delight, promising to wear "a dream of a gown that just came home," and confessing to a sentimental feeling at the thought of dining with such a new bride and groom. </p><p>"Let's see," said Bettina in her spick and span little kitchen, "there is meat enough, but I must hard-boil some eggs to help out these potatoes. 'Potatoes Anna' will be delicious. Goodness, what would my home economics teacher have said if she had heard me say 'hard-boil'? They mustn't really be boiled at all, just 'hard-cooked' in water kept at the boiling point. There will be enough baked green peppers for four, and enough of the pudding, and if I add some very good coffee[18], I don't believe that Bob's Mr. Harrison will feel that women are such nuisances after all! It isn't an elaborate meal, but it's wholesome, and at any rate, our gas bill will be a little smaller because everything goes into the oven." </p><p>When Alice arrived, Bettina was putting the finishing touches on her table. "Alice, you look stunning!" </p><p>"And you look lovely, which is better! And the table is charming! Those red clover blossoms in that brown basket make a perfect center-piece! How did you think of it?" </p><p>"Mother Necessity reminded me, my dear! My next door neighbor has roses, but I covet some for my luncheon tomorrow, and did not like to ask for any today. So I had to use these red clover blooms from our own back yard. They are simple, like the dinner." </p><p>"Don't you envy me, Harrison?" asked Bob at the table. "This is my third day of real home cooking! You were unexpected company, too!" </p><p>The dinner consisted of:</p><p> </p><p>BETTINA'S RECIPES </p><p> </p><p>(All measurements are level) </p><p> </p><p>Boubons (Four portions) </p><p>1 C-cooked meat ground fine (one or more kinds may be used) </p><p>2 T-fresh bread crumbs </p><p>¼ t-pepper </p><p>½ C-milk </p><p>1 T-green pepper or pimento chopped fine </p><p>¼ t-celery salt </p><p>1 egg </p><p>½ t-salt </p><p>1 t-butter (melted) </p><p> </p><p>Beat the egg, add milk, seasonings, melted butter, breadcrumbs and meat. Mix thoroughly. Fill buttered cups three-fourths full of mixture. Place in a pan of boiling water, and[19] bake in a moderate oven fifteen minutes. The mixture is done as soon as it resists pressure in the center. Allow them to remain in the pans a few minutes, then remove carefully upon a serving plate. They may be made in a large mould or individual ones. Serve with the following sauce.</p><p> </p><p>Tomato Sauce (Four portions) </p><p>1 C-tomatoes </p><p>1 slice onion </p><p>4 bay leaves </p><p>4 cloves <p.½ t-sugar <p>

Slowly add the hot water. Cook until thick, stirring constantly. Add flavoring and butter.</p><h2>Chapter IV - Bettina Gives a Luncheon</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>O You darling Bettina! Did you do it all yourself?" Mary exclaimed impulsively, as the girls admired the dainty first course which their hostess set before them. "Everything is pink and white, like the wedding!" "Yes," said Bettina, "and those maline bows on the basket of roses actually attended my wedding. And after this is over, you may see that maline again. I expect to press it out and put it away for other pink luncheons in other Junes! Today, since my guests were to be just my bridesmaids, I thought that a pink luncheon would be the most appropriate kind."</p><p>"Isn't it fine to be in Bettina's own house? I can't realize it!" said Ellen. "And the idea of daring to cook a whole luncheon and serve it in courses all by herself! Why, Bettina, how did you know what to have?"</p><p>"Well," said Bettina, "I went to the market and saw all the inexpensive things that one can buy in June! (They had to be inexpensive! Why, if I were to tell you just what this luncheon cost, you'd laugh. But I want you to like it all before I give that secret away.) And then in planning my menu, I thought of pinky things that went together. That was all, you see."</p><p></p><p>"But didn't it take hours and hours to prepare everything?"</p><p>"Why, no. I thought it all out first, and wrote it down, and did most of it yesterday. I've found that five minutes of planning is worth five hours of unplanned work. I haven't hurried, and as Bob will have this same meal as his dinner tonight, I didn't have to think of him except to plan for more. You see, I estimated each portion as carefully as I could, for it isn't necessary to have a lot of left-over things. Tonight I'll wear this same pink gown at dinner so that Bob will get every bit that he can of my first luncheon except the silly girls who flattered the cook."</p><p>"Bettina, there are so many things I'd like to ask you!" said Ruth, who was a little conscious of the shining ring on her left hand. "Tell me, for instance, how you shaped these cunning timbales. With your hands?"</p><p>"With a conical ice-cream mould. It is so easy that way."</p><p>"And this salad! Fred is so fond of salad, but I don't know a thing about making it."</p><p>"Well, I washed the lettuce thoroughly, and when it was very wet I put it on the ice in a cloth. I poured boiling water over these tomatoes to make the skins peel off easily. And, oh, yes, these cucumbers are crisp because I kept the slices in ice water for awhile before I served them. Good salad is always very cold; the ingredients ought to be chilled before they are mixed."</p><p>"These dear little cakes, Bettina! How could you make them in such cunning shapes?"</p><p>"With a fancy cutter. And I dipped it in warm water each time before I used it, so that it would cut evenly. I'd love to show you girls all that I know about cooking. Do learn it now while you're at home; it will save much labor and even tears! Why, Bob said——"</p><p>"I knew that was coming!" laughed Alice. "Girls, in self-defense, let's keep the conversation strictly on Betty's menu, and away from Betty's husband!"</p><p>And so they discussed:</p><p> </p><p> BETTINA'S RECIPES <br>(All measurements are level) <br>Strawberries au Naturel (Ten portions) <br>2 quarts strawberries <br>1 C-powdered sugar <br>Pick over selected berries, place in a colander and wash, draining carefully. Press powdered sugar into cordial glasses to shape into a small mould. Remove from glasses onto centers of paper doilies placed on fruit plates. Attractively arrange ten berries around each mound. Berries should be kept cool and not hulled. Natural leaves may be used very effectively on the doily.</p><p>Croutons for the Soup (Ten portions) <br>4 slices bread <br>2 T-butter (melted) <br>½ t-salt <br>Cut stale bread in one-third inch cubes. Brown in the oven. Add melted butter and salt. Mix and reheat the croutons.</p><p></p><p>Salmon Timbales (Eight portions) <br>1 C-salmon flaked <br>¼ C-bread crumbs <br>1 slightly beaten egg <br>2/3 C-milk <br>1 T-lemon juice <br>1/8 t-paprika <br>¼ t-salt <br>Mix ingredients in order named. Fill small buttered moulds or cups one-half full. Set in a pan of hot water, and bake twenty minutes in a moderate oven. Serve with following sauce:</p><p>Egg Sauce (Eight portions) <br>3 T-butter <br>3 T-flour <br>1½ C-milk <br>½ t-salt <br>¼ t-pepper <br>1 egg yolk <br>Melt the butter, stir flour in well, and slowly add the milk. Let it boil about two minutes, stirring constantly. Season, add yolk of egg, and mix well. (The oil from the salmon may be substituted for melted butter as far as it will go.)</p><p></p><p>White Cakes (Sixteen cakes) <br>1/3 C-butter <br>1 C-sugar <br>2/3 C-milk <br>2 C-sifted flour <br>3 t-baking powder <br>½ t-lemon extract <br>½ t-vanilla <br>3 egg whites</p><p></p><p></p><p>White Mountain Cream Icing for Cakes <br>1 C-granulated sugar <br>1/8 t-cream tartar <br>¼ C-water <br>1 egg white <br>½ t-vanilla <br>Boil the sugar, water and cream of tartar together without stirring. Remove from fire as soon as the syrup hairs when dropped from a spoon. Pour very slowly onto the stiffly beaten egg white. Beat vigorously with sweeping strokes until cool. If icing gets too hard to spread, add a little warm water and keep beating. Add extract and spread on cakes. Decorate with tiny pink candies.</p><h2>Chapter V - Bob Helps to Get Dinner</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Guess who!" said a voice behind Bettina, as two hands blinded her eyes. "Why, Bob, dear! Good for you! How did you get home so early?"</p><p>"I caught a ride with Dixon in his new car. And I thought you might need me to help get dinner; it's nice to be needed! But here I've been picturing you toiling over a hot stove, and, instead, I find you on the porch with a magazine, as cool as a cucumber!"</p><p>"The day of toiling over a hot stove in summer is over. At least for anyone with sense! But I'm glad you did come home early, and you can help with dinner. Will you make the French dressing for the salad? See, I'll measure it out, and you can stir it this way with a fork until it's well mixed and a little thick."</p><p>"I know a much better way than that. Just watch your Uncle Bob; see? I'll put it in this little Mason jar and shake it. It's a lot easier and—there you are! We'll use what we need tonight, put the jar away in the ice-box, and the next time we can give it another good shaking before we use it."</p><p>"Why, Bob, what an ingenious boy you are! I never would have thought of that!"</p><p>"You married a man with brains, Betty dear! What is there besides the salad?"</p><p>"Halibut steak. It's Friday, you know, and there is such good inexpensive fish on the market. A pound is plenty for[26] us. The potatoes are ready for the white sauce, the beans are in the fireless cooker, and for dessert there is fresh pineapple sliced. The pineapple is all ready. Will you get it, dear? In the ice-box in a covered jar."</p><p>"Why didn't you slice it into the serving dish?"</p><p>"Because it had to be covered tight. Pineapple has a penetrating odor, and milk and butter absorb it in no time."</p><p>"What else shall I do, Madam Bettina?"</p><p>"Well, you may fix the lemon for the fish. No, not sliced; a slice is too hard to handle. Just cut it in halves and then once the other way, in quarters; see? You may also cut up a little of that parsley for the creamed new potatoes. That reminds me that I am going to have parsley growing in a kitchen window box some day. Now you can take the beans out of the cooker, and I'll put butter sauce on them. No, it isn't really a sauce,—just melted butter with salt and pepper. There, Bobby dear! Dinner is served, and you helped! How do you like the coreopsis on the table?"</p><p>"You always manage to have flowers of some kind, don't you, Betty? I'm growing so accustomed to that little habit of yours that I suppose I wouldn't have any appetite if I had to eat on an ordinary undecorated table!"</p><p>"Don't you make fun of me, old fellow! You'd have an appetite no matter when, how or what you had to eat! But things are good tonight, aren't they?"</p><p>Bob had helped to prepare:</p><p> </p><p>BETTINA'S RECIPES <br>(All measurements are level) <br>Halibut Steak (Two portions) <br>2/3 lb. Halibut Steak <br>3 T-flour <br>½ t-salt <br>¼ t-paprika <br>Wash one pound of Halibut steak and wipe dry. Cut in two pieces. Roll in flour, and cook ten minutes in a frying pan[27] in hot fat.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I gird on for fighting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sword upon my thigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think on old ill fortunes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of better men than I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think I, the round world over,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What golden lads are low
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hurts not mine to mourn for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shames I shall not know.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What evil luck soever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me remains in store,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Â‘Tis sure much finer fellows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have fared much worse before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here are things to think on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ought to make me brave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I strap on for fighting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sword that will not save.

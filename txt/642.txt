<p>Gold vessels of fine wines,<br> thousands a gallon,<br> Jade dishes of rare meats,<br> costing more thousands,<br> <br> I lay my chopsticks down,<br> no more can banquet,<br> I draw my sword and stare<br> wildly about me:<br> <br> Ice bars my way to cross<br> the Yellow River,<br> Snows from dark skies to climb<br> the T'ai-hang mountains!<br> <br> At peace I drop a hook<br> into a brooklet,<br> At once I'm in a boat<br> but sailing sunward...<br> <br> (Hard is the journey,<br> Hard is the journey,<br> So many turnings,<br> And now where am I?)<br> <br> So when a breeze breaks waves,<br> bringing fair weather,<br> I set a cloud for sails,<br> cross the blue oceans! <br></p>

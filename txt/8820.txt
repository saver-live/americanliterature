<p>THIS perfect love can find no words to say.<br> What words are left, still sacred for our use,<br> That have not suffered the sad world's abuse,<br> And figure forth a gladness dimmed and gray?<br> Let us be silent still, since words convey<br> But shadowed images, wherein we lose<br> The fulness of love's light; our lips refuse<br> The fluent commonplace of yesterday.<br> <br> Then shall we hear beneath the brooding wing<br> Of silence what abiding voices sleep,<br> The primal notes of nature, that outring<br> Man's little noises, warble he or weep,<br> The song the morning stars together sing,<br> The sound of deep that calleth unto deep.</p>

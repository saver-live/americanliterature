HOW THE WHALE GOT HIS THROAT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cabin port-holes are dark and green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the seas outside;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shipgoes wop (with a wiggle between)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the steward falls into the soup-tureen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trunks begin to slide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nursey lies on the floor in a heap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mummy tells you to let her sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you are nt waked or washed or dressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, then you will know (if you have nt guessed)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youre Fifty North and Forty West!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Whale Got His Throat.

HOW THE CAMEL GOT HIS HUMP

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Camels hump is an ugly lump
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which well you may see at the Zoo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But uglier yet is the hump we get
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From having too little to do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we havent enough to do-oo-oo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get the hump,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cameelious hump,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hump that is black and blue!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We climb out of bed with a frouzly head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a snarly-yarly voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our bath and our boots and our toys;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there ought to be a corner for me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And I know there is one for you)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we get the hump,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cameelious hump,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hump that is black and blue!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cure for this ill is not to sit still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or frowst with a book by the fire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dig till you gently perspire;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you will find that the sun and the wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Djinn of the Garden too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have lifted the hump,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible hump,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hump that is black and blue!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get it as well as you-oo-oo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I havent enough to do-oo-oo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all get hump,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cameelious hump,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiddies and grown-ups too!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Camel Got His Hump.

HOW THE LEOPARD GOT HIS SPOTS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the Most Wise Baviaan, saying in most wise tones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us melt into the landscape just us two by our lones.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have come, in a carriage, calling. But Mummy is there. . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I can go if you take me, Nurse says she dont care.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets go up to the pig-styes and sit on the farmyard rails!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets say things to the bunnies, and watch em skitter their tails!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets, oh, anything, daddy, so long as its you and me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And going truly exploring, and not being in till tea!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heres your boots (Ive brought em), and heres your cap and stick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heres your pipe and tobacco. Oh, come along out of it, quick!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Leopard Got His Spots.

THE ELEPHANT'S CHILD
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep six honest serving-men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(They taught me all I knew);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their names are What and Why and When
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And How and Where and Who.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I send them over land and sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I send them east and west;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after they have worked for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give them all a rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I let them rest from nine till five,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am busy then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they are hungry men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But different folk have different views;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know a person small,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She keeps ten million serving-men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who get no rest at all!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sends em abroad on her own affairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the second she opens her eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One million Hows, two million Wheres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seven million Whys!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elephant's Child.

THE SING-SONG OF OLD MAN KANGAROO

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the mouth-filling song of the race that was run by a Boomer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run in a single burst, only event of its kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started by Big God Nqong from Warrigaborrigarooma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Man Kangaroo first, Yellow-Dog Dingo behind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kangaroo bounded away, his back-legs working like pistons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bounded from morning till dark, twenty-five feet at a bound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow-Dog Dingo lay like a yellow cloud in the distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much too busy to bark.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My! but they covered the ground!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows where they went, or followed the track that they flew in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that Continent hadnt been given a name.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ran thirty degrees, from Torres Straits to the Leeuwin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Look at the Atlas, please), then they ran back as they came.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sposing you could trot from Adelaide to the Pacific,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an afternoons run, half what these gentlemen did,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would feel rather hot, but your legs would develop terrific,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, my importunate son, youd be a Marvellous Kid!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo.

THE BEGINNING OF THE ARMADILLOS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive never sailed the Amazon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive never reached Brazil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Don and Magdalena,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can go there when they will!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, weekly from Southampton,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great steamers, white and gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go rolling down to Rio
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Roll down, roll down to Rio!).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Id like to roll to Rio
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some day before Im old!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive never seen a Jaguar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet an Armadill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O dilloing in his armour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I spose I never will,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless I go to Rio
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These wonders to behold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll down, roll down to Rio,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll really down to Rio!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Id love to roll to Rio
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some day before Im old!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beginning of the Armadilloes.

THE CRAB THAT PLAYED WITH THE SEA

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China-going P. and O.s
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass Pau Ammas playground close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his Pusat Tasek lies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the track of most B.I.s
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N.Y.K.and N.D.L..
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know Pau Ammas home as well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Fisher of the Sea knows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bens, M.M.s, and Rubattinos.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But (and this is rather queer)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.T.L.s can not come here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O. and O. and D.O.A.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must go round another way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orient, Anchor, Bibby, Hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never go that way at all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.C.S. would have a fit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it found itself on it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if Beavers took their cargoes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Penang instead of Lagos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a fat Shaw-Savill bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passengers to Singapore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a White Star were to try a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little trip to Sourabaya,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a B.S.A. went on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past Natal to Cheribon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then great Mr. Lloyds would come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wire and drag them home!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youll know what my riddle means
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When youve eaten mangosteens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crab That Played with the Sea.

THE CAT THAT WALKED BY HIMSELF

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pussy can sit by the fire and sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pussy can climb a tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or play with a silly old cork and string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To muse herself, not me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I like Binkie my dog, because
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows how to behave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Binkies the same as the First Friend was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am the Man in the Cave!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pussy will play man-Friday till
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its time to wet her paw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make her walk on the window-sill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For the footprint Crusoe saw);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she fluffles her tail and mews,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scratches and wont attend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Binkie will play whatever I choose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is my true First Friend!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pussy will rub my knees with her head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretending she loves me hard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the very minute I go to my bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pussy runs out in the yard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there she stays till the morning-light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I know it is only pretend;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Binkie, he snores at my feet all night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is my Firstest Friend!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cat That Walked by Himself.

HOW THE RHINOCEROS GOT HIS SKIN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Uninhabited Island
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is near Cape Gardafui;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But its hot-too hot-off Suez
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the likes of you and me Ever to go in a P. &amp; 0.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To call on the Cake Parsee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Rhinoceros got his Skin.

THE BUTTERFLY THAT STAMPED

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a Queen like Balkis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here to the wide worlds end;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Balkis talked to a butterfly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you would talk to a friend.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a King like Solomon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not since the world began;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Solomon talked to a butterfly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a man would talk to a man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was Queen of Sabæa-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was Asias Lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they both of em talked to butterflies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they took their walks abroad!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Butterfly That Stamped.

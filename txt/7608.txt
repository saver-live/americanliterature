<p> "Come and hire me," I cried, while in the morning I was walking on the stone-paved road.<br> Sword in hand, the King came in his chariot.<br> He held my hand and said, "I will hire you with my power."<br> But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot.<br> In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors.<br> I wandered along the crooked lane.<br> An old man came out with his bag of gold.<br> He pondered and said, "I will hire you with my money."<br> He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away.<br> It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower.<br> The fair maid came out and said, "I will hire you with a smile."<br> Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark.<br> The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly.<br> A child sat playing with shells.<br> He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, "I hire you with nothing."<br> From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.</p>

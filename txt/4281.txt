<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a dove, and the sweet dove died;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have thought it died of grieving:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, what could it grieve for? its feet were tied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a single thread of my own hand's weaving;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet little red feet, why should you die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should you leave me, sweet bird, why?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You lived alone in the forest tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, pretty thing! would you not live with me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kiss'd you oft and gave you white peas;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not live sweetly, as in the green trees?
</pre>

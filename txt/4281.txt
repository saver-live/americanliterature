<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In midmost Ind, beside Hydaspes cool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood, or hover'd, tremulous in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faery city 'neath the potent rule
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Emperor Elfinan; fam'd ev'rywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For love of mortal women, maidens fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose lips were solid, whose soft hands were made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a fit mould and beauty, ripe and rare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tamper his slight wooing, warm yet staid:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lov'd girls smooth as shades, but hated a mere shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a crime forbidden by the law;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the priesthood of his city wept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ruin and dismay they well foresaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If impious prince no bound or limit kept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faery Zendervester overstept;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wept, he sin'd, and still he would sin on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dreamt of sin, and he sin'd while they slept;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain the pulpit thunder'd at the throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caricature was vain, and vain the tart lampoon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seeing, his high court of parliament
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid a remonstrance at his Highness' feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praying his royal senses to content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Themselves with what in faery land was sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Befitting best that shade with shade should meet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat, to calm their fears, he promis'd soon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From mortal tempters all to make retreat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, even on the first of the new moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An immaterial wife to espouse as heaven's boon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime he sent a fluttering embassy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Pigmio, of Imaus sovereign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To half beg, and half demand, respectfully,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of his fair daughter Bellanaine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An audience had, and speeching done, they gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their point, and bring the weeping bride away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom, with but one attendant, safely lain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon their wings, they bore in bright array,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While little harps were touch'd by many a lyric fay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in old pictures tender cherubim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A child's soul thro' the sapphir'd canvas bear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, thro' a real heaven, on they swim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sweet princess on her plumag'd lair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed giving to the winds her lustrous hair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so she journey'd, sleeping or awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save when, for healthful exercise and air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She chose to "promener Ã  l'aile," or take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pigeon's somerset, for sport or change's sake.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Princess, do not whisper me so loud,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth Corallina, nurse and confidant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not you see there, lurking in a cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close at your back, that sly old Crafticant?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hears a whisper plainer than a rant:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry up your tears, and do not look so blue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's Elfinan's great state-spy militant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His running, lying, flying foot-man too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear mistress, let him have no handle against you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Show him a mouse's tail, and he will guess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With metaphysic swiftness, at the mouse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show him a garden, and with speed no less,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll surmise sagely of a dwelling house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plot, in the same minute, how to chouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner out of it; show him a" "Peace!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace! nor contrive thy mistress' ire to rouse!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return'd the Princess, "my tongue shall not cease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till from this hated match I get a free release.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, beauteous mortal!" "Hush!" quoth Coralline,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really you must not talk of him, indeed."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You hush!" reply'd the mistress, with a shinee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of anger in her eyes, enough to breed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stouter hearts than nurse's fear and dread:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas not the glance itself made nursey flinch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of its threat she took the utmost heed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not liking in her heart an hour-long pinch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a sharp needle run into her back an inch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she was silenc'd, and fair Bellanaine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writhing her little body with ennui,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued to lament and to complain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Fate, cross-purposing, should let her be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravish'd away far from her dear countree;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all her feelings should be set at nought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trumping up this match so hastily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lowland blood; and lowland blood she thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poison, as every staunch true-born Imaian ought.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorely she griev'd, and wetted three or four
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Provence rose-leaves with her faery tears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not for this cause; alas! she had more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad reasons for her sorrow, as appears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fam'd memoirs of a thousand years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written by Crafticant, and published
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Parpaglion and Co., (those sly compeers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who rak'd up ev'ry fact against the dead,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Scarab Street, Panthea, at the Jubal's Head.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, after a long hypercritic howl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the vicious manners of the age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes on to expose, with heart and soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What vice in this or that year was the rage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backbiting all the world in every page;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With special strictures on the horrid crime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Section'd and subsection'd with learning sage,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of faeries stooping on their wings sublime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kiss a mortal's lips, when such were in their prime.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn to the copious index, you will find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere in the column, headed letter B,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Bellanaine, if you're not blind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then pray refer to the text, and you will see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An article made up of calumny
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this highland princess, rating her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For giving way, so over fashionably,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this new-fangled vice, which seems a burr
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuck in his moral throat, no coughing e'er could stir.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he says plainly that she lov'd a man!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she around him flutter'd, flirted, toy'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before her marriage with great Elfinan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That after marriage too, she never joy'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In husband's company, but still employ'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wits to 'scape away to Angle-land;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where liv'd the youth, who worried and annoy'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her tender heart, and its warm ardours fann'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such a dreadful blaze, her side would scorch her hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us leave this idle tittle-tattle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To waiting-maids, and bed-room coteries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor till fit time against her fame wage battle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Elfinan is very ill at ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us resume his subject if you please:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it may comfort and console him much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rhyme and syllable his miseries;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Elfinan! whose cruel fate was such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat and curs'd a bride he knew he could not touch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as (according to his promises)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridal embassy had taken wing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vanish'd, bird-like, o'er the suburb trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor, empierc'd with the sharp sting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love, retired, vex'd and murmuring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any drone shut from the fair bee-queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into his cabinet, and there did fling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His limbs upon a sofa, full of spleen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And damn'd his House of Commons, in complete chagrin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll trounce some of the members," cry'd the Prince,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll put a mark against some rebel names,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll make the Opposition-benches wince,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll show them very soon, to all their shames,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 'tis to smother up a Prince's flames;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ministers should join in it, I own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprises me! they too at these high games!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I an Emperor? Do I wear a crown?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial Elfinan, go hang thyself or drown!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll trounce 'em! there's the square-cut chancellor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His son shall never touch that bishopric;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the nephew of old Palfior,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll show him that his speeches made me sick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And give the colonelcy to Phalaric;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiptoe marquis, mortal and gallant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall lodge in shabby taverns upon tick;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the Speaker's second cousin's aunt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sha'n't be maid of honour, by heaven that she sha'n't!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll shirk the Duke of A.; I'll cut his brother;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll give no garter to his eldest son;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't speak to his sister or his mother!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount B. shall live at cut-and-run;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how in the world can I contrive to stun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fellow's voice, which plagues me worse than any,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That stubborn fool, that impudent state-dun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sets down ev'ry sovereign as a zany,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That vulgar commoner, Esquire Biancopany?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monstrous affair! Pshaw! pah! what ugly minx
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they fetch from Imaus for my bride?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! my wearied heart within me sinks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think that I must be so near ally'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a cold dullard fay, ah, woe betide!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, fairest of all human loveliness!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Bertha! what crime can it be to glide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the fragrant plaintings of thy dress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or kiss thine eyes, or count thy locks, tress after tress?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said, one minute's while his eyes remaind'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half lidded, piteous, languid, innocent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in a wink, their splendour they regain'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkling revenge with amorous fury blent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love thwarted in bad temper oft has vent:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose, he stampt his foot, he rang the bell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And order'd some death-warrants to be sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For signature: somewhere the tempest fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many a poor fellow does not live to tell.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, Eban," (this was his page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fay of colour, slave from top to toe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent as a present, while yet under age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Viceroy of Zanguebar, wise, slow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His speech, his only words were "yes" and "no,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But swift of look, and foot, and wing was he,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, Eban, this instant go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Hum the soothsayer, whose name I see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the fresh arrivals in our empery.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring Hum to me! But stay here, take my ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pledge of favour, that he not suspect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any foul play, or awkward murdering,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' I have bowstrung many of his sect;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throw in a hint, that if he should neglect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour, the next shall see him in my grasp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the next after that shall see him neck'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or swallow'd by my hunger-starved asp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mention ('tis as well) the torture of the wasp."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These orders given, the Prince, in half a pet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let o'er the silk his propping elbow slide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught up his little legs, and, in a fret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell on the sofa on his royal side.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave retreated backwards, humble-ey'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a slave-like silence clos'd the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to old Hun thro' street and alley hied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He "knew the city," as we say, of yore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for short cuts and turns, was nobody knew more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the time when wholesale dealers close
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shutters with a moody sense of wealth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But retail dealers, diligent, let loose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas (objected to on score of health),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convey'd in little solder'd pipes by stealth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make it flare in many a brilliant form,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all the powers of darkness it repell'th,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which to the oil-trade doth great scaith and harm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And superseded quite the use of the glow-worm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eban, untempted by the pastry-cooks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Of pastry he got store within the palace,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hasty steps, wrapp'd cloak, and solemn looks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incognito upon his errand sallies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His smelling-bottle ready for the allies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pass'd the Hurdy-gurdies with disdain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vowing he'd have them sent on board the gallies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he made his vow; it 'gan to rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore he call'd a coach, and bade it drive amain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll pull the string," said he, and further said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Polluted Jarvey! Ah, thou filthy hack!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose springs of life are all dry'd up and dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose linsey-woolsey lining hangs all slack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose rug is straw, whose wholeness is a crack;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And evermore thy steps go clatter-clitter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose glass once up can never be got back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who prov'st, with jolting arguments and bitter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That 'tis of modern use to travel in a litter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou inconvenience! thou hungry crop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all corn! thou snail-creeper to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who while thou goest ever seem'st to stop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fiddle-faddle standest while you go;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I' the morning, freighted with a weight of woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto some lazar-house thou journeyest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the evening tak'st a double row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dowdies, for some dance or party drest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the goods meanwhile thou movest east and west.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By thy ungallant bearing and sad mien,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inch appears the utmost thou couldst budge;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet at the slightest nod, or hint, or sign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round to the curb-stone patient dost thou trudge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School'd in a beckon, learned in a nudge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dull-ey'd Argus watching for a fare;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet and plodding, thou dost bear no grudge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whisking Tilburies, or Phaetons rare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curricles, or Mail-coaches, swift beyond compare."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophizing thus, he pull'd the check,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade the Coachman wheel to such a street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, turning much his body, more his neck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louted full low, and hoarsely did him greet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certes, Monsieur were best take to his feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his servant can no further drive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For press of coaches, that to-night here meet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many as bees about a straw-capp'd hive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first for April honey into faint flowers they dive."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eban then paid his fare, and tiptoe went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Hum's hotel; and, as he on did pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With head inclin'd, each dusky lineament
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show'd in the pearl-pav'd street, as in a glass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His purple vest, that ever peeping was
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich from the fluttering crimson of his cloak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His silvery trowsers, and his silken sash
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied in a burnish'd knot, their semblance took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the mirror'd walls, wherever he might look.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smil'd at self, and, smiling, show'd his teeth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing his white teeth, he smil'd the more;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted his eye-brows, spurn'd the path beneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show'd teeth again, and smil'd as heretofore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he knock'd at the magician's door;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, till the porter answer'd, might be seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clear panel more he could adore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His turban wreath'd of gold, and white, and green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mustachios, ear-ring, nose-ring, and his sabre keen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does not your master give a rout to-night?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the dark page. "Oh, no!" return'd the Swiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next door but one to us, upon the right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magazin des Modes now open is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the Emperor's wedding; and, sir, this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My master finds a monstrous horrid bore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he retir'd, an hour ago I wis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his best beard and brimstone, to explore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cast a quiet figure in his second floor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gad! he's oblig'd to stick to business!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For chalk, I hear, stands at a pretty price;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for aqua vitae there's a mess!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dentes sapientiae of mice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our barber tells me too, are on the rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinder's a lighter article, nitre pure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes off like lightning, grains of Paradise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At an enormous figure! stars not sure!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zodiac will not move without a slight douceur!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Venus won't stir a peg without a fee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And master is too partial, entre nous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To" "Hush, hush!" cried Eban, "sure that is he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down stairs, by St. Bartholomew!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As backwards as he can, is't something new?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is't his custom, in the name of fun?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He always comes down backward, with one shoe"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return'd the porter, "off, and one shoe on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, saving shoe for sock or stocking, my man John!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was indeed the great Magician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling, with careful toe, for every stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And retrograding careful as he can,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backwards and downwards from his own two pair:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Salpietro!" exclaim'd Hum, "is the dog there?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's always in my way upon the mat!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He's in the kitchen, or the Lord knows where,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reply'd the Swiss, "the nasty, yelping brat!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't beat him!" return'd Hum, and on the floor came pat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then facing right about, he saw the Page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "Don't tell me what you want, Eban;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor is now in a huge rage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis nine to one he'll give you the rattan!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us away!" Away together ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plain-dress'd sage and spangled blackamoor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor rested till they stood to cool, and fan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathe themselves at th' Emperor's chamber door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Eban thought he heard a soft imperial snore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you guess'd, foretold, or prophesy'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's Majesty was in a raving fit?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He dreams," said Hum, "or I have ever lied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he is tearing you, sir, bit by bit."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He's not asleep, and you have little wit,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reply'd the page; "that little buzzing noise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er your palmistry may make of it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes from a play-thing of the Emperor's choice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a Man-Tiger-Organ, prettiest of his toys."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eban then usher'd in the learned Seer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elfinan's back was turn'd, but, ne'ertheless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both, prostrate on the carpet, ear by ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept silently, and waited in distress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the Emperor's moody bitterness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eban especially, who on the floor 'gan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tremble and quake to death, he feared less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dose of senna-tea or nightmare Gorgon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the Emperor when he play'd on his Man-Tiger-Organ.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXXIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kiss'd nine times the carpet's velvet face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of glossy silk, soft, smooth, and meadow-green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the close eye in deep rich fur might trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver tissue, scantly to be seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As daisies lurk'd in June-grass, buds in green;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden the music ceased, sudden the hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of majesty, by dint of passion keen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubled into a common fist, went grand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knock'd down three cut glasses, and his best ink-stand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XL.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then turning round, he saw those trembling two:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eban," said he, "as slaves should taste the fruits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of diligence, I shall remember you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow, or next day, as time suits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a finger conversation with my mutes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begone! for you, Chaldean! here remain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear not, quake not, and as good wine recruits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conjurer's spirits, what cup will you drain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherry in silver, hock in gold, or glass'd champagne?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Commander of the faithful!" answer'd Hum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In preference to these, I'll merely taste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thimble-full of old Jamaica rum."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A simple boon!" said Elfinan; "thou may'st
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have Nantz, with which my morning-coffee's lac'd."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll have a glass of Nantz, then," said the Seer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Made racy (sure my boldness is misplac'd!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the third part (yet that is drinking dear!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the least drop of crÃ¨me de citron, crystal clear."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I pledge you, Hum! and pledge my dearest love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Bertha!" "Bertha! Bertha!" cry'd the sage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know a many Berthas!" "Mine's above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Berthas!" sighed the Emperor. "I engage,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Hum, "in duty, and in vassalage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mention all the Berthas in the earth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's Bertha Watson, and Miss Bertha Page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fam'd for languid eyes, and that for mirth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's Bertha Blount of York, and Bertha Knox of Perth."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to know" "I do know," answer'd Hum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty's in love with some fine girl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Named Bertha; but her surname will not come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a little conjuring." "'Tis Pearl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis Bertha Pearl! What makes my brain so whirl?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she is softer, fairer than her name!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where does she live?" ask'd Hum. "Her fair locks curl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So brightly, they put all our fays to shame!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live? O! at Canterbury, with her old grand-dame."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! good!" cried Hum, "I've known her from a child!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a changeling of my management;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was born at midnight in an Indian wild;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother's screams with the striped tiger's blent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the torch-bearing slaves a halloo sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the jungles; and her palanquin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rested amid the desert's dreariment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook with her agony, till fair were seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little Bertha's eyes ope on the stars serene."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't say," said the monarch; "that may be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as it happen'd, true or else a bam!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink up your brandy, and sit down by me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel, feel my pulse, how much in love I am;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if your science is not all a sham.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me some means to get the lady here."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upon my honour!" said the son of Cham,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is my dainty changeling, near and dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her story sounds at first a little queer."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Convey her to me, Hum, or by my crown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sceptre, and my cross-surmounted globe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll knock you" "Does your majesty mean down?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, you never could my feelings probe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such a depth!" The Emperor took his robe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wept upon its purple palatine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Hum continued, shamming half a sob,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Canterbury doth your lady shine?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me cool your brandy with a little wine."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat a narrow Flemish glass he took,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That since belong'd to Admiral De Witt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admir'd it with a connoisseuring look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the ripest claret crowned it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, ere the lively bead could burst and flit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turn'd it quickly, nimbly upside down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mouth being held conveniently fit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch the treasure: "Best in all the town!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, smack'd his moist lips, and gave a pleasant frown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! good my Prince, weep not!" And then again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He filled a bumper. "Great Sire, do not weep!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your pulse is shocking, but I'll ease your pain."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fetch me that Ottoman, and prithee keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your voice low," said the Emperor; "and steep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some lady's-fingers nice in Candy wine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prithee, Hum, behind the screen do peep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rose-water vase, magician mine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sponge my forehead, so my love doth make me pine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XLIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, cursed Bellanaine!" "Don't think of her,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoin'd the Mago, "but on Bertha muse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, by my choicest best barometer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not throttled be in marriage noose;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've said it, Sire; you only have to choose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bertha or Bellanaine." So saying, he drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the left pocket of his threadbare hose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sampler hoarded slyly, good as new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding it by his thumb and finger full in view.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, this is Bertha Pearl's neat handy-work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name, see here, Midsummer, ninety-one."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elfinan snatch'd it with a sudden jerk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wept as if he never would have done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honouring with royal tears the poor homespun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon were broider'd tigers with black eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long-tail'd pheasants, and a rising sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of posies, great stags, butterflies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bigger than stags, a moon, with other mysteries.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monarch handled o'er and o'er again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those day-school hieroglyphics with a sigh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat in sadness, but pleas'd in the main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till this oracular couplet met his eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astounded Cupid, I do thee defy!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was too much. He shrunk back in his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew pale as death, and fainted very nigh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pho! nonsense!" exclaim'd Hum, "now don't despair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not mean it really. Cheer up, hearty there!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And listen to my words. You say you won't,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On any terms, marry Miss Bellanaine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes against your conscience good! Well, don't.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say you love a mortal. I would fain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuade your honour's highness to refrain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From peccadilloes. But, Sire, as I say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What good would that do? And, to be more plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would do me a mischief some odd day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut off my ears and limbs, or head too, by my fay!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides, manners forbid that I should pass any
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vile strictures on the conduct of a prince
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who should indulge his genius, if he has any,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not, like a subject, foolish matters mince.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I think on't, perhaps I could convince
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Majesty there is no crime at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In loving pretty little Bertha, since
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's very delicate, not over tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fairy's hand, and in the waist why very small."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ring the repeater, gentle Hum!" "'Tis five,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the gentle Hum; "the nights draw in apace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little birds I hear are all alive;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the dawning touch'd upon your face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I put out the candles, please your Grace?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do put them out, and, without more ado,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me how I may that sweet girl embrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How you can bring her to me." "That's for you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Emperor! to adventure, like a lover true."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I fetch her!" "Yes, an't like your Majesty;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as she would be frighten'd wide awake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To travel such a distance through the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of some soft manoeuvre you must make,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your convenience, and her dear nerves' sake;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice way would be to bring her in a swoon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon, I'll tell what course were best to take;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must away this morning." "Hum! so soon?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, you must be in Kent by twelve o'clock at noon."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this great Caesar started on his feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted his wings, and stood attentive-wise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those wings to Canterbury you must beat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you hold Bertha as a worthy prize.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look in the Almanack Moore never lies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April the twenty- fourth, this coming day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now breathing its new bloom upon the skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will end in St. Mark's Eve; you must away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on that eve alone can you the maid convey."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the magician solemnly 'gan to frown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that his frost-white eyebrows, beetling low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaded his deep green eyes, and wrinkles brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaited upon his furnace-scorched brow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth from his hood that hung his neck below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted a bright casket of pure gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch'd a spring-lock, and there in wool or snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charm'd into ever freezing, lay an old
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And legend-leaved book, mysterious to behold.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take this same book, it will not bite you, Sire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, put it underneath your royal arm;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it's a pretty weight it will not tire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rather on your journey keep you warm:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magic, this the potent charm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall drive Bertha to a fainting fit!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time comes, don't feel the least alarm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lift her from the ground, and swiftly flit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to your palace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What shall I do with that same book?" "Why merely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay it on Bertha's table, close beside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her work-box, and 'twill help your purpose dearly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say no more." "Or good or ill betide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the wide air to Kent this morn I glide!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclaim'd the Emperor. "When I return,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask what you will, I'll give you my new bride!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take some more wine, Hum; O Heavens! I burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be upon the wing! Now, now, that minx I spurn!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave her to me," rejoin'd the magian:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But how shall I account, illustrious fay!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thine imperial absence? Pho! I can
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say you are very sick, and bar the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your so loving courtiers for one day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If either of their two archbishops' graces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should talk of extreme unction, I shall say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not like cold pig with Latin phrases,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which never should be used but in alarming cases."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the window, Hum; I'm ready now!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zooks!" exclaim'd Hum, as up the sash he drew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold, your Majesty, upon the brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of yonder hill, what crowds of people!" "Whew!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster's always after something new,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return'd his Highness, "they are piping hot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see my pigsney Bellanaine. Hum! do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tighten my belt a little, so, so, not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too tight, the book! my wand! so, nothing is forgot."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wounds! how they shout!" said Hum, "and there, see, see!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' ambassador's return'd from Pigmio!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning's very fine, uncommonly!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, past the skirts of yon white cloud they go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinging it with soft crimsons! Now below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sable-pointed heads of firs and pines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dip, move on, and with them moves a glow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the forest side! Now amber lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach the hill top, and now throughout the valley shines."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, Hum, you're getting quite poetical!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those 'nows' you managed in a special style."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If ever you have leisure, Sire, you shall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See scraps of mine will make it worth your while,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tid-bits for Phoebus! yes, you well may smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark! hark! the bells!" "A little further yet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Hum, and let me view this mighty coil."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the great Emperor full graceful set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His elbow for a prop, and snuff'd his mignonnette.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morn is full of holiday; loud bells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rival clamours ring from every spire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cunningly-station'd music dies and swells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In echoing places; when the winds respire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light flags stream out like gauzy tongues of fire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A metropolitan murmur, lifeful, warm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes from the northern suburbs; rich attire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freckles with red and gold the moving swarm;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While here and there clear trumpets blow a keen alarm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the fairy escort was seen clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the old pageant of Aurora's train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above a pearl-built minister, hovering near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First wily Crafticant, the chamberlain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balanc'd upon his grey-grown pinions twain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His slender wand officially reveal'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then black gnomes scattering sixpences like rain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then pages three and three; and next, slave-held,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imaian 'scutcheon bright, one mouse in argent field.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentlemen pensioners next; and after them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A troop of winged Janizaries flew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then slaves, as presents bearing many a gem;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then twelve physicians fluttering two and two;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next a chaplain in a cassock new;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Lords in waiting; then (what head not reels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pleasure?) the fair Princess in full view,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne upon wings, and very pleas'd she feels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have such splendour dance attendance at her heels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there was more magnificence behind:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wav'd her handkerchief. "Ah, very grand!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry'd Elfinan, and clos'd the window-blind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Hum, we must not shilly-shally stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu! adieu! I'm off for Angle-land!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, old Hocus, have you such a thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About you, feel your pockets, I command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want, this instant, an invisible ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, old mummy! now securely I take wing."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elfinan swift vaulted from the floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lighted graceful on the window-sill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under one arm the magic book he bore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other he could wave about at will;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale was his face, he still look'd very ill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bow'd at Bellanaine, and said "Poor Bell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell! farewell! and if for ever! still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever fare thee well!" and then he fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A laughing! snapp'd his fingers! shame it is to tell!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By'r Lady! he is gone!" cries Hum, "and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I own it) have made too free with his wine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Crafticant will smoke me. By-the-bye!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is full of jewels as a mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear valuable creatures, how ye shine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime to-day I must contrive a minute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mercury propitiously incline,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To examine his scutoire, and see what's in i,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For of superfluous diamonds I as well may thin it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Emperor's horrid bad; yes, that's my cue!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some histories say that this was Hum's last speech;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, being fuddled, he went reeling through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor, and scarce upright could reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stair-head; that being glutted as a leech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And us'd, as we ourselves have just now said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To manage stairs reversely, like a peach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too ripe, he fell, being puzzled in his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With liquor and the staircase: verdict found stone dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This as a falsehood Crafticanto treats;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as his style is of strange elegance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle and tender, full of soft conceits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Much like our Boswell's,) we will take a glance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his sweet prose, and, if we can, make dance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His woven periods into careless rhyme;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, little faery Pegasus! rear prance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trot round the quarto ordinary time!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March, little Pegasus, with pawing hoof sublime!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let us see, tenth book and chapter nine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Crafticant pursues his diary:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Twas twelve o'clock at night, the weather fine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latitude thirty-six; our scouts descry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flight of starlings making rapidly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards Thibet. Mem.: birds fly in the night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From twelve to half-past wings not fit to fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a thick fog the Princess sulky quite;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call'd for an extra shawl, and gave her nurse a bite.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five minutes before one brought down a moth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my new double-barrel stew'd the thighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a very tolerable broth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess turn'd dainty, to our great surprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alter'd her mind, and thought it very nice;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her pleasant, try'd her with a pun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She frown'd; a monstrous owl across us flies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this time, a sad old figure of fun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad omen this new match can't be a happy one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From two to half-past, dusky way we made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the plains of Gobi, desert, bleak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beheld afar off, in the hooded shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of darkness, a great mountain (strange to speak),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spitting, from forth its sulphur-baken peak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fan-shap'd burst of blood-red, arrowy fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turban'd with smoke, which still away did reek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solid and black from that eternal pyre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the laden winds that scantly could respire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just upon three o'clock a falling star
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created an alarm among our troop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill'd a man-cook, a page, and broke a jar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tureen, and three dishes, at one swoop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then passing by the princess, singed her hoop:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not conceive what Coralline was at,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clapp'd her hands three times and cry'd out 'Whoop!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some strange Imaian custom. A large bat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came sudden 'fore my face, and brush'd against my hat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five minutes thirteen seconds after three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in the west a mighty fire broke out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conjectur'd, on the instant, it might be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Balk 'twas Balk beyond all doubt:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A griffin, wheeling here and there about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept reconnoitring us doubled our guard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted our torches, and kept up a shout,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he sheer'd off the Princess very scar'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many on their marrow-bones for death prepar'd.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At half-past three arose the cheerful moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bivouack'd for four minutes on a cloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where from the earth we heard a lively tune
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tambourines and pipes, serene and loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on a flowery lawn a brilliant crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cinque-parted danc'd, some half asleep reposed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the green-fan'd cedars, some did shroud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silken tents, and 'mid light fragrance dozed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on the opera turf their soothed eyelids closed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dropp'd my gold watch, and kill'd a kettledrum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went for apoplexy foolish folks!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left it to pay the piper a good sum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I've got a conscience, maugre people's jokes,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To scrape a little favour; 'gan to coax
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Highness' pug-dog got a sharp rebuff
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wish'd a game at whist made three revokes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn'd from myself, her partner, in a huff;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His majesty will know her temper time enough.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXIX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She cry'd for chess I play'd a game with her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Castled her king with such a vixen look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bodes ill to his Majesty (refer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the second chapter of my fortieth book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see what hoity-toity airs she took).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At half-past four the morn essay'd to beam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saluted, as we pass'd, an early rook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess fell asleep, and, in her dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk'd of one Master Hubert, deep in her esteem.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXX.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About this time, making delightful way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shed a quill-feather from my larboard wing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wish'd, trusted, hop'd 'twas no sign of decay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank heaven, I'm hearty yet! 'twas no such thing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At five the golden light began to spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fiery shudder through the bloomed east;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At six we heard Panthea's churches ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city wall his unhiv'd swarms had cast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch our grand approach, and hail us as we pass'd.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXXI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As flowers turn their faces to the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on our flight with hungry eyes they gaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as we shap'd our course, this, that way run,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mad-cap pleasure, or hand-clasp'd amaze;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet in the air a mild-ton'd music plays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And progresses through its own labyrinth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buds gather'd from the green spring's middle-days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They scatter'd, daisy, primrose, hyacinth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or round white columns wreath'd from capital to plinth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXXII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Onward we floated o'er the panting streets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seem'd throughout with upheld faces paved;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look where we will, our bird's-eye vision meets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legions of holiday; bright standards waved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fluttering ensigns emulously craved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our minute's glance; a busy thunderous roar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From square to square, among the buildings raved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the sea, at flow, gluts up once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The craggy hollowness of a wild reefed shore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXXIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And 'Bellanaine for ever!' shouted they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While that fair Princess, from her winged chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow'd low with high demeanour, and, to pay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their new-blown loyalty with guerdon fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still emptied at meet distance, here and there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plenty horn of jewels. And here I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who wish to give the devil her due) declare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against that ugly piece of calumny,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which calls them Highland pebble-stones not worth a fly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXXIV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still 'Bellanaine!' they shouted, while we glide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Slant to a light Ionic portico,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city's delicacy, and the pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our Imperial Basilic; a row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lords and ladies, on each hand, make show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submissive of knee-bent obeisance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All down the steps; and, as we enter'd, lo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strangest sight the most unlook'd for chance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things turn'd topsy-turvy in a devil's dance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXXV.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Stead of his anxious Majesty and court
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the open doors, with wide saluting eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CongÃ¨es and scrape-graces of every sort,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the smooth routine of gallantries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was seen, to our immoderate surprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A motley crowd thick gather'd in the hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lords, scullions, deputy-scullions, with wild cries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stunning the vestibule from wall to wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Chief Justice on his knees and hands doth crawl.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXXVI.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Counts of the palace, and the state purveyor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of moth's-down, to make soft the royal beds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Common Council and my fool Lord Mayor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marching a-row, each other slipshod treads;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powder'd bag-wigs and ruffy-tuffy heads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cinder wenches meet and soil each other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toe crush'd with heel ill-natur'd fighting breeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frill-rumpling elbows brew up many a bother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fists in the short ribs keep up the yell and pother.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXXVII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Poet, mounted on the Court-Clown's back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode to the Princess swift with spurring heels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close into her face, with rhyming clack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Began a Prothalamion; she reels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She falls, she faints! while laughter peels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over her woman's weakness. 'Where!' cry'd I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where is his Majesty?' No person feels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclin'd to answer; wherefore instantly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plung'd into the crowd to find him or die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LXXXVIII.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jostling my way I gain'd the stairs, and ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the first landing, where, incredible!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met, far gone in liquor, that old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That vile impostor Hum."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far so well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we have prov'd the Mago never fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down stairs on Crafticanto's evidence;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore duly shall proceed to tell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plain in our own original mood and tense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequel of this day, though labour 'tis immense!

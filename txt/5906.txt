<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparelled in magnificent attire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With retinue of many a knight and squire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On St. John's eve, at vespers, proudly sat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard the priests chant the Magnificat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he listened, o'er and o'er again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeated, like a burden or refrain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught the words, "Deposuit potentes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;De sede, et exaltavit humiles";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slowly lifting up his kingly head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He to a learned clerk beside him said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What mean these words?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk made answer meet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has put down the mighty from their seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has exalted them of low degree."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is well that such seditious words are sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only by priests and in the Latin tongue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unto priests and people be it known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no power can push me from my throne!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaning back, he yawned and fell asleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lulled by the chant monotonous and deep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he awoke, it was already night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church was empty, and there was no light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted a little space before some saint.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started from his seat and gazed around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But saw no living thing and heard no sound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He groped towards the door, but it was locked;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And uttered awful threatenings and complaints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And imprecations upon men and saints.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sounds re-echoed from the roof and walls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if dead priests were laughing in their stalls.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length the sexton, hearing from without
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumult of the knocking and the shout,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinking thieves were in the house of prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came with his lantern, asking, "Who is there?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half choked with rage, King Robert fiercely said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open: 'tis I, the King!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou afraid?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frightened sexton, muttering, with a curse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is some drunken vagabond, or worse!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned the great key and flung the portal wide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man rushed by him at a single stride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haggard, half naked, without hat or cloak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But leaped into the blackness of the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vanished like a spectre from his sight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despoiled of his magnificent attire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bareheaded, breathless, and besprent with mire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sense of wrong and outrage desperate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strode on and thundered at the palace gate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed through the courtyard, thrusting in his rage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To right and left each seneschal and page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurried up the broad and sounding stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white face ghastly in the torches' glare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hall to hall he passed with breathless speed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices and cries he heard, but did not heed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last he reached the banquet-room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blazing with light and breathing with perfume.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There on the dais sat another king,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing his robes, his crown, his signet-ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Robert's self in features, form, and height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all transfigured with angelic light!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an Angel; and his presence there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a divine effulgence filled the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exaltation, piercing the disguise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though none the hidden Angel recognize.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment speechless, motionless, amazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throneless monarch on the Angel gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who met his look of anger and surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the divine compassion of his eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said, "Who art thou? and why com'st thou here?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which King Robert answered, with a sneer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the King, and come to claim my own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an impostor, who usurps my throne!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suddenly, at these audacious words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel answered, with unruffled brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, not the King, but the King's Jester, thou
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth shall wear the bells and scalloped cape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for thy counsellor shalt lead an ape;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt obey my servants when they call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wait upon my henchmen in the hall!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deaf to King Robert's threats and cries and prayers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They thrust him from the hall and down the stairs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of tittering pages ran before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they opened wide the folding door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the vaulted chamber roar and ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mock plaudits of "Long live the King!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next morning, waking with the day's first beam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said within himself, "It was a dream!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the straw rustled as he turned his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were the cap and bells beside his bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around him rose the bare, discolored walls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the corner, a revolting shape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no dream; the world he loved so much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had turned to dust and ashes at his touch!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days came and went; and now returned again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Sicily the old Saturnian reign;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Angel's governance benign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy island danced with corn and wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deep within the mountain's burning breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enceladus, the giant, was at rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sullen and silent and disconsolate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed in the motley garb that Jesters wear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With look bewildered and a vacant stare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only friend the ape, his only food
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What others left,--he still was unsubdued.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the Angel met him on his way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half in earnest, half in jest, would say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The velvet scabbard held a sword of steel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art thou the King?" the passion of his woe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst from him in resistless overflow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lifting high his forehead, he would fling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haughty answer back, "I am, I am the King!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost three years were ended; when there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambassadors of great repute and name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto King Robert, saying that Pope Urbane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By letter summoned them forthwith to come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Holy Thursday to his city of Rome.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel with great joy received his guests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave them presents of embroidered vests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And velvet mantles with rich ermine lined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rings and jewels of the rarest kind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he departed with them o'er the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the lovely land of Italy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose loveliness was more resplendent made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the mere passing of that cavalcade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of jewelled bridle and of golden spur.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! among the menials, in mock state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cloak of fox-tails flapping in the wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solemn ape demurely perched behind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Robert rode, making huge merriment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the country towns through which they went.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope received them with great pomp and blare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bannered trumpets, on Saint Peter's square,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving his benediction and embrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fervent, and full of apostolic grace.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While with congratulations and with prayers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entertained the Angel unawares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert, the Jester, bursting through the crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into their presence rushed, and cried aloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the King!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, and behold in me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert, your brother, King of Sicily!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man, who wears my semblance to your eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is an impostor in a king's disguise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you not know me? does no voice within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer my cry, and say we are akin?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope in silence, but with troubled mien,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed at the Angel's countenance serene;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor, laughing, said, "It is strange sport
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep a mad man for thy Fool at court!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the poor, baffled Jester in disgrace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hustled back among the populace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In solemn state the Holy Week went by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Easter Sunday gleamed upon the sky;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of the Angel, with its light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the sun rose, made the city bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with new fervor filled the hearts of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who felt that Christ indeed had risen again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Jester, on his bed of straw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt within a power unfelt before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, kneeling humbly on his chamber floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the rushing garments of the Lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the visit ending, and once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valmond returning to the Danube's shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward the Angel journeyed, and again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land was made resplendent with his train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashing along the towns of Italy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto Salerno, and from thence by sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when once more within Palermo's wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, seated on the throne in his great hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the Angelus from convent towers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the better world conversed with ours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beckoned to King Robert to draw nigher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a gesture bade the rest retire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they were alone, the Angel said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art thou the King?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, bowing down his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Robert crossed both hands upon his breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meekly answered him: "Thou knowest best!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sins as scarlet are; let me go hence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in some cloister's school of penitence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across those stones, that pave the way to heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk barefoot, till my guilty soul be shriven!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel smiled, and from his radiant face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A holy light illumined all the place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the open window, loud and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard the monks chant in the chapel near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the stir and tumult of the street:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has put down the mighty from their seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has exalted them of low degree!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the chant a second melody
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose like the throbbing of a single string:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am an Angel, and thou art the King!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Robert, who was standing near the throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all apparelled as in days of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ermined mantle and with cloth of gold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when his courtiers came, they found him there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneeling upon the floor, absorbed in, silent prayer.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the blue-eyed Norseman told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Saga of the days of old.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is," said he, "a wondrous book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Legends in the old Norse tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the dead kings of Norroway,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legends that once were told or sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many a smoky fireside nook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Iceland, in the ancient day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By wandering Saga-man or Scald;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heimskringla is the volume called;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he who looks may find therein
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story that I now begin."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in each pause the story made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his violin he played,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an appropriate interlude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fragments of old Norwegian tunes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bound in one the separate runes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held the mind in perfect mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entwining and encircling all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange and antiquated rhymes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with melodies of olden times;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As over some half-ruined wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disjointed and about to fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh woodbines climb and interlace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep the loosened stones in place.

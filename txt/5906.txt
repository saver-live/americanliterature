<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMMA AND EGINHARD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Alcuin taught the sons of Charlemagne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the free schools of Aix, how kings should reign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with them taught the children of the poor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How subjects should be patient and endure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the lips of some, as best befit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With honey from the hives of Holy Writ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others intoxicated with the wine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ancient history, sweet but less divine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some with the wholesome fruits of grammar fed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others with mysteries of the stars o'er-head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hang suspended in the vaulted sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like lamps in some fair palace vast and high.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sooth, it was a pleasant sight to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Saxon monk, with hood and rosary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With inkhorn at his belt, and pen and book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mingled lore and reverence in his look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hear the cloister and the court repeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measured footfalls of his sandaled feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or watch him with the pupils of his school,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle of speech, but absolute of rule.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them, always earliest in his place.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Eginhard, a youth of Frankish race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose face was bright with flashes that forerun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendors of a yet unrisen sun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him all things were possible, and seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not what he had accomplished, but had dreamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what were tasks to others were his play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastime of an idle holiday.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smaragdo, Abbot of St. Michael's, said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a shrug and shaking of the head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely some demon must possess the lad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who showed more wit than ever schoolboy had,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learned his Trivium thus without the rod;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Alcuin said it was the grace of God.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he grew up, in Logic point-device,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect in Grammar, and in Rhetoric nice;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science of Numbers, Geometric art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lore of Stars, and Music knew by heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Minnesinger, long before the times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who sang their love in Suabian rhymes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor, when he heard this good report
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Eginhard much buzzed about the court,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said to himself, "This stripling seems to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purposely sent into the world for me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall become my scribe, and shall be schooled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the arts whereby the world is ruled."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did the gentle Eginhard attain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To honor in the court of Charlemagne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Became the sovereign's favorite, his right hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that his fame was great in all the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all men loved him for his modest grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And comeliness of figure and of face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inmate of the palace, yet recluse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of books, yet sacred from abuse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the armed knights with spur on heel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tramp of horses and the clang of steel;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the Emperor promised he was schooled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the arts by which the world is ruled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the one art supreme, whose law is fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor never dreamed of till too late.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home from her convent to the palace came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely Princess Emma, whose sweet name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered by seneschal or sung by bard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had often touched the soul of Eginhard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw her from his window, as in state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came, by knights attended through the gate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw her at the banquet of that day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh as the morn, and beautiful as May;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw her in the garden, as she strayed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the flowers of summer with her maid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said to him, "O Eginhard, disclose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning and the mystery of the rose";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trembling he made answer: "In good sooth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mystery is love, its meaning youth!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I tell the signals and the signs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By which one heart another heart divines?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I tell the many thousand ways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By which it keeps the secret it betrays?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O mystery of love!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O strange romance!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the Peers and Paladins of France,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining in steel, and prancing on gay steeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble by birth, yet nobler by great deeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess Emma had no words nor looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this clerk, this man of thought and books.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer passed, the autumn came; the stalks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lilies blackened in the garden walks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves fell, russet-golden and blood-red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love-letters thought the poet fancy-led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Jove descending in a shower of gold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the lap of Danae of old;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For poets cherish many a strange conceit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love transmutes all nature by its heat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more the garden lessons, nor the dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurried meetings in the twilight park;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the studious lamp, and the delights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of firesides in the silent winter nights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watching from his window hour by hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that burned in Princess Emma's tower.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length one night, while musing by the fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ercome at last by his insane desire,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what will reckless love not do and dare?--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crossed the court, and climbed the winding stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some feigned message in the Emperor's name;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he to the lady's presence came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knelt down at her feet, until she laid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hand upon him, like a naked blade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispered in his ear: "Arise, Sir Knight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my heart's level, O my heart's delight."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there he lingered till the crowing cock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alectryon of the farmyard and the flock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his aubade with lusty voice and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the sleeping world that dawn was near.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they parted; but at parting, lo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the palace courtyard white with snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, placid as a nun, the moon on high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing from cloudy cloisters of the sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas!" he said, "how hide the fatal line
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of footprints leading from thy door to mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none returning!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, he little knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What woman's wit, when put to proof, can do!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night the Emperor, sleepless with the cares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And troubles that attend on state affairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had risen before the dawn, and musing gazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the silent night, as one amazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the calm that reigned o'er all supreme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his own reign was but a troubled dream.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon lit up the gables capped with snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the white roofs, and half the court below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he beheld a form, that seemed to cower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a burden, come from Emma's tower,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman, who upon her shoulders bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clerk Eginhard to his own private door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then returned in haste, but still essayed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tread the footprints she herself had made;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as she passed across the lighted space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor saw his daughter Emma's face!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started not; he did not speak or moan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seemed as one who hath been turned to stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood there like a statue, nor awoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of his trance of pain, till morning broke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the stars faded, and the moon went down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er the towers and steeples of the town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the gray daylight; then the sun, who took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire of the world with sovereign look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffusing with a soft and golden glow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dead landscape in its shroud of snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching with flame the tapering chapel spires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows and roofs, and smoke of household fires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kindling park and palace as he came;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stork's nest on the chimney seemed in flame.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus he stood till Eginhard appeared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demure and modest with his comely beard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowing flaxen tresses, come to ask,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was his wont, the day's appointed task.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor looked upon him with a smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gently said: "My son, wait yet awhile;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hour my council meets upon some great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very urgent business of the state.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come back within the hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thy return
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work appointed for thee shalt thou learn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dismissed this gallant Troubadour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He summoned straight his council, and secure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And steadfast in his purpose, from the throne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the adventure of the night made known;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then asked for sentence; and with eager breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some answered banishment, and others death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake the king: "Your sentence is not mine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is the gift of God, and is divine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor from these palace walls shall one depart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who carries such a secret in his heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My better judgment points another way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Alcuin, I remember how one day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my Pepino asked you, 'What are men?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wrote upon his tablets with your pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Guests of the grave and travellers that pass!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being true of all men, we, alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being all fashioned of the selfsame dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be merciful as well as just;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passing traveller, who hath stolen away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brightest jewel of my crown to-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall of himself the precious gem restore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By giving it, I make it mine once more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over those fatal footprints I will throw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ermine mantle like another snow."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Eginhard was summoned to the hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And entered, and in presence of them all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor said: "My son, for thou to me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast been a son, and evermore shalt be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long hast thou served thy sovereign, and thy zeal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleads to me with importunate appeal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have been forgetful to requite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy service and affection as was right.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the hour is come, when I, thy Lord,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will crown thy love with such supreme reward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gift so precious kings have striven in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win it from the hands of Charlemagne."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sprang the portals of the chamber wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Princess Emma entered, in the pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of birth and beauty, that in part o'er-came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conscious terror and the blush of shame.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good Emperor rose up from his throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taking her white hand within his own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placed it in Eginhard's, and said: "My son
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the gift thy constant zeal hath won;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I repay the royal debt I owe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cover up the footprints in the snow."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ran the Student's pleasant rhyme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Eginhard and love and youth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some doubted its historic truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while they doubted, ne'ertheless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw in it gleams of truthfulness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thanked the Monk of Lauresheim.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This they discussed in various mood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the silence that ensued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heard a sharp and sudden sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of a bowstring snapped in air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Musician with a bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang up in terror from his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for a moment listening stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then strode across the room, and found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dear, his darling violin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still lying safe asleep within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its little cradle, like a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gives a sudden cry of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wakes to fall asleep again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he looked at it and smiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the uncertain light beguiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despair! two strings were broken in twain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all lamented and made moan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a sympathetic word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the loss had been their own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeming the tones they might have heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter than they had heard before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the Landlord at the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missing man, the portly Squire!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had not entered, but he stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both arms full of seasoned wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed the much-devouring fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like a lion in a cage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lashed its long tail and roared with rage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missing man!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, yes, they said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing, but whither had he fled?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where had he hidden himself away?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No farther than the barn or shed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had not hidden himself, nor fled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should he pass the rainy day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in his barn with hens and hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or mending harness, cart, or sled?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, having come, he needs must stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell his tale as well as they.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord answered only: "These
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are logs from the dead apple-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the old orchard planted here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the first Howe of Sudbury.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor oak nor maple has so clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flame, or burns so quietly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or leaves an ash so clean and white";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking by this to put aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impending tale that terrified;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When suddenly, to his delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian interposed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying that when the door was closed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they had stopped that draft of cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpleasant night air, he proposed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell a tale world-wide apart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that the Student had just told;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World-wide apart, and yet akin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As showing that the human heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beats on forever as of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well beneath the snow-white fold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Quaker kerchief, as within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sendal or silk or cloth of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And without preface would begin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the clamorous clock struck eight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberate, with sonorous chime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow measuring out the march of time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some grave Consul of old Rome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jupiter's temple driving home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nails that marked the year and date.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus interrupted in his rhyme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian needs must wait;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But quoted Horace, where he sings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dire Necessity of things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drives into the roofs sublime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of new-built houses of the great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adamantine nails of Fate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ceased the little carillon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To herald from its wooden tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important transit of the hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian hastened on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content to be all owed at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sing his Idyl of the Past.

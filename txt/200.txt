<p>...And no-one came to meet me<br> Carrying a lantern.<br> The house quiet: my entry<br> By moonlight uncertain.<br> <br> Under the green lamp,<br> His smile was lifeless,<br> Whispering: 'Cinderella,<br> How strange your voice...'<br> <br> Flames of the fire dying:<br> Wearily, cricket chirping.<br> Ah! Someone's taken my<br> White shoe into their keeping.<br> <br> Given me three carnations<br> Without raising their eyes.<br> O, dear tokens,<br> Where can you hide?<br> <br> My heart's bitter too<br> Knowing soon, soon,<br> My little white shoe<br> Will be tried by everyone.<br></p>

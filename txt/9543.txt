<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have cried in our despair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That men desert,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some trivial affair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or noisy, insolent, sport,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty that we have won
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From bitterest hours;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we, had we walked within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those topless towers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Helen walked with her boy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had given but as the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the men and women of Troy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word and a jest.

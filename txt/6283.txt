<h2>Introduction To The Edition Of 1892</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1892.</p><p> BY ARTHUR STEDMAN.</p><p> OF the trinity of American authors whose births made the year1819 a notable one in our literary history,--Lowell, Whitman, andMelville,--it is interesting to observe that the two latter wereboth descended, on the fathers' and mothers' sides respectively,from have families of British New England and Dutch New Yorkextraction. Whitman and Van Velsor, Melville and Gansevoort,were the several combinations which produced these men; and it iseasy to trace in the life and character of each author thequalities derived from his joint ancestry. Here, however, theresemblance ceases, for Whitman's forebears, while worthy countrypeople of good descent, were not prominent in public or privatelife. Melville, on the other hand, was of distinctly patricianbirth, his paternal and maternal grandfathers having been leadingcharacters in the Revolutionary War; their descendants stillmaintaining a dignified social position.</p><p> Allan Melville, great-grandfather of Herman Melville, removedfrom Scotland to America in 1748, and established himself as amerchant in Boston. His son, Major Thomas Melville, was a leaderin the famous 'Boston Tea Party' of 1773 and afterwards became anofficer in the Continental Army. He is reported to have been aConservative in all matters except his opposition to unjusttaxation, and he wore the old-fashioned cocked hat andknee-breeches until his death, in 1832, thus becoming theoriginal of Doctor Holmes's poem,'The Last Leaf'. MajorMelville's son Allan, the father of Herman, was an importingmerchant,--first in Boston, and later in New York. He was a manof much culture, and was an extensive traveller for his time. Hemarried Maria Gansevoort, daughter of General Peter Gansevoort,best known as 'the hero of Fort Stanwix.' This fort was situatedon the present site of Rome, N.Y.; and there Gansevoort, with asmall body of men, held in check reinforcements on their way tojoin Burgoyne, until the disastrous ending of the latter'scampaign of 1777 was insured. The Gansevoorts, it should be said,were at that time and subsequently residents of Albany, N.Y.</p><p> Herman Melville was born in New York on August 1, 1819, andreceived his early education in that city. There he imbibed hisfirst love of adventure, listening, as he says in 'Redburn,'while his father 'of winter evenings, by the well-rememberedsea-coal fire in old Greenwich Street, used to tell my brotherand me of the monstrous waves at sea, mountain high, of the mastsbending like twigs, and all about Havre and Liverpool.' Thedeath of his father in reduced circumstances necessitated theremoval of his mother and the family of eight brothers andsisters to the village of Lansingburg, on the Hudson River. There Herman remained until 1835, when he attended the AlbanyClassical School for some months. Dr. Charles E. West, thewell-known Brooklyn educator, was then in charge of the school,and remembers the lad's deftness in English composition, and hisstruggles with mathematics.</p><p> The following year was passed at Pittsfield, Mass., where heengaged in work on his uncle's farm, long known as the 'VanSchaack place.' This uncle was Thomas Melville, president of theBerkshire Agricultural Society, and a successful gentlemanfarmer.</p><p> Herman's roving disposition, and a desire to support himselfindependently of family assistance, soon led him to ship as cabinboy in a New York vessel bound for Liverpool. He made thevoyage, visited London, and returned in the same ship. 'Redburn:His First Voyage,' published in 1849, is partly founded on theexperiences of this trip, which was undertaken with the fullconsent of his relatives, and which seems to have satisfied hisnautical ambition for a time. As told in the book, Melville metwith more than the usual hardships of a sailor-boy's firstventure. It does not seem difficult in 'Redburn' to separate theauthor's actual experiences from those invented by him, thisbeing the case in some of his other writings.</p><p> A good part of the succeeding three years, from 1837 to 1840, wasoccupied with school-teaching. While so engaged at Greenbush,now East Albany, N.Y., he received the munificent salary of 'sixdollars a quarter and board.' He taught for one term atPittsfield, Mass., 'boarding around' with the families of hispupils, in true American fashion, and easily suppressing, on onememorable occasion, the efforts of his larger scholars toinaugurate a rebellion by physical force.</p><p> I fancy that it was the reading of Richard Henry Dana's 'TwoYears Before the Mast' which revived the spirit of adventure inMelville's breast. That book was published in 1840, and was atonce talked of everywhere. Melville must have read it at thetime, mindful of his own experience as a sailor. At any rate, heonce more signed a ship's articles, and on January 1, 1841,sailed from New Bedford harbour in the whaler Acushnet, bound forthe Pacific Ocean and the sperm fishery. He has left very littledirect information as to the events of this eighteen months'cruise, although his whaling romance, 'Moby Dick; or, the Whale,'probably gives many pictures of life on board the Acushnet. Inthe present volume he confines himself to a general account ofthe captain's bad treatment of the crew, and of hisnon-fulfilment of agreements. Under these considerations,Melville decided to abandon the vessel on reaching the MarquesasIslands; and the narrative of 'Typee' begins at this point.However, he always recognised the immense influence the voyagehad had upon his career, and in regard to its results has said in'Moby Dick,'--</p><p> 'If I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but highhushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; ifhereafter I shall do anything that on the whole a man mightrather have done than to have left undone . . . .then here Iprospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling;for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.' </p><p> The record, then, of Melville's escape from the Dolly, otherwisethe Acushnet, the sojourn of his companion Toby and himself inthe Typee Valley on the island of Nukuheva, Toby's mysteriousdisappearance, and Melville's own escape, is fully given in thesucceeding pages; and rash indeed would he be who would enterinto a descriptive contest with these inimitable pictures ofaboriginal life in the 'Happy Valley.' So great an interest hasalways centred in the character of Toby, whose actual existencehas been questioned, that I am glad to be able to declare him anauthentic personage, by name Richard T. Greene. He was enabledto discover himself again to Mr. Melville through the publicationof the present volume, and their acquaintance was renewed,lasting for quite a long period. I have seen his portrait,--arare old daguerrotype,--and some of his letters to our author. One of his children was named for the latter, but Mr. Melvillelost trace of him in recent years.</p><p> With the author's rescue from what Dr. T. M. Coan has styled his'anxious paradise,' 'Typee' ends, and its sequel, 'Omoo,' begins.Here, again, it seems wisest to leave the remaining adventures inthe South Seas to the reader's own discovery, simply statingthat, after a sojourn at the Society Islands, Melville shippedfor Honolulu. There he remained for four months, employed as aclerk. He joined the crew of the American frigate United States,which reached Boston, stopping on the way at one of the Peruvianports, in October of 1844. Once more was a narrative of hisexperiences to be preserved in 'White Jacket; or, the World in aMan-of-War.' Thus, of Melville's four most important books,three, 'Typee,' 'Omoo,' and 'White-Jacket,' are directly autobiographical, and 'Moby Dick' is partially so; while the lessimportant 'Redburn' is between the two classes in this respect. Melville's other prose works, as will be shown, were, with someexceptions, unsuccessful efforts at creative romance.</p><p> Whether our author entered on his whaling adventures in the SouthSeas with a determination to make them available for literarypurposes, may never be certainly known. There was no suchelaborate announcement or advance preparation as in some latercases. I am inclined to believe that the literary prospect wasan after-thought, and that this insured a freshness andenthusiasm of style not otherwise to be attained. Returning tohis mother's home at Lansingburg, Melville soon began the writingof 'Typee,' which was completed by the autumn of 1845. Shortlyafter this his older brother, Gansevoort Melville, sailed forEngland as secretary of legation to Ambassador McLane, and themanuscript was intrusted to Gansevoort for submission to JohnMurray. Its immediate acceptance and publication followed in1846. 'Typee' was dedicated to Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw ofMassachusetts, an old friendship between the author's family andthat of Justice Shaw having been renewed about this time. Mr.Melville became engaged to Miss Elizabeth Shaw, the only daughterof the Chief Justice, and their marriage followed on August 4,1847, in Boston. </p><p> The wanderings of our nautical Othello were thus brought to aconclusion. Mr. and Mrs. Melville resided in New York City until1850, when they purchased a farmhouse at Pittsfield, their farmadjoining that formerly owned by Mr. Melville's uncle, which hadbeen inherited by the latter's son. The new place was named'Arrow Head,' from the numerous Indian antiquities found in theneighbourhood. The house was so situated as to command anuninterrupted view of Greylock Mountain and the adjacent hills.Here Melville remained for thirteen years, occupied with hiswriting, and managing his farm. An article in Putnam's Monthlyentitled 'I and My Chimney,' another called 'October Mountain,'and the introduction to the 'Piazza Tales,' present faithfulpictures of Arrow Head and its surroundings. In a letter toNathaniel Hawthorne, given in 'Nathaniel Hawthorne and His Wife,'his daily life is set forth. The letter is dated June 1, 1851. </p><p> 'Since you have been here I have been building some shanties ofhouses (connected with the old one), and likewise some shantiesof chapters and essays. I have been ploughing and sowing andraising and printing and praying, and now begin to come out upona less bristling time, and to enjoy the calm prospect of thingsfrom a fair piazza at the north of the old farmhouse here. Notentirely yet, though, am I without something to be urgent with.The 'Whale' is only half through the press; for, wearied with thelong delays of the printers, and disgusted with the heat and dustof the Babylonish brick-kiln of New York, I came back to thecountry to feel the grass, and end the book reclining on it, if Imay.' </p><p> Mr. Hawthorne, who was then living in the red cottage at Lenox,had a week at Arrow Head with his daughter Una the previousspring. It is recorded that the friends 'spent most of the timein the barn, bathing in the early spring sunshine, which streamedthrough the open doors, and talking philosophy.' According toMr. J. E. A. Smith's volume on the Berkshire Hills, thesegentlemen, both reserved in nature, though near neighbours andoften in the same company, were inclined to be shy of each other,partly, perhaps, through the knowledge that Melville had writtena very appreciative review of 'Mosses from an Old Manse' for theNew York Literary World, edited by their mutual friends, theDuyckincks. 'But one day,' writes Mr. Smith, 'it chanced thatwhen they were out on a picnic excursion, the two were compelledby a thundershower to take shelter in a narrow recess of therocks of Monument Mountain. Two hours of this enforcedintercourse settled the matter. They learned so much of eachother's character, . . . that the most intimate friendship forthe future was inevitable.' A passage in Hawthorne's 'WonderBook' is noteworthy as describing the number of literaryneighbours in Berkshire:--</p><p> 'For my part, I wish I had Pegasus here at this moment,' said thestudent. 'I would mount him forthwith, and gallop about thecountry within a circumference of a few miles, making literarycalls on my brother authors. Dr. Dewey would be within rayreach, at the foot of the Taconic. In Stockbridge, yonder, isMr. James [G. P. R. James], conspicuous to all the world on hismountain-pile of history and romance. Longfellow, I believe, isnot yet at the Oxbow, else the winged horse would neigh at him.But here in Lenox I should find our most truthful novelist [MissSedgwick], who has made the scenery and life of Berkshire all herown. On the hither side of Pittsfield sits Herman Melville,shaping out the gigantic conception of his 'White Whale,' whilethe gigantic shadow of Greylock looms upon him from his studywindow. Another bound of my flying steed would bring me to thedoor of Holmes, whom I mention last, because Pegasus wouldcertainly unseat me the next minute, and claim the poet as hisrider.'</p><p> While at Pittsfield, Mr. Melville was induced to enter thelecture field. From 1857 to 1860 he filled many engagements inthe lyceums, chiefly speaking of his adventures in the SouthSeas. He lectured in cities as widely apart as Montreal,Chicago, Baltimore, and San Francisco, sailing to the last-namedplace in 1860, by way of Cape Horn, on the Meteor, commanded, byhis younger brother, Captain Thomas Melville, afterward governorof the 'Sailor's Snug Harbor' at Staten Island, N.Y. Besides hisvoyage to San Francisco, he had, in 1849 and 1856, visitedEngland, the Continent, and the Holy Land, partly to superintendthe publication of English editions of his works, and partly forrecreation.</p><p> A pronounced feature of Melville's character was hisunwillingness to speak of himself, his adventures, or hiswritings in conversation. He was, however, able to overcome thisreluctance on the lecture platform. Our author's tendency tophilosophical discussion is strikingly set forth in a letter fromDr. Titus Munson Coan to the latter's mother, written while astudent at Williams College over thirty years ago, andfortunately preserved by her. Dr. Coan enjoyed the friendshipand confidence of Mr. Melville during most of his residence inNew York. The letter reads:--</p><p> 'I have made my first literary pilgrimage, a call upon HermanMelville,the renowned author of 'Typee,' etc. He lives in aspacious farmhouse about two miles from Pittsfield, a weary walkthrough the dust. But it as well repaid. I introduced myself asa Hawaiian-American, and soon found myself in full tide of talk,or rather of monologue. But he would not repeat the experiencesof which I had been reading with rapture in his books. In vain Isought to hear of Typee and those paradise islands, but hepreferred to pour forth his philosophy and his theories of life.The shade of Aristotle arose like a cold mist between myself andFayaway. We have quite enough of deep philosophy at WilliamsCollege, and I confess I was disappointed in this trend of thetalk. But what a talk it was! Melville is transformed from aMarquesan to a gypsy student, the gypsy element still remainingstrong within him. And this contradiction gives him the air ofone who has suffered from opposition, both literary and social.With his liberal views, he is apparently considered by the goodpeople of Pittsfield as little better than a cannibal or a'beach-comber.' His attitude seemed to me something like that ofIshmael; but perhaps I judged hastily. I managed to draw him outvery freely on everything but the Marquesas Islands, and when Ileft him he was in full tide of discourse on all things sacredand profane. But he seems to put away the objective side of hislife, and to shut himself up in this cold north as a cloisteredthinker.' </p><p> I have been told by Dr. Coan that his father, the Rev. TitusCoan, of the Hawaiian Islands, personally visited the Marquesasgroup, found the Typee Valley, and verified in all respects thestatements made in 'Typee.' It is known that Mr. Melville fromearly manhood indulged deeply in philosophical studies, and hisfondness for discussing such matters is pointed out by Hawthornealso, in the 'English Note Books.' This habit increased as headvanced in years, if possible.</p><p> The chief event of the residence in Pittsfield was the completionand publication of 'Moby Dick; or, the Whale,' in 1851. How manyyoung men have been drawn to sea by this book is a question ofinterest. Meeting with Mr. Charles Henry Webb ('John Paul') theday after Mr. Melville's death, I asked him if he were notfamiliar with that author's writings. He replied that 'MobyDick' was responsible for his three years of life before the mastwhen a lad, and added that while 'gamming' on board anothervessel he had once fallen in with a member of the boat's crewwhich rescued Melville from his friendly imprisonment among theTypees.</p><p> While at Pittsfield, besides his own family, Mr. Melville'smother and sisters resided with him. As his four children grewup he found it necessary to obtain for them better facilities forstudy than the village school afforded; and so, several yearsafter, the household was broken up, and he removed with his wifeand children to the New York house that was afterwards his home.This house belonged to his brother Allan, and was exchanged forthe estate at Pittsfield. In December, 1866, he was appointed byMr. H. A. Smyth, a former travelling companion in Europe, adistrict officer in the New York Custom House. He held theposition until 1886, preferring it to in-door clerical work, andthen resigned, the duties becoming too arduous for his failingstrength.</p><p> In addition to his philosophical studies, Mr. Melville was muchinterested in all matters relating to the fine arts, and devotedmost of his leisure hours to the two subjects. A notablecollection of etchings and engravings from the old masters wasgradually made by him, those from Claude's paintings being aspecialty. After he retired from the Custom House, his tall,stalwart figure could be seen almost daily tramping through theFort George district or Central Park, his roving inclinationleading him to obtain as much out-door life as possible. Hisevenings were spent at home with his books, his pictures, and hisfamily, and usually with them alone; for, in spite of themelodramatic declarations of various English gentlemen,Melville's seclusion in his latter years, and in fact throughouthis life, was a matter of personal choice. More and more, as hegrew older, he avoided every action on his part, and on the partof his family, that might tend to keep his name and writingsbefore the public. A few friends felt at liberty to visit therecluse, and were kindly welcomed, but he himself sought no one.His favorite companions were his grandchildren, with whom hedelighted to pass his time, and his devoted wife, who was aconstant assistant and adviser in his literary work, chiefly doneat this period for his own amusement. To her he addressed hislast little poem, the touching 'Return of the Sire de Nesle.'Various efforts were made by the New York literary colony to drawhim from his retirement, but without success. It has beensuggested that he might have accepted a magazine editorship, butthis is doubtful, as he could not bear business details orroutine work of any sort. His brother Allan was a New Yorklawyer, and until his death, in 1872, managed Melville's affairswith ability, particularly the literary accounts.</p><p> During these later years he took great pleasure in a friendlycorrespondence with Mr. W. Clark Russell. Mr. Russell had takenmany occasions to mention Melville's sea-tales, his interest inthem, and his indebtedness to them. The latter felt impelled towrite Mr. Russell in regard to one of his newly published novels,and received in answer the following letter: July 21, 1886. </p><p> MY DEAR Mr. MELVILLE, Your letter has given me a very great andsingular pleasure. Your delightful books carry the imaginationinto a maritime period so remote that, often as you have been inmy mind, I could never satisfy myself that you were still amongstthe living. I am glad, indeed, to learn from Mr. Toft that youare still hale and hearty, and I do most heartily wish you manyyears yet of health and vigour.</p><p> Your books I have in the American edition. I have 'Typee,'Omoo,' 'Redburn,' and that noble piece 'Moby Dick.' These areall I have been able to obtain. There have been many editions ofyour works in this country, particularly the lovely South Seasketches; but the editions are not equal to those of the Americanpublishers. Your reputation here is very great. It is hard tomeet a man whose opinion as a reader is worth leaving who doesnot speak of your works in such terms as he might hesitate toemploy, with all his patriotism, toward many renowned Englishwriters.</p><p> Dana is, indeed, great. There is nothing in literature moreremarkable than the impression produced by Dana's portraiture ofthe homely inner life of a little brig's forecastle.</p><p> I beg that you will accept my thanks for the kindly spirit inwhich you have read my books. I wish it were in my power tocross the Atlantic, for you assuredly would be the first whom itwould be my happiness to visit.</p><p> The condition of my right hand obliges me to dictate this to myson; but painful as it is to me to hold a pen, I cannot sufferthis letter to reach the hands of a man of so admirable genitisas Herman Melville without begging him to believe me to be, withmy own hand, his most respectful and hearty admirer,W. Clark Russell. </p><p> It should be noted here that Melville's increased reputation inEngland at the period of this letter was chiefly owing to aseries of articles on his work written by Mr. Russell. I amsorry to say that few English papers made more than a passingreference to Melville's death. The American press discussed hislife and work in numerous and lengthy reviews. At the same time,there always has been a steady sale of his books in England, andsome of them never have been out of print in that country sincethe publication of 'Typee.' One result of this friendshipbetween the two authors was the dedication of new volumes to eachother in highly complimentary terms--Mr. Melville's 'John Marrand Other Sailors,' of which twenty-five copies only wereprinted, on the one hand, and Mr. Russell's 'An Ocean Tragedy,'on the other, of which many thousand have been printed, not tomention unnumbered pirated copies.</p><p> Beside Hawthorne, Mr. Richard Henry Stoddard, of Americanwriters, specially knew and appreciated Herman Melville. Mr.Stoddard was connected with the New York dock department at thetime of Mr. Melville's appointment to a custom-house position,and they at once became acquainted. For a good many years,during the period in which our author remained in seclusion, muchthat appeared in print in America concerning Melville came fromthe pen of Mr. Stoddard. Nevertheless, the sailor author'spresence in New York was well known to the literary guild. Hewas invited to join in all new movements, but as often feltobliged to excuse himself from doing so. The present writerlived for some time within a short distance of his house, butfound no opportunity to meet him until it became necessary toobtain his portrait for an anthology in course of publication. The interview was brief, and the interviewer could not helpfeeling although treated with pleasant courtesy, that moreimportant matters were in hand than the perpetuation of aromancer's countenance to future generations; but a friendlyfamily acquaintance grew up from the incident, and will remain anabiding memory.</p><p> Mr. Melville died at his home in New York City early on themorning of September 28, 1891. His serious illness had lasted anumber of months, so that the end came as a release. True to hisruling passion, philosophy had claimed him to the last, a set ofSchopenhauer's works receiving his attention when able to study;but this was varied with readings in the 'Mermaid Series' of oldplays, in which he took much pleasure. His library, in additionto numerous works on philosophy and the fine arts, was composedof standard books of all classes, including, of course, aproportion of nautical literature. Especially interesting arefifteen or twenty first editions of Hawthorne's books inscribedto Mr. and Mrs. Melville by the author and his wife. </p><p> The immediate acceptance of 'Typee' by John Murray was followedby an arrangement with the London agent of an American publisher,for its simultaneous publication in the United States. Iunderstand that Murray did not then publish fiction. At anyrate, the book was accepted by him on the assurance of GansevoortMelville that it contained nothing not actually experienced byhis brother. Murray brought it out early in 1846, in hisColonial and Home Library, as 'A Narrative of a Four Months'Residence among the Natives of a Valley of the Marquesas Islands;or, a Peep at Polynesian Life,' or, more briefly, 'Melville'sMarquesas Islands.' It was issued in America with the author'sown title, 'Typee,' and in the outward shape of a work offiction. Mr. Melville found himself famous at once. Manydiscussions were carried on as to the genuineness of the author'sname and the reality of the events portrayed, but English andAmerican critics alike recognised the book's importance as acontribution to literature.</p><p> Melville, in a letter to Hawthorne, speaks of himself as havingno development at all until his twenty-fifth year, the time ofhis return from the Pacific; but surely the process ofdevelopment must have been well advanced to permit of so virileand artistic a creation as 'Typee.' While the narrative does notalways run smoothly, yet the style for the most part is gracefuland alluring, so that we pass from one scene of Pacificenchantment to another quite oblivious of the vast amount ofdescriptive detail which is being poured out upon us. It is thevarying fortune of the hero which engrosses our attention. Wefollow his adventures with breathless interest, or luxuriate withhim in the leafy bowers of the 'Happy Valley,' surrounded byjoyous children of nature. When all is ended, we then for thefirst time realise that we know these people and their ways as ifwe too had dwelt among them.</p><p> I do not believe that 'Typee' will ever lose its position as aclassic of American Literature. The pioneer in South Searomance- -for the mechanical descriptions of earlier voyagers arenot worthy of comparison--this book has as yet met with nosuperior, even in French literature; nor has it met with a rivalin any other language than the French. The character of'Fayaway,' and, no less, William S. Mayo's 'Kaloolah,' theenchanting dreams of many a youthful heart, will retain theircharm; and this in spite of endless variations by modernexplorers in the same domain. A faint type of both charactersmay be found in the Surinam Yarico of Captain John GabrielStedman, whose 'Narrative of a Five Years' Expedition' appearedin 1796.</p><p> 'Typee,' as written, contained passages reflecting withconsiderable severity on the methods pursued by missionaries inthe South Seas. The manuscript was printed in a complete form inEngland, and created much discussion on this account, Melvillebeing accused of bitterness; but he asserted his lack ofprejudice. The passages referred to were omitted in the firstand all subsequent American editions. They have been restored inthe present issue, which is complete save for a few paragraphsexcluded by written direction of the author. I have, with theconsent of his family, changed the long and cumbersome sub-titleof the book, calling it a 'Real-Romance of the South Seas,' asbest expressing its nature.</p><p> The success of his first volume encouraged Melville to proceed inhis work, and 'Omoo,' the sequel to 'Typee,' appeared in Englandand America in l847. Here we leave, for the most part, thedreamy pictures of island life, and find ourselves sharing theextremely realistic discomforts of a Sydney whaler in the earlyforties. The rebellious crew's experiences in the Society Islandsare quite as realistic as events on board ship and veryentertaining, while the whimsical character, Dr. Long Ghost, nextto Captain Ahab in 'Moby Dick,' is Melville's most strikingdelineation. The errors of the South Sea missions are pointedout with even more force than in 'Typee,' and it is a fact thatboth these books have ever since been of the greatest value tooutgoing missionaries on account of the exact informationcontained in them with respect to the islanders.</p><p> Melville's power in describing and investing with romance scenesand incidents witnessed and participated in by himself, and hisfrequent failure of success as an inventor of characters andsituations, were early pointed out by his critics. More recentlyMr. Henry S. Salt has drawn the same distinction very carefullyin an excellent article contributed to the Scottish Art Review.In a prefatory note to 'Mardi' (1849), Melville declares that, ashis former books have been received as romance instead ofreality, he will now try his hand at pure fiction. 'Mardi' maybe called a splendid failure. It must have been soon after thecompletion of 'Omoo' that Melville began to study the writings ofSir Thomas Browne. Heretofore our author's style was rough inplaces, but marvellously simple and direct. 'Mardi' is burdenedwith an over-rich diction, which Melville never entirely outgrew.The scene of this romance, which opens well, is laid in the SouthSeas, but everything soon becomes overdrawn and fantastical, andthe thread of the story loses itself in a mystical allegory. </p><p> 'Redburn,' already mentioned, succeeded 'Mardi' in the same year,and was a partial return to the author's earlier style. In'White-Jacket; or, the World in a Man-of-War' (1850), Melvillealmost regained it. This book has no equal as a picture of lifeaboard a sailing man-of-war, the lights and shadows of navalexistence being well contrasted.</p><p> With 'Moby Dick; or, the Whale' (1851), Melville reached thetopmost notch of his fame. The book represents, to a certainextent, the conflict between the author's earlier and latermethods of composition, but the gigantic conception of the 'WhiteWhale,' as Hawthorne expressed it, permeates the whole work, andlifts it bodily into the highest domain of romance. 'Moby Dick'contains an immense amount of information concerning the habitsof the whale and the methods of its capture, but this ischaracteristically introduced in a way not to interfere with thenarrative. The chapter entitled 'Stubb Kills a Whale' ranks withthe choicest examples of descriptive literature.</p><p> 'Moby Dick' appeared, and Melville enjoyed to the full theenhanced reputation it brought him. He did not, however, takewarning from 'Mardi,' but allowed himself to plunge more deeplyinto the sea of philosophy and fantasy.</p><p> 'Pierre; or, the Ambiguities' (1852) was published, and thereensued a long series of hostile criticisms, ending with a severe,though impartial, article by Fitz-James O'Brien in Putnam'sMonthly. About the same time the whole stock of the author'sbooks was destroyed by fire, keeping them out of print at acritical moment; and public interest, which until then had beenon the increase, gradually began to diminish.</p><p> After this Mr. Melville contributed several short stories toPutnam's Monthly and Harper's Magazine. Those in the formerperiodical were collected in a volume as Piazza Tales (1856); andof these 'Benito Cereno' and 'The Bell Tower' are equal to hisbest previous efforts.</p><p> 'Israel Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile' (1855), first printedas a serial in Putnam's, is an historical romance of the AmericanRevolution, based on the hero's own account of his adventures, asgiven in a little volume picked up by Mr. Melville at abook-stall. The story is well told, but the book is hardlyworthy of the author of 'Typee.' 'The Confidence Man' (1857),his last serious effort in prose fiction, does not seem torequire criticism. </p><p> Mr. Melville's pen had rested for nearly ten years, when it wasagain taken up to celebrate the events of the Civil War. 'BattlePieces and Aspects of the War' appeared in 1866. Most of thesepoems originated, according to the author, in an impulse impartedby the fall of Richmond; but they have as subjects all the chiefincidents of the struggle. The best of them are "The StoneFleet,' 'In the Prison Pen,' 'The College Colonel,' 'The March tothe Sea,' 'Running the Batteries,' and 'Sheridan at Cedar Creek.'Some of these had a wide circulation in the press, and werepreserved in various anthologies. 'Clarel, a Poem and Pilgrimagein the Holy Land' (1876), is a long mystical poem requiring, assome one has said, a dictionary, a cyclopaedia, and a copy of theBible for its elucidation. in the two privately printed volumes,the arrangement of which occupied Mr. Melville during his lastillness, there are several fine lyrics. The titles of thesebooks are, 'John Marr and Other Sailors' (1888), and 'Timoleon'(1891).</p><p> There is no question that Mr. Melville's absorption inphilosophical studies was quite as responsible as the failure ofhis later books for his cessation from literary productiveness.That he sometimes realised the situation will be seen by apassage in 'Moby Dick':--</p><p> 'Didn't I tell you so?' said Flask. 'Yes, you'll soon see thisright whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti's.'</p><p> 'In good time Flask's saying proved true. As before, the Pequodsteeply leaned over towards the sperm whale's head, now, by thecounterpoise of both heads, she regained her own keel, thoughsorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side youhoist in Locke's head, you go over that way; but now, on theother side, hoist in Kant's and you come back again; but in verypoor plight. Thus, some minds forever keep trimming boat. Oh,ye foolish! throw all these thunderheads overboard, and then youwill float right and light.'</p><p> Mr. Melville would have been more than mortal if he had beenindifferent to his loss of popularity. Yet he seemed contentedto preserve an entirely independent attitude, and to trust to theverdict of the future. The smallest amount of activity wouldhave kept him before the public; but his reserve would not permitthis. That reinstatement of his reputation cannot be doubted. </p><p> In the editing of this reissue of 'Melville's Works,' I have beenmuch indebted to the scholarly aid of Dr. Titus Munson Coan,whose familiarity with the languages of the Pacific has enabledme to harmonise the spelling of foreign words in 'Typee' and'Omoo,' though without changing the phonetic method of printingadopted by Mr. Melville. Dr. Coan has also been most helpfulwith suggestions in other directions.

cruising after the sperm-whale beneath thescorching sun of the Line, and tossed on the billows of thewide-rolling Pacific--the sky above, the sea around, and nothingelse!&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeks and weeks ago our fresh provisions were allexhausted.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a sweet potato left; not a single yam.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those glorious bunches of bananas, which once decorated our sternand quarter-deck, have, alas, disappeared!&nbsp;&nbsp;and the deliciousoranges which hung suspended from our tops and stays--they, too,are gone!&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they are all departed, and there is nothing leftus but salt-horse and sea-biscuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh!&nbsp;&nbsp;ye state-room sailors,who make so much ado about a fourteen-days' passage across theAtlantic; who so pathetically relate the privations and hardshipsof the sea, where, after a day of breakfasting, lunching, diningoff five courses, chatting, playing whist, and drinkingchampagne-punch, it was your hard lot to be shut up in littlecabinets of mahogany and maple, and sleep for ten hours, withnothing to disturb you but 'those good-for-nothing tars, shoutingand tramping overhead',--what would ye say to our six months outof sight of land?</p><p> Oh!&nbsp;&nbsp;for a refreshing glimpse of one blade of grass--for a snuffat the fragrance of a handful of the loamy earth!&nbsp;&nbsp;Is therenothing fresh around us?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there no green thing to be seen?&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the inside of our bulwarks is painted green; but what a vileand sickly hue it is, as if nothing bearing even the semblance ofverdure could flourish this weary way from land.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the barkthat once clung to the wood we use for fuel has been gnawed offand devoured by the captain's pig; and so long ago, too, that thepig himself has in turn been devoured.</p><p> There is but one solitary tenant in the chicken-coop, once a gayand dapper young cock, bearing him so bravely among the coy hens.</p><p> But look at him now; there he stands, moping all the day long onthat everlasting one leg of his.&nbsp;&nbsp;He turns with disgust from themouldy corn before him, and the brackish water in his littletrough.&nbsp;&nbsp;He mourns no doubt his lost companions, literallysnatched from him one by one, and never seen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;But his daysof mourning will be few for Mungo, our black cook, told meyesterday that the word had at last gone forth, and poor Pedro'sfate was sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;His attenuated body will be laid out upon thecaptain's table next Sunday, and long before night will be buriedwith all the usual ceremonies beneath that worthy individual'svest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would believe that there could be any one so cruel asto long for the decapitation of the luckless Pedro; yet thesailors pray every minute, selfish fellows, that the miserablefowl may be brought to his end.&nbsp;&nbsp;They say the captain will neverpoint the ship for the land so long as he has in anticipation amess of fresh meat.&nbsp;&nbsp;This unhappy bird can alone furnish it; andwhen he is once devoured, the captain will come to his senses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iwish thee no harm, Pedro; but as thou art doomed, sooner orlater, to meet the fate of all thy race; and if putting a periodto thy existence is to be the signal for our deliverance,why--truth to speak--I wish thy throat cut this very moment; for,oh!&nbsp;&nbsp;how I wish to see the living earth again!&nbsp;&nbsp;The old shipherself longs to look out upon the land from her hawse-holes oncemore, and Jack Lewis said right the other day when the captainfound fault with his steering.</p><p> 'Why d'ye see, Captain Vangs,' says bold Jack, 'I'm as good ahelmsman as ever put hand to spoke; but none of us can steer theold lady now.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can't keep her full and bye, sir; watch herever so close, she will fall off and then, sir, when I put thehelm down so gently, and try like to coax her to the work, shewon't take it kindly, but will fall round off again; and it's allbecause she knows the land is under the lee, sir, and she won'tgo any more to windward.'&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, and why should she, Jack?&nbsp;&nbsp;didn'tevery one of her stout timbers grow on shore, and hasn't shesensibilities; as well as we?</p><p> Poor old ship!&nbsp;&nbsp;Her very looks denote her desires!&nbsp;&nbsp;howdeplorably she appears!&nbsp;&nbsp;The paint on her sides, burnt up by thescorching sun, is puffed out and cracked.&nbsp;&nbsp;See the weeds shetrails along with her, and what an unsightly bunch of thosehorrid barnacles has formed about her stern-piece; and every timeshe rises on a sea, she shows her copper torn away, or hanging injagged strips.</p><p> Poor old ship!&nbsp;&nbsp;I say again: for six months she has been rollingand pitching about, never for one moment at rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;But courage,old lass, I hope to see thee soon within a biscuit's toss of themerry land, riding snugly at anchor in some green cove, andsheltered from the boisterous winds.</p><p> .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> 'Hurra, my lads!&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a settled thing; next week we shape ourcourse to the Marquesas!'&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquesas!&nbsp;&nbsp;What strange visionsof outlandish things does the very name spirit up!&nbsp;&nbsp;Nakedhouris--cannibal banquets--groves of cocoanut--coralreefs--tattooed chiefs--and bamboo temples; sunny valleys plantedwith bread-fruit-trees--carved canoes dancing on the flashingblue waters--savage woodlands guarded by horribleidols--HEATHENISH RITES AND HUMAN SACRIFICES.</p><p> Such were the strangely jumbled anticipations that haunted meduring our passage from the cruising ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt anirresistible curiosity to see those islands which the oldenvoyagers had so glowingly described.</p><p> The group for which we were now steering (although among theearliest of European discoveries in the South Seas, having beenfirst visited in the year 1595) still continues to be tenanted bybeings as strange and barbarous as ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;The missionaries senton a heavenly errand, had sailed by their lovely shores, and hadabandoned them to their idols of wood and stone.&nbsp;&nbsp;How interestingthe circumstances under which they were discovered!&nbsp;&nbsp;In thewatery path of Mendanna, cruising in quest of some region ofgold, these isles had sprung up like a scene of enchantment, andfor a moment the Spaniard believed his bright dream was realized.</p><p> In honour of the Marquess de Mendoza, then viceroy of Peru--underwhose auspices the navigator sailed--he bestowed upon them thename which denoted the rank of his patron, and gave to the worldon his return a vague and magnificent account of their beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp;But these islands, undisturbed for years, relapsed into theirprevious obscurity; and it is only recently that anything hasbeen known concerning them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in the course of a halfcentury, to be sure, some adventurous rover would break in upontheir peaceful repose.&nbsp;&nbsp;and astonished at the unusual scene,would be almost tempted to claim the merit of a new discovery.</p><p> Of this interesting group, but little account has ever beengiven, if we except the slight mention made of them in thesketches of South-Sea voyages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cook, in his repeatedcircumnavigations of the globe, barely touched at their shores;and all that we know about them is from a few general narratives.</p><p> Among these, there are two that claim particular notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Porter's 'Journal of the Cruise of the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;frigate Essex, inthe Pacific, during the late War', is said to contain someinteresting particulars concerning the islanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is awork, however, which I have never happened to meet with; andStewart, the chaplain of the American sloop of war Vincennes, haslikewise devoted a portion of his book, entitled 'A Visit to theSouth Seas', to the same subject.</p><p> Within the last few, years American and English vessels engagedin the extensive whale fisheries of the Pacific haveoccasionally, when short of provisions, put into the commodiousharbour which there is in one of the islands; but a fear of thenatives, founded on the recollection of the dreadful fate whichmany white men have received at their hands, has deterred theircrews from intermixing with the population sufficiently to gainany insight into their peculiar customs and manners.</p><p> The Protestant Missions appear to have despaired of reclaimingthese islands from heathenism.&nbsp;&nbsp;The usage they have in every casereceived from the natives has been such as to intimidate theboldest of their number.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis, in his 'Polynesian Researches',gives some interesting accounts of the abortive attempts made bythe ''Tahiti Mission'' to establish a branch Mission upon certainislands of the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;A short time before my visit to theMarquesas, a somewhat amusing incident took place in connectionwith these efforts, which I cannot avoid relating.</p><p> An intrepid missionary, undaunted by the ill-success that hadattended all previous endeavours to conciliate the savages, andbelieving much in the efficacy of female influence, introducedamong them his young and beautiful wife, the first white womanwho had ever visited their shores.&nbsp;&nbsp;The islanders at first gazedin mute admiration at so unusual a prodigy, and seemed inclinedto regard it as some new divinity.&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a short time,becoming familiar with its charming aspect, and jealous of thefolds which encircled its form, they sought to pierce the sacredveil of calico in which it was enshrined, and in thegratification of their curiosity so far overstepped the limits ofgood breeding, as deeply to offend the lady's sense of decorum.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sex once ascertained, their idolatry was changed intocontempt and there was no end to the contumely showered upon herby the savages, who were exasperated at the deception which theyconceived had been practised upon them.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the horror of heraffectionate spouse, she was stripped of her garments, and givento understand that she could no longer carry on her deceits withimpunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle dame was not sufficiently evangelical toendure this, and, fearful of further improprieties, she forcedher husband to relinquish his undertaking, and together theyreturned to Tahiti.</p><p> Not thus shy of exhibiting her charms was the Island Queenherself, the beauteous wife of Movianna, the king of Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between two and three years after the adventures recorded in thisvolume, I chanced, while aboard of a man-of-war to touch at theseislands.&nbsp;&nbsp;The French had then held possession of the Marquesassome time, and already prided themselves upon the beneficialeffects of their jurisdiction, as discernible in the deportmentof the natives.&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, in one of their efforts at reformthey had slaughtered about a hundred and fifty of them atWhitihoo--but let that pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I mention, the Frenchsquadron was rendezvousing in the bay of Nukuheva, and during aninterview between one of their captains and our worthy Commodore,it was suggested by the former, that we, as the flag-ship of theAmerican squadron, should receive, in state, a visit from theroyal pair.&nbsp;&nbsp;The French officer likewise represented, withevident satisfaction, that under their tuition the king and queenhad imbibed proper notions of their elevated station, and on allceremonious occasions conducted themselves with suitable dignity. Accordingly, preparations were made to give their majesties areception on board in a style corresponding with their rank.</p><p> One bright afternoon, a gig, gaily bedizened with streamers, wasobserved to shove off from the side of one of the Frenchfrigates, and pull directly for our gangway.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stem sheetsreclined Mowanna and his consort.&nbsp;&nbsp;As they approached, we paidthem all the honours clue to royalty;--manning our yards, firinga salute, and making a prodigious hubbub.</p><p> They ascended the accommodation ladder, were greeted by theCommodore, hat in hand, and passing along the quarter-deck, themarine guard presented arms, while the band struck up 'The Kingof the Cannibal Islands'.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far all went well.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frenchofficers grimaced and smiled in exceedingly high spirits,wonderfully pleased with the discreet manner in which thesedistinguished personages behaved themselves.</p><p> Their appearance was certainly calculated to produce an effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;His majesty was arrayed in a magnificent military uniform, stiffwith gold lace and embroidery, while his shaven crown wasconcealed by a huge chapeau bras, waving with ostrich plumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one slight blemish, however, in his appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Abroad patch of tattooing stretched completely across his face, ina line with his eyes, making him look as if he wore a huge pairof goggles; and royalty in goggles suggested some ludicrousideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was in the adornment of the fair person of hisdark-complexioned spouse that the tailors of the fleet hadevinced the gaiety of their national taste.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was habited in agaudy tissue of scarlet cloth, trimmed with yellow silk, which,descending a little below the knees, exposed to view her barelegs, embellished with spiral tattooing, and somewhat resemblingtwo miniature Trajan's columns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon her head was a fancifulturban of purple velvet, figured with silver sprigs, andsurmounted by a tuft of variegated feathers.</p><p> The ship's company, crowding into the gangway to view the sight,soon arrested her majesty's attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;She singled out fromtheir number an old salt, whose bare arms and feet, and exposedbreast, were covered with as many inscriptions in India ink asthe lid of an Egyptian sarcophagus.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding all the slyhints and remonstrances of the French officers, she immediatelyapproached the man, and pulling further open the bosom of hisduck frock, and rolling up the leg of his wide trousers, shegazed with admiration at the bright blue and vermilion prickingthus disclosed to view.&nbsp;&nbsp;She hung over the fellow, caressing him,and expressing her delight in a variety of wild exclamations andgestures.&nbsp;&nbsp;The embarrassment of the polite Gauls at such anunlooked-for occurrence may be easily imagined, but picture theirconsternation, when all at once the royal lady, eager to displaythe hieroglyphics on her own sweet form, bent forward for amoment, and turning sharply round, threw up the skirt of hermantle and revealed a sight from which the aghast Frenchmenretreated precipitately, and tumbling into their boats, fled thescene of so shocking a catastrophe.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Two</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWO</p><p> PASSAGE FROM THE CRUISING GROUND TO THE MARQUESAS--SLEEPY TIMESABOARD SHIP--SOUTH SEA SCENERY--LAND HO--THE FRENCH SQUADRONDISCOVERED AT ANCHOR IN THE BAY OF NUKUHEVA--STRANGE PILOT-ESCORT OF CANOES--A FLOTILLA OF COCOANUTS--SWIMMING VISITORS--THEDOLLY BOARDED BY THEM--STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT ENSUE</p><p> I CAN never forget the eighteen or twenty days during which thelight trade-winds were silently sweeping us towards the islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuit of the sperm whale, we had been cruising on the linesome twenty degrees to the westward of the Gallipagos; and allthat we had to do, when our course was determined on, was tosquare in the yards and keep the vessel before the breeze, andthen the good ship and the steady gale did the rest between them. The man at the wheel never vexed the old lady with anysuperfluous steering, but comfortably adjusting his limbs at thetiller, would doze away by the hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;True to her work, the Dollyheaded to her course, and like one of those characters who alwaysdo best when let alone, she jogged on her way like a veteran oldsea-pacer as she was.</p><p> What a delightful, lazy, languid time we had whilst we were thusgliding along!&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing to be done; a circumstance thathappily suited our disinclination to do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;We abandonedthe fore-peak altogether, and spreading an awning over theforecastle, slept, ate, and lounged under it the live-long day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every one seemed to be under the influence of some narcotic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the officers aft, whose duty required them never to beseated while keeping a deck watch, vainly endeavoured to keep ontheir pins; and were obliged invariably to compromise the matterby leaning up against the bulwarks, and gazing abstractedly overthe side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading was out of the question; take a book in yourhand, and you were asleep in an instant.</p><p> Although I could not avoid yielding in a great measure to thegeneral languor, still at times I contrived to shake off thespell, and to appreciate the beauty of the scene around me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thesky presented a clear expanse of the most delicate blue, exceptalong the skirts of the horizon, where you might see a thindrapery of pale clouds which never varied their form or colour.&nbsp;&nbsp;The long, measured, dirge-like well of the Pacific came rollingalong, with its surface broken by little tiny waves, sparkling inthe sunshine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every now and then a shoal of flying fish, scaredfrom the water under the bows, would leap into the air, and fallthe next moment like a shower of silver into the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then youwould see the superb albicore, with his glittering sides, sailingaloft, and often describing an arc in his descent, disappear onthe surface of the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off, the lofty jet of the whalemight be seen, and nearer at hand the prowling shark, thatvillainous footpad of the seas, would come skulking along, and,at a wary distance, regard us with his evil eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, someshapeless monster of the deep, floating on the surface, would, aswe approached, sink slowly into the blue waters, and fade awayfrom the sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most impressive feature of the scene wasthe almost unbroken silence that reigned over sky and water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely a sound could be heard but the occasional breathing ofthe grampus, and the rippling at the cut-water.</p><p> As we drew nearer the land, I hailed with delight the appearanceof innumerable sea-fowl.&nbsp;&nbsp;Screaming and whirling in spiraltracks, they would accompany the vessel, and at times alight onour yards and stays.&nbsp;&nbsp;That piratical-looking fellow,appropriately named the man-of-war's-hawk, with his blood-redbill and raven plumage, would come sweeping round us in graduallydiminishing circles, till you could distinctly mark the strangeflashings of his eye; and then, as if satisfied with hisobservation, would sail up into the air and disappear from theview.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, other evidences of our vicinity to the land wereapparent, and it was not long before the glad announcement of itsbeing in sight was heard from aloft,--given with that peculiarprolongation of sound that a sailor loves--'Land ho!'</p><p> The captain, darting on deck from the cabin, bawled lustily forhis spy-glass; the mate in still louder accents hailed themasthead with a tremendous 'where-away?'&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cook thrusthis woolly head from the galley, and Boatswain, the dog, leapedup between the knight-heads, and barked most furiously.&nbsp;&nbsp;Land ho!Aye, there it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;A hardly perceptible blue irregular outline,indicating the bold contour of the lofty heights of Nukuheva.</p><p> This island, although generally called one of the Marquesas, isby some navigators considered as forming one of a distinctcluster, comprising the islands of Ruhooka, Ropo, and Nukuheva;upon which three the appellation of the Washington Group has beenbestowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;They form a triangle, and lie within the parallels of8 degrees 38" and 9 degrees 32" South latitude and 139 degrees20" and 140 degrees 10" West longitude from Greenwich.&nbsp;&nbsp;With howlittle propriety they are to be regarded as forming a separategroup will be at once apparent, when it is considered that theylie in the immediate vicinity of the other islands, that is tosay, less than a degree to the northwest of them; that theirinhabitants speak the Marquesan dialect, and that their laws,religion, and general customs are identical.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason whythey were ever thus arbitrarily distinguished may be attributedto the singular fact, that their existence was altogether unknownto the world until the year 1791, when they were discovered byCaptain Ingraham, of Boston, Massachusetts, nearly two centuriesafter the discovery of the adjacent islands by the agent of theSpanish Viceroy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, I shall follow theexample of most voyagers, and treat of them as forming part andparcel of Marquesas.</p><p> Nukuheva is the most important of these islands, being the onlyone at which ships are much in the habit of touching, and iscelebrated as being the place where the adventurous CaptainPorter refitted his ships during the late war between England andthe United States, and whence he sallied out upon the largewhaling fleet then sailing under the enemy's flag in thesurrounding seas.&nbsp;&nbsp;This island is about twenty miles in lengthand nearly as many in breadth.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has three good harbours on itscoast; the largest and best of which is called by the peopleliving in its vicinity 'Taiohae', and by Captain Porter wasdenominated Massachusetts Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the adverse tribes dwellingabout the shores of the other bays, and by all voyagers, it isgenerally known by the name bestowed upon the islanditself--Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its inhabitants have become somewhatcorrupted, owing to their recent commerce with Europeans, but sofar as regards their peculiar customs and general mode of life,they retain their original primitive character, remaining verynearly in the same state of nature in which they were firstbeheld by white men.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hostile clans, residing in the moreremote sections of the island, and very seldom holding anycommunication with foreigners, are in every respect unchangedfrom their earliest known condition.</p><p> In the bay of Nukuheva was the anchorage we desired to reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wehad perceived the loom of the mountains about sunset; so thatafter running all night with a very light breeze, we foundourselves close in with the island the next morning, but as thebay we sought lay on its farther side, we were obliged to sailsome distance along the shore, catching, as we proceeded, shortglimpses of blooming valleys, deep glens, waterfalls, and wavinggroves hidden here and there by projecting and rocky headlands,every moment opening to the view some new and startling scene ofbeauty.</p><p> Those who for the first time visit the South Sea, generally aresurprised at the appearance of the islands when beheld from thesea.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the vague accounts we sometimes have of their beauty,many people are apt to picture to themselves enamelled and softlyswelling plains, shaded over with delicious groves, and wateredby purling brooks, and the entire country but little elevatedabove the surrounding ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is very different; boldrock-bound coasts, with the surf beating high against the loftycliffs, and broken here and there into deep inlets, which open tothe view thickly-wooded valleys, separated by the spurs ofmountains clothed with tufted grass, and sweeping down towardsthe sea from an elevated and furrowed interior, form theprincipal features of these islands.</p><p> Towards noon we drew abreast the entrance go the harbour, and atlast we slowly swept by the intervening promontory, and enteredthe bay of Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;No description can do justice to itsbeauty; but that beauty was lost to me then, and I saw nothingbut the tri-coloured flag of France trailing over the stern ofsix vessels, whose black hulls and bristling broadsidesproclaimed their warlike character.&nbsp;&nbsp;There they were, floating inthat lovely bay, the green eminences of the shore looking down sotranquilly upon them, as if rebuking the sternness of theiraspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my eye nothing could be more out of keeping than thepresence of these vessels; but we soon learnt what brought themthere.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole group of islands had just been taken possessionof by Rear-Admiral Du Petit Thouars, in the name of theinvincible French nation.</p><p> This item of information was imparted to us by a mostextraordinary individual, a genuine South-Sea vagabond, who camealongside of us in a whale-boat as soon as we entered the bay,and, by the aid of some benevolent persons at the gangway, wasassisted on board, for our visitor was in that interesting stageof intoxication when a man is amiable and helpless.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although hewas utterly unable to stand erect or to navigate his body acrossthe deck, he still magnanimously proffered his services to pilotthe ship to a good and secure anchorage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our captain, however,rather distrusted his ability in this respect, and refused torecognize his claim to the character he assumed; but ourgentleman was determined to play his part, for, by dint of muchscrambling, he succeeded in getting into the weather-quarterboat, where he steadied himself by holding on to a shroud, andthen commenced issuing his commands with amazing volubility andvery peculiar gestures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course no one obeyed his orders; butas it was impossible to quiet him, we swept by the ships of thesquadron with this strange fellow performing his antics in fullview of all the French officers.</p><p> We afterwards learned that our eccentric friend had been alieutenant in the English navy; but having disgraced his flag bysome criminal conduct in one of the principal ports on the main,he had deserted his ship, and spent many years wandering amongthe islands of the Pacific, until accidentally being at Nukuhevawhen the French took possession of the place, he had beenappointed pilot of the harbour by the newly constitutedauthorities.</p><p> As we slowly advanced up the bay, numerous canoes pushed off fromthe surrounding shores, and we were soon in the midst of quite aflotilla of them, their savage occupants struggling to get aboardof us, and jostling one another in their ineffectual attempts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally the projecting out-riggers of their slight shallopsrunning foul of one another, would become entangled beneath thewater, threatening to capsize the canoes, when a scene ofconfusion would ensue that baffles description.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such strangeoutcries and passionate gesticulations I never certainly heard orsaw before.&nbsp;&nbsp;You would have thought the islanders were on thepoint of flying at each other's throats, whereas they were onlyamicably engaged in disentangling their boats.</p><p> Scattered here and there among the canoes might be seen numbersof cocoanuts floating closely together in circular groups, andbobbing up and down with every wave.&nbsp;&nbsp;By some inexplicable meansthese cocoanuts were all steadily approaching towards the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I leaned curiously over the side, endeavouring to solve theirmysterious movements, one mass far in advance of the restattracted my attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;In its centre was something I could takefor nothing else than a cocoanut, but which I certainlyconsidered one of the most extraordinary specimens of the fruit Ihad ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;It kept twirling and dancing about among the restin the most singular manner, and as it drew nearer I thought itbore a remarkable resemblance to the brown shaven skull of one ofthe savages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently it betrayed a pair of eyes, and soon Ibecame aware that what I had supposed to have been one of thefruit was nothing else than the head of an islander, who hadadopted this singular method of bringing his produce to market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cocoanuts were all attached to one another by strips of thehusk, partly torn from the shell and rudely fastened together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their proprietor inserting his head into the midst of them,impelled his necklace of cocoanuts through the water by strikingout beneath the surface with his feet.</p><p> I was somewhat astonished to perceive that among the number ofnatives that surrounded us, not a single female was to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time I was ignorant of the fact that by the operation ofthe 'taboo' the use of canoes in all parts of the island isrigorously prohibited to the entire sex, for whom it is deatheven to be seen entering one when hauled on shore; consequently,whenever a Marquesan lady voyages by water, she puts inrequisition the paddles of her own fair body.</p><p> We had approached within a mile and a half perhaps of this footof the bay, when some of the islanders, who by this time hadmanaged to scramble aboard of us at the risk of swamping theircanoes, directed our attention to a singular commotion in thewater ahead of the vessel.&nbsp;&nbsp;At first I imagined it to be producedby a shoal of fish sporting on the surface, but our savagefriends assured us that it was caused by a shoal of 'whinhenies'(young girls), who in this manner were coming off from the shoreto welcome is.&nbsp;&nbsp;As they drew nearer, and I watched the rising andsinking of their forms, and beheld the uplifted right arm bearingabove the water the girdle of tappa, and their long dark hairtrailing beside them as they swam, I almost fancied they could benothing else than so many mermaids--and very like mermaids theybehaved too.</p><p> We were still some distance from the beach, and under slowheadway, when we sailed right into the midst of these swimmingnymphs, and they boarded us at every quarter; many seizing holdof the chain-plates and springing into the chains; others, at theperil of being run over by the vessel in her course, catching atthe bob-stays, and wreathing their slender forms about the ropes,hung suspended in the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them at length succeeded ingetting up the ship's side, where they clung dripping with thebrine and glowing from the bath, their jet-black tressesstreaming over their shoulders, and half enveloping theirotherwise naked forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;There they hung, sparkling with savagevivacity, laughing gaily at one another, and chattering away withinfinite glee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor were they idle the while, for each oneperformed the simple offices of the toilette for the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their luxuriant locks, wound up and twisted into the smallestpossible compass, were freed from the briny element; the wholeperson carefully dried, and from a little round shell that passedfrom hand to hand, anointed with a fragrant oil: their adornmentswere completed by passing a few loose folds of white tappa, in amodest cincture, around the waist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus arrayed they no longerhesitated, but flung themselves lightly over the bulwarks, andwere quickly frolicking about the decks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them wentforward, perching upon the headrails or running out upon thebowsprit, while others seated themselves upon the taffrail, orreclined at full length upon the boats.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a sight for usbachelor sailors!&nbsp;&nbsp;How avoid so dire a temptation?&nbsp;&nbsp;For who couldthink of tumbling these artless creatures overboard, when theyhad swum miles to welcome us?</p><p> Their appearance perfectly amazed me; their extreme youth, thelight clear brown of their complexions, their delicate features,and inexpressibly graceful figures, their softly moulded limbs,and free unstudied action, seemed as strange as beautiful.</p><p> The Dolly was fairly captured; and never I will say was vesselcarried before by such a dashing and irresistible party ofboarders!&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship taken, we could not do otherwise than yieldourselves prisoners, and for the whole period that she remainedin the bay, the Dolly, as well as her crew, were completely inthe hands of the mermaids.</p><p> In the evening after we had come to an anchor the deck wasilluminated with lanterns, and this picturesque band of sylphs,tricked out with flowers, and dressed in robes of variegatedtappa, got up a ball in great style.&nbsp;&nbsp;These females arepassionately fond of dancing, and in the wild grace and spirit ofthe style excel everything I have ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The varied dancesof the Marquesan girls are beautiful in the extreme, but there isan abandoned voluptuousness in their character which I dare notattempt to describe.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Three</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER THREE</p><p> SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LATE

troops.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were employed in constructing works ofdefence, and otherwise providing against the attacks of thenatives, who at any moment might be expected to break out in openhostility.&nbsp;&nbsp;The islanders looked upon the people who made thiscavalier appropriation of their shores with mingled feelings offear and detestation.&nbsp;&nbsp;They cordially hated them; but theimpulses of their resentment were neutralized by their dread ofthe floating batteries, which lay with their fatal tubesostentatiously pointed, not at fortifications and redoubts, butat a handful of bamboo sheds, sheltered in a grove of cocoanuts!&nbsp;&nbsp;A valiant warrior doubtless, but a prudent one too, was this sameRear-Admiral Du Petit Thouars.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four heavy, doublebanked frigatesand three corvettes to frighten a parcel of naked heathen intosubjection!&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty-eight pounders to demolish huts of cocoanutboughs, and Congreve rockets to set on fire a few canoe sheds!</p><p> At Nukuheva, there were about one hundred soldiers ashore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theywere encamped in tents, constructed of the old sails and sparespars of the squadron, within the limits of a redoubt mountedwith a few nine-pounders, and surrounded with a fosse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyother day, these troops were marched out in martial array, to alevel piece of ground in the vicinity, and there for hours wentthrough all sorts of military evolutions, surrounded by flocks ofthe natives, who looked on with savage admiration at the show,and as savage a hatred of the actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;A regiment of the OldGuard, reviewed on a summer's day in the Champs Elysees, couldnot have made a more critically correct appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theofficers' regimentals, resplendent with gold lace and embroideryas if purposely calculated to dazzle the islanders, looked as ifjust unpacked from their Parisian cases.</p><p> The sensation produced by the presence of the strangers had notin the least subsided at the period of our arrival at theislands.&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives still flocked in numbers about theencampment, and watched with the liveliest curiosity everythingthat was going forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;A blacksmith's forge, which had been setup in the shelter of a grove near the beach, attracted so great acrowd, that it required the utmost efforts of the sentries postedaround to keep the inquisitive multitude at a sufficient distanceto allow the workmen to ply their vocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing gainedso large a share of admiration as a horse, which had been broughtfrom Valparaiso by the Achille, one of the vessels of thesquadron.&nbsp;&nbsp;The animal, a remarkably fine one, had been takenashore, and stabled in a hut of cocoanut boughs within thefortified enclosure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally it was brought out, and, beinggaily caparisoned, was ridden by one of the officers at fullspeed over the hard sand beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;This performance was sure to behailed with loud plaudits, and the 'puarkee nuee' (big hog) wasunanimously pronounced by the islanders to be the mostextraordinary specimen of zoology that had ever come under theirobservation.</p><p> The expedition for the occupation of the Marquesas had sailedfrom Brest in the spring of 1842, and the secret of itsdestination was solely in the possession of its commander.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowonder that those who contemplated such a signal infraction ofthe rights of humanity should have sought to veil the enormityfrom the eyes of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, notwithstanding theiriniquitous conduct in this and in other matters, the French haveever plumed themselves upon being the most humane and polished ofnations.&nbsp;&nbsp;A high degree of refinement, however, does not seem tosubdue our wicked propensities so much after all; and werecivilization itself to be estimated by some of its results, itwould seem perhaps better for what we call the barbarous part ofthe world to remain unchanged.</p><p> One example of the shameless subterfuges under which the Frenchstand prepared to defend whatever cruelties they may hereafterthink fit to commit in bringing the Marquesan natives intosubjection is well worthy of being recorded.&nbsp;&nbsp;On some flimsypretext or other Mowanna, the king of Nukuheva, whom the invadersby extravagant presents cajoled over to their interests, and moveabout like a mere puppet, has been set up as the rightfulsovereign of the entire island--the alleged ruler by prescriptionof various clans, who for ages perhaps have treated with eachother as separate nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;To reinstate this much-injured princein the assumed dignities of his ancestors, the disinterestedstrangers have come all the way from France: they are determinedthat his title shall be acknowledged.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any tribe shall refuseto recognize the authority of the French, by bowing down to thelaced chapeau of Mowanna, let them abide the consequences oftheir obstinacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under cover of a similar pretence, have theoutrages and massacres at Tahiti the beautiful, the queen of theSouth Seas, been perpetrated.</p><p> On this buccaneering expedition, Rear Admiral Du Petit Thouars,leaving the rest of his squadron at the Marquesas,--which hadthen been occupied by his forces about five months--set sail forthe doomed island in the Reine Blanche frigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;On his arrival,as an indemnity for alleged insults offered to the flag of hiscountry, he demanded some twenty or thirty thousand dollars to beplaced in his hands forthwith, and in default of payment,threatened to land and take possession of the place.</p><p> The frigate, immediately upon coming to an anchor, got springs onher cables, and with he guns; cast loose and her men at theirquarters, lay in the circular basin of Papeete, with herbroadside bearing upon the devoted town; while her numerouscutters, hauled in order alongside, were ready to effect alanding, under cover of her batteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;She maintained thisbelligerent attitude for several days, during which time a seriesof informal negotiations were pending, and wide alarm spread overthe island.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Tahitians were at first disposed toresort to arms, and drive the invaders from their shores; butmore pacific and feebler counsels ultimately prevailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theunfortunate queen Pomare, incapable of averting the impendingcalamity, terrified at the arrogance of the insolent Frenchman,and driven at last to despair, fled by night in a canoe to Emio.</p><p> During the continuance of the panic there occurred an instance offeminine heroism that I cannot omit to record.</p><p> In the grounds of the famous missionary consul, Pritchard, thenabsent in London, the consular flag of Britain waved as usualduring the day, from a lofty staff planted within a few yards ofthe beach, and in full view of the frigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning anofficer, at the head of a party of men, presented himself at theverandah of Mr Pritchard's house, and inquired in broken Englishfor the lady his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;The matron soon made her appearance; andthe polite Frenchman, making one of his best bows, and playinggracefully with the aiguillettes that danced upon his breast,proceeded in courteous accents to deliver his mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Theadmiral desired the flag to be hauled down--hoped it would beperfectly agreeable--and his men stood ready to perform theduty.'&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tell the Pirate your master,' replied the spiritedEnglishwoman, pointing to the staff, 'that if he wishes to strikethese colours, he must come and perform the act himself; I willsuffer no one else to do it.'&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady then bowed haughtily andwithdrew into the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the discomfited officer slowlywalked away, he looked up to the flag, and perceived that thecord by which it was elevated to its place, led from the top ofthe staff, across the lawn, to an open upper window of themansion, where sat the lady from whom he had just parted,tranquilly engaged in knitting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that flag hauled down?&nbsp;&nbsp;MrsPritchard thinks not; and Rear-Admiral Du Petit Thouars isbelieved to be of the same opinion.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Four</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER FOUR</p><p> STATE OF AFFAIRS ABOARD THE SHIP--CONTENTS OF HER LARDER--LENGTHOF SOUTH SEAMEN'S VOYAGES--ACCOUNT OF A FLYINGWHALE-MAN--DETERMINATION TO LEAVE THE VESSEL--THE BAY OFNUKUHEVA--THE TYPEES--INVASION OF THEIR VALLEY BY PORTER -REFLECTIONS -- GLEN OF TIOR--INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE OLD KING ANDTHE FRENCH ADMIRAL</p><p> OUR ship had not been many days in the harbour of Nukuheva beforeI came to the determination of leaving her.&nbsp;&nbsp;That my reasons forresolving to take this step were numerous and weighty, may beinferred from the fact that I chose rather to risk my fortunesamong the savages of the island than to endure another voyage onboard the Dolly.&nbsp;&nbsp;To use the concise, pointblank phrase of thesailors.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had made up my mind to 'run away'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as a meaningis generally attached to these two words no way flattering to theindividual to whom they are applied, it behoves me, for the sakeof my own character, to offer some explanation of my conduct.</p><p> When I entered on board the Dolly, I signed as a matter of coursethe ship's articles, thereby voluntarily engaging and legallybinding myself to serve in a certain capacity for the period ofthe voyage; and, special considerations apart, I was of coursebound to fulfill the agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in all contracts, if oneparty fail to perform his share of the compact, is not the othervirtually absolved from his liability?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is there who will notanswer in the affirmative?</p><p> Having settled the principle, then, let me apply it to theparticular case in question.&nbsp;&nbsp;In numberless instances had notonly the implied but the specified conditions of the articlesbeen violated on the part of the ship in which I served.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theusage on board of her was tyrannical; the sick had been inhumanlyneglected; the provisions had been doled out in scanty allowance;and her cruises were unreasonably protracted.&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain wasthe author of the abuses; it was in vain to think that he wouldeither remedy them, or alter his conduct, which was arbitrary andviolent in the extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;His prompt reply to all complaints andremonstrances was--the butt-end of a handspike, so convincinglyadministered as effectually to silence the aggrieved party.</p><p> To whom could we apply for redress?&nbsp;&nbsp;We had left both law andequity on the other side of the Cape; and unfortunately, with avery few exceptions, our crew was composed of a parcel ofdastardly and meanspirited wretches, divided among themselves,and only united in enduring without resistance the unmitigatedtyranny of the captain.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been mere madness for anytwo or three of the number, unassisted by the rest, to attemptmaking a stand against his ill usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;They would only havecalled down upon themselves the particular vengeance of this'Lord of the Plank', and subjected their shipmates to additionalhardships.</p><p> But, after all, these things could have been endured awhile, hadwe entertained the hope of being speedily delivered from them bythe due completion of the term of our servitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what adismal prospect awaited us in this quarter!&nbsp;&nbsp;The longevity ofCape Horn whaling voyages is proverbial, frequently extendingover a period of four or five years.</p><p> Some long-haired, bare-necked youths, who, forced by the unitedinfluences of Captain Marryatt and hard times, embark atNantucket for a pleasure excursion to the Pacific, and whoseanxious mothers provide them, with bottled milk for the occasion,oftentimes return very respectable middle-aged gentlemen.</p><p> The very preparations made for one of these expeditions areenough to frighten one.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the vessel carries out no cargo, herhold is filled with provisions for her own consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theowners, who officiate as caterers for the voyage, supply thelarder with an abundance of dainties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Delicate morsels of beefand pork, cut on scientific principles from every part of theanimal, and of all conceivable shapes and sizes, are carefullypacked in salt, and stored away in barrels; affording anever-ending variety in their different degrees of toughness, andin the peculiarities of their saline properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Choice oldwater too, decanted into stout six-barrel-casks, and two pints ofwhich is allowed every day to each soul on board; together withample store of sea-bread, previously reduced to a state ofpetrifaction, with a view to preserve it either from decay orconsumption in the ordinary mode, are likewise provided for thenourishment and gastronomic enjoyment of the crew.</p><p> But not to speak of the quality of these articles of sailors'fare, the abundance in which they are put onboard a whalingvessel is almost incredible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oftentimes, when we had occasion tobreak out in the hold, and I beheld the successive tiers of casksand barrels, whose contents were all destined to be consumed indue course by the ship's company, my heart has sunk within me.</p><p> Although, as a general case, a ship unlucky in falling in withwhales continues to cruise after them until she has barelysufficient provisions remaining to take her home, turning roundthen quietly and making the best of her way to her friends, yetthere are instances when even this natural obstacle to thefurther prosecution of the voyage is overcome by headstrongcaptains, who, bartering the fruits of their hard-earned toilsfor a new supply of provisions in some of the ports of Chili orPeru, begin the voyage afresh with unabated zeal andperseverance.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in vain that the owners write urgent lettersto him to sail for home, and for their sake to bring back theship, since it appears he can put nothing in her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not he.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehas registered a vow: he will fill his vessel with good spermoil, or failing to do so, never again strike Yankee soundings.</p><p> I heard of one whaler, which after many years' absence was givenup for lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last that had been heard of her was a shadowyreport of her having touched at some of those unstable islands inthe far Pacific, whose eccentric wanderings are carefully notedin each new edition of the South-Sea charts.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a longinterval, however, 'The Perseverance'--for that was her name--wasspoken somewhere in the vicinity of the ends of the earth,cruising along as leisurely as ever, her sails all bepatched andbe quilted with rope-yarns, her spars fished with old pipestaves, and her rigging knotted and spliced in every possibledirection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her crew was composed of some twenty venerableGreenwich-pensioner-looking old salts, who just managed to hobbleabout deck.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ends of all the running ropes, with theexception of the signal halyards and poop-down-haul, were rovethrough snatch-blocks,and led to the capstan or windlass, so thatnot a yard was braced or a sad set without the assistance ofmachinery.</p><p> Her hull was encrusted with barnacles, which completely encasedher.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three pet sharks followed in her wake, and every day camealongside to regale themselves from the contents of the cook'sbucket, which were pitched over to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;A vast shoal of bonetasand albicores always kept her company.</p><p> Such was the account I heard of this vessel and the remembranceof it always haunted me; what eventually became of her I neverlearned; at any rate: he never reached home, and I suppose she isstill regularly tacking twice in the twenty-four hours somewhereoff Desolate Island, or the Devil's-Tail Peak.</p><p> Having said thus much touching the usual length of these voyages,when I inform the reader that ours had as it were just commenced,we being only fifteen months out, and even at that time hailed asa late arrival and boarded for news, he will readily perceivethat there was little to encourage one in looking forward to thefuture, especially as I had always had a presentiment that weshould make an unfortunate voyage, and our experience so far hadjustified the expectation.</p><p> I may here state, and on my faith as an honest man, that thoughmore than three years have elapsed since I left this sameidentical vessel, she still continues; in the Pacific, and but afew days since I saw her reported in the papers as having touchedat the Sandwich Islands previous to going on the coast of Japan.</p><p> But to return to my narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Placed in these circumstancesthen, with no prospect of matters mending if I remained aboardthe Dolly, I at once made up my mind to leave her: to be sure itwas rather an inglorious thing to steal away privily from thoseat whose hands I had received wrongs and outrages that I couldnot resent; but how was such a course to be avoided when it wasthe only alternative left me?&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made up my mind, Iproceeded to acquire all the information I could obtain relatingto the island and its inhabitants, with a view of shaping myplans of escape accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of these inquiries Iwill now state, in order that the ensuing narrative may be thebetter understood.</p><p> The bay of Nukuheva in which we were then lying is an expanse ofwater not unlike in figure the space included within the limitsof a horse-shoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, perhaps, nine miles in circumference.&nbsp;&nbsp;You approach it from the sea by a narrow entrance, flanked oneach side by two small twin islets which soar conically to theheight of some five hundred feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;From these the shore recedeson both hands, and describes a deep semicircle.</p><p> From the verge of the water the land rises uniformly on allsides, with green and sloping acclivities, until from gentlyrolling hill-sides and moderate elevations it insensibly swellsinto lofty and majestic heights, whose blue outlines, ranged allaround, close in the view.&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful aspect of the shore isheightened by deep and romantic glens, which come down to it atalmost equal distances, all apparently radiating from a commoncentre, and the upper extremities of which are lost to the eyebeneath the shadow of the mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Down each of these littlevalleys flows a clear stream, here and there assuming the form ofa slender cascade, then stealing invisibly along until it burstsupon the sight again in larger and more noisy waterfalls, and atlast demurely wanders along to the sea.</p><p> The houses of the natives, constructed of the yellow bamboo,tastefully twisted together in a kind of wicker-work, andthatched with the long tapering leaves of the palmetto, arescattered irregularly along these valleys beneath the shadybranches of the cocoanut trees.</p><p> Nothing can exceed the imposing scenery of this bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed fromour ship as she lay at anchor in the middle of the harbour, itpresented the appearance of a vast natural amphitheatre in decay,and overgrown with vines, the deep glens that furrowed it's sidesappearing like enormous fissures caused by the ravages of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often when lost in admiration at its beauty, I haveexperienced a pang of regret that a scene so enchanting should behidden from the world in these remote seas, and seldom meet theeyes of devoted lovers of nature.</p><p> Besides this bay the shores of the island are indented by severalother extensive inlets, into which descend broad and verdantvalleys.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are inhabited by as many distinct tribes ofsavages, who, although speaking kindred dialects of a commonlanguage, and having the same religion and laws, have from timeimmemorial waged hereditary warfare against each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theintervening mountains generally two or three thousand feet abovethe level of the sea geographically define the territories ofeach of these hostile tribes, who never cross them, save on someexpedition of war or plunder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately adjacent to Nukuheva,and only separated from it by the mountains seen from theharbour, lies the lovely valley of Happar, whose inmates cherishthe most friendly relations with the inhabitants of Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;Onthe other side of Happar, and closely adjoining it, is themagnificent valley of the dreaded Typees, the unappeasableenemies of both these tribes.</p><p> These celebrated warriors appear to inspire the other islanderswith unspeakable terrors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their very name is a frightful one;for the word 'Typee' in the Marquesan dialect signifies a loverof human flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather singular that the title should havebeen bestowed upon them exclusively, inasmuch as the natives ofall this group are irreclaimable cannibals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The name may,perhaps, have been given to denote the peculiar ferocity of thisclan, and to convey a special stigma along with it.</p><p> These same Typees enjoy a prodigious notoriety all over theislands.&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives of Nukuheva would frequently recount inpantomime to our ship's company their terrible feats, and wouldshow the marks of wounds they had received in desperateencounters with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;When ashore they would try to frighten usby pointing, to one of their own number, and calling him a Typee,manifesting no little surprise that we did not take to our heelsat so terrible an announcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was quite amusing, too, tosee with what earnestness they disclaimed all cannibalpropensities on their own part, while they denounced theirenemies--the Typees--as inveterate gourmandizers of human flesh;but this is a peculiarity to which I shall hereafter haveoccasion to allude.</p><p> Although I was convinced that the inhabitants of our bay were asarrant cannibals as any of the other tribes on the island, stillI could not but feel a particular and most unqualified repugnanceto the aforesaid Typees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before visiting the Marquesas, Ihad heard from men who had touched at the group on former voyagessome revolting stories in connection with these savages; andfresh in my remembrance was the adventure of the master of theKatherine, who only a few months previous, imprudently venturinginto this bay in an armed boat for the purpose of barter, wasseized by the natives, carried back a little distance into theirvalley, and was only saved from a cruel death by the interventionof a young girl, who facilitated his escape by night along thebeach to Nukuheva.</p><p> I had heard too of an English vessel that many years ago, after aweary cruise, sought to enter the bay of Nukuheva, and arrivingwithin two or three miles of the land, was met by a large canoefilled with natives, who offered to lead the way to the place oftheir destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain, unacquainted with the localitiesof the island, joyfully acceded to the proposition--the canoepaddled on, the ship followed.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was soon conducted to abeautiful inlet, and dropped her anchor in its waters beneath theshadows of the lofty shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;That same night the perfidiousTypees, who had thus inveigled her into their fatal bay, flockedaboard the doomed vessel by hundreds, and at a given signalmurdered every soul on board.</p><p> I shall never forget the observation of one of our crew as wewere passing slowly by the entrance of the bay in our way toNukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we stood gazing over the side at the verdantheadlands, Ned, pointing with his hand in the direction of thetreacherous valley, exclaimed, 'There--there's Typee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, thebloody cannibals, what a meal they'd make of us if we were totake it into our heads to land!&nbsp;&nbsp;but they say they don't likesailor's flesh, it's too salt.&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, maty, how should you liketo be shoved ashore there, eh?'&nbsp;&nbsp;I little thought, as I shudderedat the question, that in the space of a few weeks I shouldactually be a captive in that self-same valley.</p><p> The French, although they had gone through the ceremony ofhoisting their colours for a few hours at all the principalplaces of the group, had not as yet visited the bay of Typee,anticipating a fierce resistance on the part of the savagesthere, which for the present at least they wished to avoid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps they were not a little influenced in the adoption of thisunusual policy from a recollection of the warlike reception givenby the Typees to the forces of Captain Porter, about the year1814, when that brave and accomplished officer endeavoured tosubjugate the clan merely to gratify the mortal hatred of hisallies the Nukuhevas and Happars.</p><p> On that occasion I have been told that a considerable detachmentof sailors and marines from the frigate Essex, accompanied by atleast two thousand warriors of Happar and Nukuheva, landed inboats and canoes at the head of the bay, and after penetrating alittle distance into the valley, met with the stoutest resistancefrom its inmates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Valiantly, although with much loss, the Typeesdisputed every inch of ground, and after some hard fightingobliged their assailants to retreat and abandon their design ofconquest.</p><p> The invaders, on their march back to the sea, consoled themselvesfor their repulse by setting fire to every house and temple intheir route; and a long line of smoking ruins defaced theonce-smiling bosom of the valley, and proclaimed to its paganinhabitants the spirit that reigned in the breasts of Christiansoldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can wonder at the deadly hatred of the Typees toall foreigners after such unprovoked atrocities?</p><p> Thus it is that they whom we denominate 'savages' are made todeserve the title.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the inhabitants of some sequesteredisland first descry the 'big canoe' of the European rollingthrough the blue waters towards their shores, they rush down tothe beach in crowds, and with open arms stand ready to embracethe strangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatal embrace!&nbsp;&nbsp;They fold to their bosom thevipers whose sting is destined to poison all their joys; and theinstinctive feeling of love within their breast is soon convertedinto the bitterest hate.</p><p> The enormities perpetrated in the South Seas upon some of theinoffensive islanders will nigh pass belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;These things areseldom proclaimed at home; they happen at the very ends of theearth; they are done in a corner, and there are none to revealthem.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is, nevertheless, many a petty trader that hasnavigated the Pacific whose course from island to island might betraced by a series of cold-blooded robberies, kidnappings, andmurders, the iniquity of which might be considered almostsufficient to sink her guilty timbers to the bottom of the sea.</p><p> Sometimes vague accounts of such thing's reach our firesides, andwe coolly censure them as wrong, impolitic, needlessly severe,and dangerous to the crews of other vessels.&nbsp;&nbsp;How different isour tone when we read the highly-wrought description of themassacre of the crew of the Hobomak by the Feejees; how wesympathize for the unhappy victims, and with what horror do weregard the diabolical heathens, who, after all, have but avengedthe unprovoked injuries which they have received.&nbsp;&nbsp;We breathenothing but vengeance, and equip armed vessels to traversethousands of miles of ocean in order to execute summarypunishment upon the offenders.&nbsp;&nbsp;On arriving at their destination,they burn, slaughter, and destroy, according to the tenor ofwritten instructions, and sailing away from the scene ofdevastation, call upon all Christendom to applaud their courageand their justice.</p><p> How often is the term 'savages' incorrectly applied!&nbsp;&nbsp;None reallydeserving of it were ever yet discovered by voyagers or bytravellers.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have discovered heathens and barbarians whom byhorrible cruelties they have exasperated into savages.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may beasserted without fear of contradictions that in all the cases ofoutrages committed by Polynesians, Europeans have at some time orother been the aggressors, and that the cruel and bloodthirstydisposition of some of the islanders is mainly to be ascribed tothe influence of such examples.</p><p> But to return.&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the mutual hostilities of the differenttribes I have mentioned, the mountainous tracts which separatetheir respective territories remain altogether uninhabited; thenatives invariably dwelling in the depths of the valleys, with aview of securing themselves from the predatory incursions oftheir enemies, who often lurk along their borders, ready to cutoff any imprudent straggler, or make a descent upon the inmatesof some sequestered habitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I several times met with veryaged men, who from this cause had never passed the confines oftheir native vale, some of them having never even ascended midwayup the mountains in the whole course of their lives, and who,accordingly had little idea of the appearance of any other partof the island, the whole of which is not perhaps more than sixtymiles in circuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The little space in which some of these clanspass away their days would seem almost incredible.</p><p> The glen of the Tior will furnish a curious illustration of this.</p><p> The inhabited part is not more than four miles in length, andvaries in breadth from half a mile to less than a quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therocky vine-clad cliffs on one side tower almost perpendicularlyfrom their base to the height of at least fifteen hundred feet;while across the vale--in striking contrast to the sceneryopposite--grass-grown elevations rise one above another inblooming terraces.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hemmed in by these stupendous barriers, thevalley would be altogether shut out from the rest of the world,were it not that it is accessible from the sea at one end, and bya narrow defile at the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> The impression produced upon the mind, when I first visited thisbeautiful glen, will never be obliterated.</p><p> I had come from Nukuheva by water in the ship's boat, and when weentered the bay of Tior it was high noon.&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat had beenintense, as we had been floating upon the long smooth swell ofthe ocean, for there was but little wind.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun's rays hadexpended all their fury upon us; and to add to our discomfort, wehad omitted to supply ourselves with water previous to starting.&nbsp;&nbsp;What with heat and thirst together, I became so impatient to getashore, that when at last we glided towards it, I stood up in thebow of the boat ready for a spring.&nbsp;&nbsp;As she shot two-thirds ofher length high upon the beach, propelled by three or four strongstrokes of the oars, I leaped among a parcel of juvenile savages,who stood prepared to give us a kind reception; and with them atmy heels, yelling like so many imps, I rushed forward across theopen ground in the vicinity of the sea, and plunged, diverfashion, into the recesses of the first grove that offered.</p><p> What a delightful sensation did I experience!&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt as iffloating in some new element, while all sort of gurgling,trickling, liquid sounds fell upon my ear.&nbsp;&nbsp;People may say whatthey will about the refreshing influences of a coldwater bath,but commend me when in a perspiration to the shade baths of Tior,beneath the cocoanut trees, and amidst the cool delightfulatmosphere which surrounds them.</p><p> How shall I describe the scenery that met my eye, as I looked outfrom this verdant recess!&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow valley, with its steep andclose adjoining sides draperied with vines, and arched overheadwith a fret-work of interlacing boughs, nearly hidden from viewby masses of leafy verdure, seemed from where I stood like animmense arbour disclosing its vista to the eye, whilst as Iadvanced it insensibly widened into the loveliest vale eye everbeheld.</p><p> It so happened that the very day I was in Tior the Frenchadmiral, attended by all the boats of his squadron, came down instate from Nukuheva to take formal possession of the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heremained in the valley about two hours, during which time he hada ceremonious interview with the king.&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch-sovereignof Tior was a man very far advanced in years; but though age hadbowed his form and rendered him almost decrepid, his giganticframe retained its original magnitude and grandeur of appearance.</p><p> He advanced slowly and with evident pain, assisting his totteringsteps with the heavy warspear he held in his hand, and attendedby a group of grey-bearded chiefs, on one of whom he occasionallyleaned for support.&nbsp;&nbsp;The admiral came forward with head uncoveredand extended hand, while the old king saluted him by a statelyflourish of his weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment they stood side by side,these two extremes of the social scale,--the polished, splendidFrenchman, and the poor tattooed savage.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were both tall andnoble-looking men; but in other respects how strikinglycontrasted!&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Petit Thouars exhibited upon his person all theparaphernalia of his naval rank.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a richly decoratedadmiral's frock-coat, a laced chapeau bras, and upon his breastwere a variety of ribbons and orders; while the simple islander,with the exception of a slight cincture about his loins, appearedin all the nakedness of nature.</p><p> At what an immeasurable distance, thought I, are these two beingsremoved from each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the one is shown the result of longcenturies of progressive Civilization and refinement, which havegradually converted the mere creature into the semblance of allthat is elevated and grand; while the other, after the lapse ofthe same period, has not advanced one step in the career ofimprovement, 'Yet, after all,' quoth I to myself, 'insensible ashe is to a thousand wants, and removed from harassing cares, maynot the savage be the happier man of the two?'&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were thethoughts that arose in my mind as I gazed upon the novelspectacle before me.&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth it was an impressive one, andlittle likely to be effaced.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can recall even now with vividdistinctiness every feature of the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;The umbrageous shadeswhere the interview took place--the glorious tropical vegetationaround--the picturesque grouping of the mingled throng ofsoldiery and natives--and even the golden-hued bunch of bananasthat I held in my hand at the time, and of which I occasionallypartook while making the aforesaid philosophical reflections.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Five</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER FIVE</p><p> THOUGHTS PREVIOUS TO ATTEMPTING AN ESCAPE--TOBY, A FELLOW SAILOR,AGREES TO SHARE THE ADVENTURE--LAST NIGHT ABOARD THE SHIP</p><p> HAVING fully resolved to leave the vessel clandestinely, andhaving acquired all the knowledge concerning the bay that I couldobtain under the circumstances in which I was placed, I nowdeliberately turned over in my mind every plan to escape thatsuggested itself, being determined to act with all possibleprudence in an attempt where failure would be attended with somany disagreeable consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of being taken andbrought back ignominiously to the ship was so inexpressiblyrepulsive to me, that I was determined by no hasty and imprudentmeasures to render such an event probable.</p><p> I knew that our worthy captain, who felt, such a paternalsolicitude for the welfare of his crew, would not willinglyconsent that one of his best hands should encounter the perils ofa sojourn among the natives of a barbarous island; and I wascertain that in the event of my disappearance, his fatherlyanxiety would prompt him to offer, by way of a reward, yard uponyard of gaily printed calico for my apprehension.&nbsp;&nbsp;He might evenhave appreciated my services at the value of a musket, in whichcase I felt perfectly certain that the whole population of thebay would be immediately upon my track, incited by the prospectof so magnificent a bounty.</p><p> Having ascertained the fact before alluded to, that theislanders,--from motives of precaution, dwelt altogether in thedepths of the valleys, and avoided wandering about the moreelevated portions of the shore, unless bound on some expeditionof war or plunder, I concluded that if I could effect unperceiveda passage to the mountain, I might easily remain among them,supporting myself by such fruits as came in my way until thesailing of the ship, an event of which I could not fail to beimmediately apprised, as from my lofty position I should commanda view of the entire harbour.</p><p> The idea pleased me greatly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to combine a great dealof practicability with no inconsiderable enjoyment in a quietway; for how delightful it would be to look down upon thedetested old vessel from the height of some thousand feet, andcontrast the verdant scenery about me with the recollection ofher narrow decks and gloomy forecastle!&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, it was reallyrefreshing even to think of it; and so I straightway fell topicturing myself seated beneath a cocoanut tree on the brow ofthe mountain, with a cluster of plantains within easy reach,criticizing her nautical evolutions as she was working her wayout of the harbour.</p><p> To be sure there was one rather unpleasant drawback to theseagreeable anticipations--the possibility of falling in with aforaging party of these same bloody-minded Typees, whoseappetites, edged perhaps by the air of so elevated a region,might prompt them to devour one.&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I must confess, was amost disagreeable view of the matter.</p><p> Just to think of a party of these unnatural gourmands taking itinto their heads to make a convivial meal of a poor devil, whowould have no means of escape or defence: however, there was nohelp for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was willing to encounter some risks in order toaccomplish my object, and counted much upon my ability to eludethese prowling cannibals amongst the many coverts which themountains afforded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the chances were ten to one in myfavour that they would none of them quit their own fastnesses.</p><p> I had determined not to communicate my design of withdrawing fromthe vessel to any of my shipmates, and least of all to solicitany one to accompany me in my flight.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it so happened onenight, that being upon deck, revolving over in my mind variousplans of escape, I perceived one of the ship's company leaningover the bulwarks, apparently plunged in a profound reverie.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hewas a young fellow about my own age, for whom I had all alongentertained a great regard; and Toby, such was the name by whichhe went among us, for his real name he would never tell us, wasevery way worthy of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was active, ready and obliging, ofdauntless courage, and singularly open and fearless in theexpression of his feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had on more than one occasion gothim out of scrapes into which this had led him; and I know notwhether it was from this cause, or a certain congeniality ofsentiment between us, that he had always shown a partiality formy society.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had battled out many a long watch together,beguiling the weary hours with chat, song, and story, mingledwith a good many imprecations upon the hard destiny it seemed ourcommon fortune to encounter.</p><p> Toby, like myself, had evidently moved in a different sphere oflife, and his conversation at times betrayed this, although hewas anxious to conceal it.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was one of that class of roversyou sometimes meet at sea, who never reveal their origin, neverallude to home, and go rambling over the world as if pursued bysome mysterious fate they cannot possibly elude.</p><p> There was much even in the appearance of Toby calculated to drawme towards him, for while the greater part of the crew were ascoarse in person as in mind, Toby was endowed with a remarkablyprepossessing exterior.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrayed in his blue frock and ducktrousers, he was as smart a looking sailor as ever stepped upon adeck; he was singularly small and slightly made, with greatflexibility of limb.&nbsp;&nbsp;His naturally dark complexion had beendeepened by exposure to the tropical sun, and a mass of jettylocks clustered about his temples, and threw a darker shade intohis large black eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a strange wayward being, moody,fitful, and melancholy--at times almost morose.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a quickand fiery temper too, which, when thoroughly roused, transportedhim into a state bordering on delirium.</p><p> It is strange the power that a mind of deep passion has overfeebler natures.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen a brawny, fellow, with no lack ofordinary courage, fairly quail before this slender stripling,when in one of his curious fits.&nbsp;&nbsp;But these paroxysms seldomoccurred, and in them my big-hearted shipmate vented the bilewhich more calm-tempered individuals get rid of by a continualpettishness at trivial annoyances.</p><p> No one ever saw Toby laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean in the hearty abandonment ofbroad-mouthed mirth.&nbsp;&nbsp;He did smile sometimes, it is true; andthere was a good deal of dry, sarcastic humour about him, whichtold the more from the imperturbable gravity of his tone andmanner.</p><p> Latterly I had observed that Toby's melancholy had greatlyincreased, and I had frequently seen him since our arrival at theisland gazing wistfully upon the shore, when the remainder of thecrew would be rioting below.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was aware that he entertained acordial detestation of the ship, and believed that, should a fairchance of escape present itself, he would embrace it willingly.</p><p> But the attempt was so perilous in the place where we then lay,that I supposed myself the only individual on board the ship whowas sufficiently reckless to think of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, however, Iwas mistaken.</p><p> When I perceived Toby leaning, as I have mentioned, against thebulwarks and buried in thought, it struck me at once that thesubject of his meditations might be the same as my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;And ifit be so, thought I, is he not the very one of all my shipmateswhom I would choose: for the partner of my adventure?&nbsp;&nbsp;and whyshould I not have some comrade with me to divide its dangers andalleviate its hardships?&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I might be obliged to lieconcealed among the mountains for weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an event what asolace would a companion be?</p><p> These thoughts passed rapidly through my mind, and I wondered whyI had not before considered the matter in this light.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it wasnot too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;A tap upon the shoulder served to rouse Toby fromhis reverie; I found him ripe for the enterprise, and a very fewwords sufficed for a mutual understanding between us.&nbsp;&nbsp;In anhour's time we had arranged all the preliminaries, and decidedupon our plan of action.&nbsp;&nbsp;We then ratified our engagement with anaffectionate wedding of palms, and to elude suspicion repairedeach to his hammock, to spend the last night on board the Dolly.</p><p> The next day the starboard watch, to which we both belonged, wasto be sent ashore on liberty; and, availing ourselves of thisopportunity, we determined, as soon after landing as possible, toseparate ourselves from the rest of the men without excitingtheir suspicions, and strike back at once for the mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen from the ship, their summits appeared inaccessible, but hereand there sloping spurs extended from them almost into the sea,buttressing the lofty elevations with which they were connected,and forming those radiating valleys I have before described.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oneof these ridges, which appeared more practicable than the rest,we determined to climb, convinced that it would conduct us to theheights beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, we carefully observed its bearingsand locality from the ship, so that when ashore we should run nochance of missing it.</p><p> In all this the leading object we had in view was to secludeourselves from sight until the departure of the vessel; then totake our chance as to the reception the Nukuheva natives mightgive us; and after remaining upon the island as long as we foundour stay agreeable, to leave it the first favourable opportunitythat offered.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Six</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER SIX</p><p> A SPECIMEN OF NAUTICAL ORATORY--CRITICISMS OF THE SAILORS--THESTARBOARD WATCH ARE GIVEN A HOLIDAY--THE ESCAPE TO THE MOUNTAINS</p><p> EARLY the next morning the starboard watch were mustered upon thequarter-deck, and our worthy captain, standing in the cabingangway, harangued us as follows:--</p><p> 'Now, men, as we are just off a six months' cruise, and have gotthrough most all our work in port here, I suppose you want to goashore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I mean to give your watch liberty today, so youmay get ready as soon all you please, and go; but understandthis, I am going to give you liberty because I suppose you wouldgrowl like so many old quarter gunners if I didn't; at the sametime, if you'll take my advice, every mother's son of you willstay aboard and keep out of the way of the bloody cannibalsaltogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten to one, men, if you go ashore, you will get intosome infernal row, and that will be the end of you; for if thosetattooed scoundrels get you a little ways back into theirvalleys, they'll nab you--that you may be certain of.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty ofwhite men have gone ashore here and never been seen any more.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the old Dido, she put in here about two years ago, andsent one watch off on liberty; they never were heard of again fora week--the natives swore they didn't know where they were--andonly three of them ever got back to the ship again, and one withhis face damaged for life, for the cursed heathens tattooed abroad patch clean across his figure-head.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will be no usetalking to you, for go you will, that I see plainly; so all Ihave to say is, that you need not blame me if the islanders makea meal of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may stand some chance of escaping themthough, if you keep close about the French encampment,--and areback to the ship again before sunset.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep that much in yourmind, if you forget all the rest I've been saying to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;There,go forward: bear a hand and rig yourselves, and stand by for acall.&nbsp;&nbsp;At two bells the boat will be manned to take you off, andthe Lord have mercy on you!'</p><p> Various were the emotions depicted upon the countenances of thestarboard watch whilst listening to this address; but on itsconclusion there was a general move towards the forecastle, andwe soon were all busily engaged in getting ready for the holidayso auspiciously announced by the skipper.&nbsp;&nbsp;During thesepreparations his harangue was commented upon in no very measuredterms; and one of the party, after denouncing him as a lying oldson of a seacook who begrudged a fellow a few hours' liberty,exclaimed with an oath, 'But you don't bounce me out of myliberty, old chap, for all your yarns; for I would go ashore ifevery pebble on the beach was a live coal, and every stick agridiron, and the cannibals stood ready to broil me on landing.'</p><p> The spirit of this sentiment was responded to by all hands, andwe resolved that in spite of the captain's croakings we wouldmake a glorious day of it.</p><p> But Toby and I had our own game to play, and we availed ourselvesof the confusion which always reigns among a ship's companypreparatory to going ashore, to confer together and complete ourarrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;As our object was to effect as rapid a flight aspossible to the mountains, we determined not to encumberourselves with any superfluous apparel; and accordingly, whilethe rest were rigging themselves out with some idea of making adisplay, we were content to put on new stout duck trousers,serviceable pumps, and heavy Havre-frocks, which with a Payta hatcompleted our equipment.</p><p> When our shipmates wondered at this, Toby exclaimed in his oddgrave way that the rest might do, as they liked, but that he forone preserved his go-ashore traps for the Spanish main, where thetie of a sailor's neckerchief might make some difference; but asfor a parcel of unbreeched heathen, he wouldn't go to the bottomof his chest for any of them, and was half disposed to appearamong them in buff himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;The men laughed at what they thoughtwas one of his strange conceits, and so we escaped suspicion.</p><p> It may appear singular that we should have been thus on our guardwith our own shipmates; but there were some among us who, hadthey possessed the least inkling of our project, would, for apaltry hope of reward, have immediately communicated it to thecaptain.</p><p> As soon as two bells were struck, the word was passed for theliberty-men to get into the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;I lingered behind in theforecastle a moment to take a parting glance at its familiarfeatures, and just as I was about to ascend to the deck my eyehappened to light on the bread-barge and beef-kid, whichcontained the remnants of our last hasty meal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I hadnever before thought of providing anything in the way of food forour expedition, as I fully relied upon the fruits of the islandto sustain us wherever we might wander, yet I could not resistthe inclination I felt to provide luncheon from the relics beforeme.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly I took a double handful of those small, broken,flinty bits of biscuit which generally go by the name of'midshipmen's nuts', and thrust them into the bosom of my frockin which same simple receptacle I had previously stowed awayseveral pounds of tobacco and a few yards of cottoncloth--articles with which I intended to purchase the good-willof the natives, as soon as we should appear among them after thedeparture of our vessel.</p><p> This last addition to my stock caused a considerable protuberancein front, which I abated in a measure by shaking the bits ofbread around my waist, and distributing the plugs of tobaccoamong the folds of the garment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly had I completed thesearrangements when my name was sung out by a dozen voices, and Isprung upon the deck, where I found all the party in the boat,and impatient to shove off.&nbsp;&nbsp;I dropped over the side and seatedmyself with the rest of the watch in the stem sheets, while thepoor larboarders shipped their oars, and commenced pulling usashore.&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened to be the rainy season at the islands, andthe heavens had nearly the whole morning betokened one of thoseheavy showers which during this period so frequently occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thelarge drops fell bubbling into the water shortly after ourleaving the ship, and by the time we had affected a landing itpoured down in torrents.&nbsp;&nbsp;We fled for shelter under cover of animmense canoe-house which stood hard by the beach, and waited forthe first fury of the storm to pass.</p><p> It continued, however, without cessation; and the monotonousbeating of the rain over head began to exert a drowsy influenceupon the men, who, throwing themselves here and there upon thelarge war-canoes, after chatting awhile, all fell asleep.</p><p> This was the opportunity we desired, and Toby and I availedourselves of it at once by stealing out of the canoe-house andplunging into the depths of an extensive grove that was in itsrear.&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes' rapid progress we gained an open spacefrom which we could just descry the ridge we intended to mountlooming dimly through the mists of the tropical shower, anddistant from us, as we estimated, something more than a mile.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our direct course towards it lay through a rather populous partof the bay; but desirous as we were of evading the natives andsecuring an unmolested retreat to the mountains, we determined,by taking a circuit through some extensive thickets, to avoidtheir vicinity altogether.</p><p> The heavy rain that still continued to fall without intermissionfavoured our enterprise, as it drove the islanders into theirhouses, and prevented any casual meeting with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our heavyfrocks soon became completely saturated with water, and by theirweight, and that of the articles we had concealed beneath them,not a little impeded our progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was no time to pausewhen at any moment we might be surprised by a body of thesavages, and forced at the very outset to relinquish ourundertaking.</p><p> Since leaving the canoe-house we had scarcely exchanged a singlesyllable with one another; but when we entered a second narrowopening in the wood, and again caught sight of the ridge beforeus, I took Toby by the arm, and pointing along its slopingoutline to the lofty heights at its extremity, said in a lowtone, 'Now, Toby, not a word, nor a glance backward, till westand on the summit of yonder mountain--so no more lingering butlet us shove ahead while we can, and in a few hours' time we maylaugh aloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the lightest and.the nimblest, so lead on,and I will follow.'</p><p> 'All right, brother,' said Toby, 'quick's our play; only letskeep close together, that's all;' and so saying with a bound likea young roe, he cleared a brook which ran across our path, andrushed forward with a quick step.</p><p> When we arrived within a short distance of the ridge, we werestopped by a mass of tall yellow reeds, growing together asthickly as they could stand, and as tough and stubborn as so manyrods of steel; and we perceived, to our chagrin, that theyextended midway up the elevation we proposed to ascend.</p><p> For a moment we gazed about us in quest of a more practicableroute; it was, however, at once apparent that there was noresource but to pierce this thicket of canes at all hazards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenow reversed our order of march, I, being the heaviest, takingthe lead, with a view of breaking a path through the obstruction,while Toby fell into the rear.</p><p> Two or three times I endeavoured to insinuate myself between thecanes, and by dint of coaxing and bending them to make someprogress; but a bull-frog might as well have tried to work apassage through the teeth of a comb, and I gave up the attempt indespair.</p><p> Half wild with meeting an obstacle we had so little anticipated,I threw myself desperately against it, crushing to the ground thecanes with which I came in contact, and, rising to my feet again,repeated the action with like effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty minutes of thisviolent exercise almost exhausted me, but it carried us some wayinto the thicket; when Toby, who had been reaping the benefit ofmy labours by following close at my heels, proposed to becomepioneer in turn, and accordingly passed ahead with a view ofaffording me a respite from my exertions.&nbsp;&nbsp;As however with hisslight frame he made but bad work of it, I was soon obliged toresume my old place again.&nbsp;&nbsp;On we toiled, the perspirationstarting from our bodies in floods, our limbs torn and laceratedwith the splintered fragments of the broken canes, until we hadproceeded perhaps as far as the middle of the brake, whensuddenly it ceased raining, and the atmosphere around us becameclose and sultry beyond expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;The elasticity of the reedsquickly recovering from the temporary pressure of our bodies,caused them to spring back to their original position; so thatthey closed in upon us as we advanced, and prevented thecirculation of little air which might otherwise have reached us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this, their great height completely shut us out from theview of surrounding objects, and we were not certain but that wemight have been going all the time in a wrong direction.</p><p> Fatigued with my long-continued efforts, and panting for breath,I felt myself completely incapacitated for any further exertion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I rolled up the sleeve of my frock, and squeezed the moisture itcontained into my parched mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the few drops I managed toobtain gave me little relief, and I sank down for a moment with asort of dogged apathy, from which I was aroused by Toby, who haddevised a plan to free us from the net in which we had becomeentangled.</p><p> He was laying about him lustily with his sheath-knive, loppingthe canes right and left, like a reaper, and soon made quite aclearing around us.&nbsp;&nbsp;This sight reanimated me; and seizing my ownknife, I hacked and hewed away without mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp;But alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;thefarther we advanced the thicker and taller, and apparently themore interminable, the reeds became.</p><p> I began to think we were fairly snared, and had almost made up mymind that without a pair of wings we should never be able toescape from the toils; when all at once I discerned a peep ofdaylight through the canes on my right, and, communicating thejoyful tidings to Toby, we both fell to with fresh spirit, andspeedily opening the passage towards it we found ourselves clearof perplexities, and in the near vicinity of the ridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterresting for a few moments we began the ascent, and after a littlevigorous climbing found ourselves close to its summit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Insteadhowever of walking along its ridge, where we should have been infull view of the natives in the vales beneath, and at a pointwhere they could easily intercept us were they so inclined, wecautiously advanced on one side, crawling on our hands and knees,and screened from observation by the grass through which weglided, much in the fashion of a couple of serpents.&nbsp;&nbsp;After anhour employed in this unpleasant kind of locomotion, we startedto our feet again and pursued our way boldly along the crest ofthe ridge.</p><p> This salient spur of the lofty elevations that encompassed thebay rose with a sharp angle from the valleys at its base, andpresented, with the exception of a few steep acclivities, theappearance of a vast inclined plane, sweeping down towards thesea from the heights in the distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had ascended it nearthe place of its termination and at its lowest point, and now sawour route to the mountains distinctly defined along its narrowcrest, which was covered with a soft carpet of verdure, and wasin many parts only a few feet wide.</p><p> Elated with the success which had so far attended our enterprise,and invigorated by the refreshing atmosphere we now inhaled, Tobyand I in high spirits were making our way rapidly along theridge, when suddenly from the valleys below which lay on eitherside of us we heard the distant shouts of the natives, who hadjust descried us, and to whom our figures, brought in bold reliefagainst the sky, were plainly revealed.</p><p> Glancing our eyes into these valleys, we perceived their savageinhabitants hurrying to and fro, seemingly under the influence ofsome sudden alarm, and appearing to the eye scarcely bigger thanso many pigmies; while their white thatched dwellings, dwarfed bythe distance, looked like baby-houses.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we looked down uponthe islanders from our lofty elevation, we experienced a sense ofsecurity; feeling confident that, should they undertake apursuit, it would, from the start we now had, prove entirelyfruitless, unless they followed us into the mountains, where weknew they cared not to venture.</p><p> However, we thought it as well to make the most of our time; andaccordingly, where the ground would admit of it, we ran swiftlyalong the summit of the ridge, until we were brought to a standby a steep cliff, which at first seemed to interpose an effectualbarrier to our farther advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;By dint of much hard scramblinghowever, and at some risk to our necks, we at last surmounted it,and continued our fight with unabated celerity.</p><p> We had left the beach early in the morning, and after anuninterrupted, though at times difficult and dangerous ascent,during which we had never once turned our faces to the sea, wefound ourselves, about three hours before sunset, standing on thetop of what seemed to be the highest land on the island, animmense overhanging cliff composed of basaltic rocks, hung roundwith parasitical plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have been more than threethousand feet above the level of the sea, and the scenery viewedfrom this height was magnificent.</p><p> The lonely bay of Nukuheva, dotted here and there with the blackhulls of the vessels composing the French squadron, lay reposingat the base of a circular range of elevations, whose verdantsides, perforated with deep glens or diversified with smilingvalleys, formed altogether the loveliest view I ever beheld, andwere I to live a hundred years, I shall never forget the feelingof admiration which I then experienced.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Seven</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p> THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN--DISAPPOINTMENT--INVENTORY OFARTICLES BROUGHT FROM THE SHIP--DIVISION OF THE STOCK OFBREAD--APPEARANCE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE ISLAND--A DISCOVERY--ARAVINE AND WATERFALLS--A SLEEPLESS NIGHT--FURTHER DISCOVERIES--MYILLNESS--A MARQUESAN LANDSCAPE</p><p> MY curiosity had been not a little raised with regard to thedescription of country we should meet on the other side of themountains; and I had supposed, with Toby, that immediately ongaining the heights we should be enabled to view the large baysof Happar and Typee reposing at our feet on one side, in the sameway that Nukuheva lay spread out below on the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;But here wewere disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of finding the mountain we hadascended sweeping down in the opposite direction into broad andcapacious valleys, the land appeared to retain its generalelevation, only broken into a series of ridges and inter-valeswhich so far as the eye could reach stretched away from us, withtheir precipitous sides covered with the brightest verdure, andwaving here and there with the foliage of clumps of woodland;among which, however, we perceived none of those trees upon whosefruit we had relied with such certainty.</p><p> This was a most unlooked-for discovery, and one that promised todefeat our plans altogether, for we could not think of descendingthe mountain on the Nukuheva side in quest of food.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should wefor this purpose be induced to retrace our steps, we should runno small chance of encountering the natives, who in that case, ifthey did nothing worse to us, would be certain to convey us backto the ship for the sake of the reward in calico and trinkets,which we had no doubt our skipper would hold out to them as aninducement to our capture.</p><p> What was to be done?&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dolly would not sail perhaps for tendays, and how were we to sustain life during this period?&nbsp;&nbsp;Ibitterly repented our improvidence in not providing ourselves, aswe easily might have done, with a supply of biscuits.&nbsp;&nbsp;With arueful visage I now bethought me of the scanty handful of bread Ihad stuffed into the bosom of my frock, and felt somewhatdesirous to ascertain what part of it had weathered the ratherrough usage it had experienced in ascending the mountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iaccordingly proposed to Toby that we should enter into a jointexamination of the various articles we had brought from the ship.</p><p> With this intent we seated ourselves upon the grass; and a littlecurious to see with what kind of judgement my companion hadfilled his frock--which I remarked seemed about as well lined asmy own--I requested him to commence operations by spreading outits contents.</p><p> Thrusting his hand, then, into the bosom of this capaciousreceptacle, he first brought to light about a pound of tobacco,whose component parts still adhered together, the whole outsidebeing covered with soft particles of sea-bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet anddripping, it had the appearance of having been just recoveredfrom the bottom of the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I paid slight attention to asubstance of so little value to us in our present situation, assoon as I perceived the indications it gave of Toby's foresightin laying in a supply of food for the expedition.</p><p> I eagerly inquired what quantity he had brought with him, whenrummaging once more beneath his garment, he produced a smallhandful of something so soft, pulpy, and discoloured, that for afew moments he was as much puzzled as myself to tell by whatpossible instrumentality such a villainous compound had becomeengendered in his bosom.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only describe it as a hash ofsoaked bread and bits of tobacco, brought to a doughy consistencyby the united agency of perspiration and rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;But repulsive asit might otherwise have been, I now regarded it as an invaluabletreasure, and proceeded with great care to transfer thispaste-like mass to a large leaf which I had plucked from a bushbeside me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby informed me that in the morning he had placedtwo whole biscuits in his bosom, with a view of munching them,should he feel so inclined, during our flight.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were nowreduced to the equivocal substance which I had just placed on theleaf.</p><p> Another dive into the frock brought to view some four or fiveyards of calico print, whose tasteful pattern was ratherdisfigured by the yellow stains of the tobacco with which it hadbeen brought in contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing this calico slowly from hisbosom inch by inch, Toby reminded me of a juggler performing thefeat of the endless ribbon.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next cast was a small one, beinga sailor's little 'ditty bag', containing needles, thread, andother sewing utensils, then came a razor-case, followed by two orthree separate plugs of negro-head, which were fished up from thebottom of the now empty receptacle.&nbsp;&nbsp;These various matters, beinginspected, I produced the few things which I had myself brought.</p><p> As might have been anticipated from the state of my companion'sedible supplies, I found my own in a deplorable condition, anddiminished to a quantity that would not have formed half a dozenmouthfuls for a hungry man who was partial enough to tobacco notto mind swallowing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few morsels of bread, with a fathom ortwo of white cotton cloth, and several pounds of choice pigtail,composed the extent of my possessions.</p><p> Our joint stock of miscellaneous articles were now made up into acompact bundle, which it was agreed we should carry alternately.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sorry remains of the biscuit were not to be disposed ofso summarily: the precarious circumstances in which we wereplaced made us regard them as something on which very probably,depended the fate of our adventure.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief discussion, inwhich we both of us expressed our resolution of not descendinginto the bay until the ship's departure, I suggested to mycompanion that little of it as there was, we should divide thebread into six equal portions, each of which should be a day'sallowance for both of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposition he assented to; so Itook the silk kerchief from my neck, and cutting it with my knifeinto half a dozen equal pieces, proceeded to make an exactdivision.</p><p> At first, Toby with a degree of fastidiousness that seemed to meill-timed, was for picking out the minute particles of tobaccowith which the spongy mass was mixed; but against this proceedingI protested, as by such an operation we must have greatlydiminished its quantity.</p><p> When the division was accomplished, we found that a day'sallowance for the two was not a great deal more than what atable-spoon might hold.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each separate portion we immediatelyrolled up in the bit of silk prepared for it, and joining themall together into a small package, I committed them, with solemninjunctions of fidelity, to the custody of Toby.&nbsp;&nbsp;For theremainder of that day we resolved to fast, as we had beenfortified by a breakfast in the morning; and now starting againto our feet, we looked about us for a shelter during the night,which, from the appearance of the heavens, promised to be a darkand tempestuous one.</p><p> There was no place near us which would in any way answer ourpurpose, so turning our backs upon Nukuheva, we commencedexploring the unknown regions which lay upon the other side ofthe mountain.</p><p> In this direction, as far as our vision extended, not a sign oflife, nor anything that denoted even the transient residence ofman, could be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole landscape seemed one unbrokensolitude, the interior of the island having apparently beenuntenanted since the morning of the creation; and as we advancedthrough this wilderness, our voices sounded strangely in ourears, as though human accents had never before disturbed thefearful silence of the place, interrupted only by the lowmurmurings of distant waterfalls.</p><p> Our disappointment, however, in not finding the various fruitswith which we had intended to regale ourselves during our stay inthese wilds, was a good deal lessened by the consideration thatfrom this very circumstance we should be much less exposed to acasual meeting with the savage tribes about us, who we knewalways dwelt beneath the shadows of those trees which suppliedthem with food.</p><p> We wandered along, casting eager glances into every bush wepassed, until just as we had succeeded in mounting one of themany ridges that intersected the ground, I saw in the grassbefore me something like an indistinctly traced footpath, whichappeared to lead along the top of the ridge, and to descend--withit into a deep ravine about half a mile in advance of us.</p><p> Robinson Crusoe could not have been more startled at thefootprint in the sand than we were at this unwelcome discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;My first impulse was to make as rapid a retreat as possible, andbend our steps in some other direction; but our curiosity to seewhither this path might lead, prompted us to pursue it.&nbsp;&nbsp;So on wewent, the track becoming more and more visible the farther weproceeded, until it conducted us to the verge of the ravine,where it abruptly terminated.</p><p> 'And so,' said Toby, peering down into the chasm, 'everyone thattravels this path takes a jump here, eh?'</p><p> 'Not so,' said I, 'for I think they might manage to descendwithout it; what say you,--shall we attempt the feat?'</p><p> 'And what, in the name of caves and coal-holes, do you expect tofind at the bottom of that gulf but a broken neck--why it looksblacker than our ship's hold, and the roar of those waterfallsdown there would batter one's brains to pieces.'</p><p> 'Oh, no, Toby,' I exclaimed, laughing; 'but there's something tobe seen here, that's plain, or there would have been no path, andI am resolved to find out what it is.'</p><p> 'I will tell you what, my pleasant fellow,' rejoined Tobyquickly, 'if you are going to pry into everything you meet withhere that excites your curiosity, you will marvellously soon getknocked on the head; to a dead certainty you will come bang upona party of these savages in the midst of your discovery-makings,and I doubt whether such an event would particularly delight you,just take my advice for once, and let us 'bout ship and steer insome other direction; besides, it's getting late and we ought tobe mooring ourselves for the night.'</p><p> 'That is just the thing I have been driving at,' replied I; 'andI am thinking that this ravine will exactly answer our purpose,for it is roomy, secluded, well watered, and may shelter us fromthe weather.'</p><p> 'Aye, and from sleep too, and by the same token will give us sorethroats, and rheumatisms into the bargain,' cried Toby, withevident dislike at the idea.</p><p> 'Oh, very well then, my lad,' said I, 'since you will notaccompany me, here I go alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see me in the morning;'and advancing to the edge of the cliff upon which we had beenstanding, I proceeded to lower myself down by the tangled rootswhich clustered about all the crevices of the rock.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I hadanticipated, Toby, in spite of his previous remonstrances,followed my example, and dropping himself with the activity of asquirrel from point to point, he quickly outstripped me andeffected a landing at the bottom before I had accomplishedtwo-thirds of the descent.</p><p> The sight that now greeted us was one that will ever be vividlyimpressed upon my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;Five foaming streams, rushing through asmany gorges, and swelled and turbid by the recent rains, unitedtogether in one mad plunge of nearly eighty feet, and fell withwild uproar into a deep black pool scooped out of the gloomylooking rocks that lay piled around, and thence in one collectedbody dashed down a narrow sloping channel which seemed topenetrate into the very bowels of the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overhead, vastroots of trees hung down from the sides of the ravine drippingwith moisture, and trembling with the concussions produced by thefall.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was now sunset, and the feeble uncertain light thatfound its way into these caverns and woody depths heightenedtheir strange appearance, and reminded us that in a short time weshould find ourselves in utter darkness.</p><p> As soon as I had satisfied my curiosity by gazing at this scene,I fell to wondering how it was that what we had taken for a pathshould have conducted us.to so singular a place, and began tosuspect that after all I might have been deceived in supposing itto have been a trick formed by the islanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was rather anagreeable reflection than otherwise, for it diminished our dreadof accidentally meeting with any of them, and I came to theconclusion that perhaps we could not have selected a more securehiding-place than this very spot we had so accidentally hit upon.</p><p> Toby agreed with me in this view of the matter, and weimmediately began gathering together the limbs of trees which layscattered about, with the view of constructing a temporary hutfor the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;This we were obliged to build close to the footof the cataract, for the current of water extended very nearly tothe sides of the gorge.&nbsp;&nbsp;The few moments of light that remainedwe employed in covering our hut with a species of broad-bladedgrass that grew in every fissure of the ravine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hut, if itdeserved to be called one, consisted of six or eight of thestraightest branches we could find laid obliquely against thesteep wall of rock, with their lower ends within a foot of thestream.&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the space thus covered over we managed to crawl,and dispose our wearied bodies as best we could.</p><p> Shall I ever forget that horrid night!&nbsp;&nbsp;As for poor Toby, I couldscarcely get a word out of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been someconsolation to have heard his voice, but he lay shivering thelive-long night like a man afflicted with the palsy, with hisknees drawn up to his head, while his back was supported againstthe dripping side of the rock.&nbsp;&nbsp;During this wretched night thereseemed nothing wanting to complete the perfect misery of ourcondition.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain descended in such torrents that our poorshelter proved a mere mockery.&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain did I try to elude theincessant streams that poured upon me; by protecting one part Ionly exposed another, and the water was continually finding somenew opening through which to drench us.</p><p> I have had many a ducking in the course of my life, and ingeneral cared little about it; but the accumulated horrors ofthat night, the deathlike coldness of the place, the appallingdarkness and the dismal sense of our forlorn condition, almostunmanned me.</p><p> It will not be doubted that the next morning we were earlyrisers, and as soon as I could catch the faintest glimpse ofanything like daylight I shook my companion by the arm, and toldhim it was sunrise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Toby lifted up his head, and after amoment's pause said, in a husky voice, 'Then, shipmate, mytoplights have gone out, for it appears darker now with my eyesopen that it did when they were shut.'</p><p> 'Nonsense!' exclaimed I; 'You are not awake yet.'</p><p> 'Awake!' roared Toby in a rage, 'awake!&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean to insinuateI've been asleep, do you?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an insult to a man to suppose hecould sleep in such an infernal place as this.'</p><p> By the time I had apologized to my friend for having misconstruedhis silence, it had become somewhat more light, and we crawledout of our lair.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain had ceased, but everything around uswas dripping with moisture.&nbsp;&nbsp;We stripped off our saturatedgarments, and wrung them as dry as we could.&nbsp;&nbsp;We contrived tomake the blood circulate in our benumbed limbs by rubbing themvigorously with our hands; and after performing our ablutions inthe stream, and putting on our still wet clothes, we began tothink it advisable to break our long fast, it being nowtwenty-four hours since we had tasted food.</p><p> Accordingly our day's ration was brought out, and seatingourselves on a detached fragment of rock, we proceeded to discussit.&nbsp;&nbsp;First we divided it into two equal portions, and carefullyrolling one of them up for our evening's repast, divided theremainder again as equally as possible, and then drew lots forthe first choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could have placed the morsel that fell to myshare upon the tip of my finger; but notwithstanding this I tookcare that it should be full ten minutes before I had swallowedthe last crumb.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a true saying it is that 'appetitefurnishes the best sauce.'&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flavour and a relish tothis small particle of food that under other circumstances itwould have been impossible for the most delicate viands to haveimparted.&nbsp;&nbsp;A copious draught of the pure water which flowed atour feet served to complete the meal, and after it we rosesensibly refreshed, and prepared for whatever might befall us.</p><p> We now carefully examined the chasm in which we had passed thenight.&nbsp;&nbsp;We crossed the stream, and gaining the further side ofthe pool I have mentioned, discovered proofs that the spot musthave been visited by some one but a short time previous to ourarrival.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further observation convinced us that it had beenregularly frequented, and, as we afterwards conjectured fromparticular indications, for the purpose of obtaining a certainroot, from which the natives obtained a kind of ointment.</p><p> These discoveries immediately determined us to abandon a placewhich had presented no inducement for us to remain, except thepromise of security; and as we looked about us for the means ofascending again into the upper regions, we at last found apracticable part of the rock, and half an hour's toil carried usto the summit of the same cliff from which the preceding eveningwe had descended.</p><p> I now proposed to Toby that instead of rambling about the island,exposing ourselves to discovery at every turn, we should selectsome place as our fixed abode for as long a period as our foodshould hold out, build ourselves a comfortable hut, and be asprudent and circumspect as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;To all this my companionassented, and we at once set about carrying the plan intoexecution.</p><p> With this view, after exploring without success a little glennear us, we crossed several of the ridges of which I have beforespoken; and about noon found ourselves ascending a long andgradually rising slope, but still without having discovered anyplace adapted to our purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;Low and heavy clouds betokened anapproaching storm, and we hurried on to gain a covert in a clumpof thick bushes, which appeared to terminate the long ascent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wethrew ourselves under the lee of these bushes, and pulling up thelong grass that grew around, covered ourselves completely withit, and awaited the shower.</p><p> But it did not come as soon as we had expected, and before manyminutes my companion was fast asleep, and I was rapidly fallinginto the same state of happy forgetfulness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just at thisjuncture, however, down came the rain with the violence that putall thoughts of slumber to flight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in some measuresheltered, our clothes soon became as wet as ever; this, afterall the trouble we had taken to dry them, was provoking enough:but there was no help for it; and I recommend all adventurousyouths who abandon vessels in romantic islands during the rainyseason to provide themselves with umbrellas.</p><p> After an hour or so the shower passed away.&nbsp;&nbsp;My companion sleptthrough it all, or at least appeared so to do; and now that itwas over I had not the heart to awaken him.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I lay on my backcompletely shrouded with verdure, the leafy branches droopingover me, my limbs buried in grass, I could not avoid comparingour situation with that of the interesting babes in the wood.&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor little sufferers!--no wonder their constitutions broke downunder the hardships to which they were exposed.</p><p> During the hour or two spent under the shelter of these bushes, Ibegan to feel symptoms which I at once attributed to the exposureof the preceding night.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold shiverings and a burning feversucceeded one another at intervals, while one of my legs wasswelled to such a degree, and pained me so acutely, that I halfsuspected I had been bitten by some venomous reptile, thecongenial inhabitant of the chasm from which we had latelyemerged.&nbsp;&nbsp;I may here remark by the way--what I subsequentlygleamed--that all the islands of Polynesia enjoy the reputation,in common with the Hibernian isle, of being free from thepresence of any vipers; though whether Saint Patrick ever visitedthem, is a question I shall not attempt to decide.</p><p> As the feverish sensation increased upon me I tossed about, stillunwilling to disturb my slumbering companion, from whose side Iremoved two or three yards.&nbsp;&nbsp;I chanced to push aside a branch,and by so doing suddenly disclosed to my view a scene which evennow I can recall with all the vividness of the first impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a glimpse of the gardens of Paradise been revealed to me, Icould scarcely have been more ravished with the sight.</p><p> From the spot where I lay transfixed with surprise and delight, Ilooked straight down into the bosom of a valley, which swept awayin long wavy undulations to the blue waters in the distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Midway towards the sea, and peering here and there amidst thefoliage, might be seen the palmetto-thatched houses of itsinhabitants glistening in the sun that had bleached them to adazzling whiteness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vale was more than three leagues inlength, and about a mile across at its greatest width.</p><p> On either side it appeared hemmed in by steep and greenacclivities, which, uniting near the spot where I lay, formed anabrupt and semicircular termination of grassy cliffs andprecipices hundreds of feet in height, over which flowednumberless small cascades.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the crowning beauty of theprospect was its universal verdure; and in this indeed consists,I believe, the peculiar charm of every Polynesian landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere below me, from the base of the precipice upon whosevery verge I had been unconsciously reposing, the surface of thevale presented a mass of foliage, spread with such rich profusionthat it was impossible to determine of what description of treesit consisted.</p><p> But perhaps there was nothing about the scenery I beheld moreimpressive than those silent cascades, whose slender threads ofwater, after leaping down the steep cliffs, were lost amidst therich herbage of the valley.</p><p> Over all the landscape there reigned the most hushed repose,which I almost feared to break, lest, like the enchanted gardensin the fairy tale, a single syllable might dissolve the spell.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, forgetful alike of my own situation, and thevicinity of my still slumbering companion, I remained gazingaround me, hardly able to comprehend by what means I had thussuddenly been made a spectator of such a scene.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Eight</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p> THE IMPORTANT QUESTION, TYPEE OR HAPPAR?--A WILD GOOSE CHASE--MYSUFFERINGS--DISHEARTENING SITUATION--A NIGHT IN A RAVINE--MORNINGMEAL--HAPPY IDEA OF TOBY--JOURNEY TOWARDS THE VALLEY</p><p> RECOVERING from my astonishment at the beautiful scene before me,I quickly awakened Toby, and informed him of the discovery I hadmade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Together we now repaired to the border of the precipice,and my companion's admiration was equal to my own.&nbsp;&nbsp;A littlereflection, however, abated our surprise at coming sounexpectedly upon this valley, since the large vales of Happarand Typee, lying upon this side of Nukuheva, and extending aconsiderable distance from the sea towards the interior, mustnecessarily terminate somewhere about this point.</p><p> The question now was as to which of those two places we werelooking down upon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby insisted that it was the abode of theHappar, and I that it was tenanted by their enemies the ferociousTypees.&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure I was not entirely convinced by my ownarguments, but Toby's proposition to descend at once into thevalley, and partake of the hospitality of its inmates, seemed tome to be risking so much upon the strength of a mere supposition,that I resolved to oppose it until we had more evidence toproceed upon.</p><p> The point was one of vital importance, as the natives of Happarwere not only at peace with Nukuheva, but cultivated with itsinhabitants the most friendly relations, and enjoyed besides areputation for gentleness and humanity which led us to expectfrom them, if not a cordial reception, at least a shelter duringthe short period we should remain in their territory.</p><p> On the other hand, the very name of Typee struck a panic into myheart which I did not attempt to disguise.&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought ofvoluntarily throwing ourselves into the hands of these cruelsavages, seemed to me an act of mere madness; and almost equallyso the idea of venturing into the valley, uncertain by which ofthese two tribes it was inhabited.&nbsp;&nbsp;That the vale at our feet wastenanted by one of them, was a point that appeared to us past alldoubt, since we knew that they resided in this quarter, althoughour information did not enlighten us further.</p><p> My companion, however, incapable of resisting the temptingprospect which the place held out of an abundant supply of foodand other means of enjoyment, still clung to his owninconsiderate view of the subject, nor could all my reasoningshake it.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I reminded him that it was impossible for eitherof us to know anything with certainty, and when I dwelt upon thehorrible fate we should encounter were we rashly to descend intothe valley, and discover too late the error we had committed, hereplied by detailing all the evils of our present condition, andthe sufferings we must undergo should we continue to remain wherewe then were.</p><p> Anxious to draw him away from the subject, if possible--for I sawthat it would be in vain to attempt changing his mind--I directedhis attention to a long bright unwooded tract of land which,sweeping down from the elevations in the interior, descended intothe valley before us.&nbsp;&nbsp;I then suggested to him that beyond thisridge might lie a capacious and untenanted valley, abounding withall manner of delicious fruits; for I had heard that there wereseveral such upon the island, and proposed that we shouldendeavour to reach it, and if we found our expectations realizedwe should at once take refuge in it and remain there as long aswe pleased.</p><p> He acquiesced in the suggestion; and we immediately, therefore,began surveying the country lying before us, with a view ofdetermining upon the best route for us to pursue; but itpresented little choice, the whole interval being broken intosteep ridges, divided by dark ravines, extending in parallellines at right angles to our direct course.&nbsp;&nbsp;All these we wouldbe obliged to cross before we could hope to arrive at ourdestination.</p><p> A weary journey!&nbsp;&nbsp;But we decided to undertake it, though, for myown part, I felt little prepared to encounter its fatigues,shivering and burning by turns with the ague and fever; for Iknow not how else to describe the alternate sensations Iexperienced, and suffering not a little from the lameness whichafflicted me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Added to this was the faintness consequent on ourmeagre diet--a calamity in which Toby participated to the sameextent as myself.</p><p> These circumstances, however, only augmented my anxiety to reacha place which promised us plenty and repose, before I should bereduced to a state which would render me altogether unable toperform the journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly we now commenced it bydescending the almost perpendicular side of a steep and narrowgorge, bristling with a thick growth of reeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here there wasbut one mode for us to adopt.&nbsp;&nbsp;We seated ourselves upon theground, and guided our descent by catching at the canes in ourpath.&nbsp;&nbsp;This velocity with which we thus slid down the side of theravine soon brought us to a point where we could use our feet,and in a short time we arrived at the edge of the torrent, whichrolled impetuously along the bed of the chasm.</p><p> After taking a refreshing draught from the water of the stream,we addressed ourselves to a much more difficult undertaking thanthe last.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every foot of our late descent had to be regained inascending the opposite side of the gorge--an operation renderedthe less agreeable from the consideration that in theseperpendicular episodes we did not progress a hundred yards on ourjourney.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ungrateful as the task was, we set about it withexemplary patience, and after a snail-like progress of an hour ormore, had scaled perhaps one half of the distance, when the feverwhich had left me for a while returned with such violence, andaccompanied by so raging a thirst, that it required all theentreaties of Toby to prevent me from losing all the fruits of mylate exertion, by precipitating myself madly down the cliffs wehad just climbed, in quest of the water which flowed sotemptingly at their base.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment all my hopes and fearsappeared to be merged in this one desire, careless of theconsequences that might result from its gratification.&nbsp;&nbsp;I amaware of no feeling, either of pleasure or of pain, that socompletely deprives one of an power to resist its impulses, asthis same raging thirst.</p><p> Toby earnestly conjured me to continue the ascent, assuring methat a little more exertion would bring us to the summit, andthat then in less than five minutes we should find ourselves atthe brink of the stream, which must necessarily flow on the otherside of the ridge.</p><p> 'Do not,' he exclaimed, 'turn back, now that we have proceededthus far; for I tell you that neither of us will have the courageto repeat the attempt, if once more we find ourselves looking upto where we now are from the bottom of these rocks!'</p><p> I was not yet so perfectly beside myself as to be heedless ofthese representations, and therefore toiled on, ineffectuallyendeavouring to appease the thirst which consumed me, by thinkingthat in a short time I should be able to gratify it to my heart'scontent.</p><p> At last we gained the top of the second elevation, the loftiestof those I have described as.&nbsp;&nbsp;extending in parallel linesbetween us and the valley we desired to reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;It commanded aview of the whole intervening distance; and, discouraged as I wasby other circumstances, this prospect plunged me into the verydepths of despair.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but dark and fearful chasms,separated by sharp-crested and perpendicular ridges as far as theeye could reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we have stepped from summit to summit ofthese steep but narrow elevations we could easily haveaccomplished the distance; but we must penetrate to the bottom ofevery yawning gulf, and scale in succession every one of theeminences before us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Toby, although not suffering as I did,was not proof against the disheartening influences of the sight.</p><p> But we did not long stand to contemplate it, impatient as I wasto reach the waters of the torrent which flowed beneath us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Withan insensibility to danger which I cannot call to mind withoutshuddering, we threw ourselves down the depths of the ravine,startling its savage solitudes with the echoes produced by thefalling fragments of rock we every moment dislodged from theirplaces, careless of the insecurity of our footing, and recklesswhether the slight roots and twigs we clutched at sustained usfor the while, or treacherously yielded to our grasp.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my ownpart, I scarcely knew whether I was helplessly falling from theheights above, or whether the fearful rapidity with which Idescended was an act of my own volition.</p><p> In a few minutes we reached the foot of the gorge, and kneelingupon a small ledge of dripping rocks, I bent over to the stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a delicious sensation was I now to experience!&nbsp;&nbsp;I paused fora second to concentrate all my capabilities of enjoyment, andthen immerged my lips in the clear element before me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had theapples of Sodom turned to ashes in my mouth, I could not havefelt a more startling revulsion.&nbsp;&nbsp;A single drop of the cold fluidseemed to freeze every drop of blood in my body; the fever thathad been burning in my veins gave place on the instant todeath-like chills, which shook me one after another like so manyshocks of electricity, while the perspiration produced by my lateviolent exertions congealed in icy beads upon my forehead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mythirst was gone, and I fairly loathed the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting to myfeet, the sight of those dank rocks, oozing forth moisture atevery crevice, and the dark stream shooting along its dismalchannel, sent fresh chills through my shivering frame, and I feltas uncontrollable a desire to climb up towards the genialsunlight as I before had to descend the ravine.</p><p> After two hours' perilous exertions we stood upon the summit ofanother ridge, and it was with difficulty I could bring myself tobelieve that we had ever penetrated the black and yawning chasmwhich then gaped at our feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again we gazed upon the prospectwhich the height commanded, but it was just as depressing as theone which had before met our eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I now felt that in ourpresent situation it was in vain for us to think of everovercoming the obstacles in our way, and I gave up all thoughtsof reaching the vale which lay beyond this series of impediments;while at the same time I could not devise any scheme to extricateourselves from the difficulties in which we were involved.</p><p> The remotest idea of returning to Nukuheva, unless assured of ourvessel's departure, never once entered my mind, and indeed it wasquestionable whether we could have succeeded in reaching it,divided as we were from the bay by a distance we could notcompute, and perplexed too in our remembrance of localities byour recent wanderings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, it was unendurable the thoughtof retracing our steps and rendering all our painful exertions ofno avail.</p><p> There is scarcely anything when a man is in difficulties that heis more disposed to look upon with abhorrence than a rightaboutretrograde movement--a systematic going over of the alreadytrodden ground: and especially if he has a love of adventure,such a course appears indescribably repulsive, so long as thereremains the least hope to be derived from braving untrieddifficulties.</p><p> It was this feeling that prompted us to descend the opposite sideof the elevation we had just scaled, although with what definiteobject in view it would have been impossible for either of us totell.</p><p> Without exchanging a syllable upon the subject, Toby and myselfsimultaneously renounced the design which had lured us thusfar--perceiving in each other's countenances that despondingexpression which speaks more eloquently than words.</p><p> Together we stood towards the close of this weary day in thecavity of the third gorge we had entered, wholly incapacitatedfor any further exertion, until restored to some degree ofstrength by food and repose.</p><p> We seated ourselves upon the least uncomfortable spot we couldselect, and Toby produced from the bosom of his frock the sacredpackage.&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence we partook of the small morsel ofrefreshment that had been left from the morning's repast, andwithout once proposing to violate the sanctity of our engagementwith respect to the remainder, we rose to our feet, and proceededto construct some sort of shelter under which we might obtain thesleep we so greatly needed.</p><p> Fortunately the spot was better adapted to our purpose than theone in which we had passed the last wretched night.&nbsp;&nbsp;We clearedaway the tall reeds from the small but almost level bit ofground, and twisted them into a low basket-like hut, which wecovered with a profusion of long thick leaves, gathered from atree near at hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;We disposed them thickly all around,reserving only a slight opening that barely permitted us to crawlunder the shelter we had thus obtained.</p><p> These deep recesses, though protected from the winds that assailthe summits of their lofty sides, are damp and chill to a degreethat one would hardly anticipate in such a climate; and beingunprovided with anything but our woollen frocks and thin ducktrousers to resist the cold of the place, we were the moresolicitous to render our habitation for the night as comfortableas we could.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in addition to what we had alreadydone, we plucked down all the leaves within our reach and threwthem in a heap over our little hut, into which we now crept,raking after us a reserved supply to form our couch.</p><p> That night nothing but the pain I suffered prevented me fromsleeping most refreshingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it was, I caught two or threenaps, while Toby slept away at my side as soundly as though hehad been sandwiched between two Holland sheets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily it didnot rain, and we were preserved from the misery which a heavyshower would have occasioned us.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning I was awakenedby the sonorous voice of my companion ringing in my ears andbidding me rise.&nbsp;&nbsp;I crawled out from our heap of leaves, and wasastonished at the change which a good night's rest had wrought inhis appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was as blithe and joyous as a young bird, andwas staying the keenness of his morning's appetite by chewing thesoft bark of a delicate branch he held in his hand, and herecommended the like to me as an admirable antidote against thegnawings of hunger.</p><p> For my own part, though feeling materially better than I had donethe preceding evening, I could not look at the limb that hadpained me so violently at intervals during the last twenty-fourhours, without experiencing a sense of alarm that I strove invain to shake off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwilling to disturb the flow of my comrade'sspirits, I managed to stifle the complaints to which I mightotherwise have given vent, and calling upon him good-humouredlyto speed our banquet, I prepared myself for it by washing in thestream.&nbsp;&nbsp;This operation concluded, we swallowed, or ratherabsorbed, by a peculiar kind of slow sucking process, ourrespective morsels of nourishment, and then entered into adiscussion as to the steps is was necessary for us to pursue.</p><p> 'What's to be done now?'&nbsp;&nbsp;inquired I, rather dolefully.</p><p> 'Descend into that same valley we descried yesterday.'&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoinedToby, with a rapidity and loudness of utterance that almost ledme to suspect he had been slyly devouring the broadside of an oxin some of the adjoining thickets.&nbsp;&nbsp;'What else,' he continued,'remains for us to do but that, to be sure?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, we shall bothstarve to a certainty if we remain here; and as to your fears ofthose Typees--depend upon it, it is all nonsense.'</p><p> 'It is impossible that the inhabitants of such a lovely place aswe saw can be anything else but good fellows; and if you chooserather to perish with hunger in one of these soppy caverns, I forone prefer to chance a bold descent into the valley, and risk theconsequences'.</p><p> 'And who is to pilot us thither,' I asked, 'even if we shoulddecide upon the measure you propose?&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we to go again up anddown those precipices that we crossed yesterday, until we reachthe place we started from, and then take a flying leap from thecliffs to the valley?'</p><p> 'Faith, I didn't think of that,' said Toby; 'sure enough, bothsides of the valley appeared to be hemmed in by precipices,didn't they?'</p><p> 'Yes,' answered I, 'as steep as the sides of a line-of-battleship, and about a hundred times as high.'&nbsp;&nbsp;My companion sank hishead upon his breast, and remained for a while in deep thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly he sprang to his feet, while his eyes lighted up withthat gleam of intelligence that marks the presence of some brightidea.</p><p> 'Yes, yes,' he exclaimed; 'the streams all run in the samedirection, and must necessarily flow into the valley before theyreach the sea; all we have to do is just to follow this stream,and sooner or later it will lead us into the vale.'</p><p> 'You are right, Toby,' I exclaimed, 'you are right; it mustconduct us thither, and quickly too; for, see with what a steepinclination the water descends.'</p><p> 'It does, indeed,' burst forth my companion, overjoyed at myverification of his theory, 'it does indeed; why, it is as plainas a pike-staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us proceed at once; come, throw away allthose stupid ideas about the Typees, and hurrah for the lovelyvalley of the Happars.'</p><p> 'You will have it to be Happar, I see, my dear fellow; prayHeaven you may not find yourself deceived,' observed I, with ashake of my head.</p><p> 'Amen to all that, and much more,' shouted Toby, rushing forward;'but Happar it is, for nothing else than Happar can it be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soglorious a valley--such forests of bread-fruit trees--such grovesof cocoanut--such wilderness of guava-bushes!&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;shipmate!don't linger behind: in the name of all delightful fruits, I amdying to be at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on, come on; shove ahead, there's alively lad; never mind the rocks; kick them out of the way, as Ido; and tomorrow, old fellow, take my word for it, we shall be inclover.&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on;' and so saying, he dashed along the ravine likea madman, forgetting my inability to keep up with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fewminutes, however, the exuberance of his spirits abated, and,pausing for a while, he permitted me to overtake him.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Nine</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER NINE</p><p> PERILOUS PASSAGE OF THE RAVINE--DESCENT INTO THE VALLEY</p><p> The fearless confidence of Toby was contagious, and I began toadopt the Happar side of the question.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not, however,overcome a certain feeling of trepidation as we made our wayalong these gloomy solitudes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our progress, at firstcomparatively easy, became more and more difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed ofthe watercourse was covered with fragments of broken rocks, whichhad fallen from above, offering so many obstructions to thecourse of the rapid stream, which vexed and fretted aboutthem,--forming at intervals small waterfalls, pouring over intodeep basins, or splashing wildly upon heaps of stones.</p><p> From the narrowness of the gorge, and the steepness of its sides,there was no mode of advancing but by wading through the water;stumbling every moment over the impediments which lay hiddenunder its surface, or tripping against the huge roots of trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most annoying hindrance we encountered was from amultitude of crooked boughs, which, shooting out almosthorizontally from the sides of the chasm, twisted themselvestogether in fantastic masses almost to the surface of the stream,affording us no passage except under the low arches which theyformed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these we were obliged to crawl on our hands andfeet, sliding along the oozy surface of the rocks, or slippinginto the deep pools, and with scarce light enough to guide us.Occasionally we would strike our heads against some projectinglimb of a tree; and while imprudently engaged in rubbing theinjured part, would fall sprawling amongst filthy fragments,cutting and bruising ourselves, whilst the unpitying watersflowed over our prostrate bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Belzoni, worming himselfthrough the subterranean passages of the Egyptian catacombs,could not have met with great impediments than those we hereencountered.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we struggled against them manfully, wellknowing our only hope lay in advancing.</p><p> Towards sunset we halted at a spot where we made preparations forpassing the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we constructed a hut, in much the sameway as before, and crawling into it, endeavoured to forget oursufferings.&nbsp;&nbsp;My companion, I believe, slept pretty soundly; butat day break, when we rolled out of our dwelling, I felt nearlydisqualified for any further efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby prescribed as aremedy for my illness the contents of one of our little silkpackages, to be taken at once in a single dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;To this speciesof medical treatment, however, I would by no means accede, muchas he insisted upon it; and so we partook of our usual morsel,and silently resumed our journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was now the fourth daysince we left Nukuheva, and the gnawings of hunger becamepainfully acute.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were fain to pacify them by chewing thetender bark of roots and twigs, which, if they did not afford usnourishment, were at least sweet and pleasant to the taste.</p><p> Our progress along the steep watercourse was necessarily slow,and by noon we had not advanced more than a mile.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wassomewhere near this part of the day that the noise of fallingwaters, which we had faintly caught in the early morning, becamemore distinct; and it was not long before we were arrested by arocky precipice of nearly a hundred feet in depth, that extendedall across the channel, and over which the wild stream poured inan unbroken leap.&nbsp;&nbsp;On each hand the walls of the ravine presentedtheir overhanging sides both above and below the fall, affordingno means whatever of avoiding the cataract by taking a circuitround it.</p><p> 'What's to be done now, Toby?'&nbsp;&nbsp;said I.</p><p> 'Why,' rejoined he, 'as we cannot retreat, I suppose we must keepshoving along.'</p><p> 'Very true, my dear Toby; but how do you purpose accomplishingthat desirable object?'</p><p> 'By jumping from the top of the fall, if there be no other way,'unhesitatingly replied my companion: 'it will be much thequickest way of descent; but as you are not quite as active as Iam, we will try some other way.'</p><p> And, so saying, he crept cautiously along and peered over intothe abyss, while I remained wondering by what possible means wecould overcome this apparently insuperable obstruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soonas my companion had completed his survey, I eagerly inquired theresult.</p><p> 'The result of my observations you wish to know, do you?'&nbsp;&nbsp;beganToby, deliberately, with one of his odd looks: 'well, my lad, theresult of my observations is very quickly imparted.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is atpresent uncertain which of our two necks will have the honour tobe broken first; but about a hundred to one would be a fair betin favour of the man who takes the first jump.'</p><p> 'Then it is an impossible thing, is it?'&nbsp;&nbsp;inquired I gloomily.</p><p> 'No, shipmate; on the contrary, it is the easiest thing in life:the only awkward point is the sort of usage which our unhappylimbs may receive when we arrive at the bottom, and what sort oftravelling trim we shall be in afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;But follow me now,and I will show you the only chance we have.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this heconducted me to the verge of the cataract, and pointed along theside of the ravine to a number of curious looking roots, somethree or four inches in thickness, and several feet long, which,after twisting among the fissures of the rock, shotperpendicularly from it and ran tapering to a point in the air,hanging over the gulf like so many dark icicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;They coverednearly the entire surface of one side of the gorge, the lowest ofthem reaching even to the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many were moss grown anddecayed, with their extremities snapped short off, and those inthe immediate vicinity of the fall were slippery with moisture.</p><p> Toby's scheme, and it was a desperate one, was to entrustourselves to these treacherous-looking roots, and by slippingdown from one to another to gain the bottom.</p><p> 'Are you ready to venture it?'&nbsp;&nbsp;asked Toby, looking at meearnestly but without saying a word as to the practicability ofthe plan.</p><p> 'I am,' was my reply; for I saw it was our only resource if wewished to advance, and as for retreating, all thoughts of thatsort had been long abandoned.</p><p> After I had signified my assent, Toby, without uttering a asingle word, crawled along the dripping ledge until he gained apoint from whence he could just reach one of the largest of thependant roots; he shook it--it quivered in his grasp, and when helet it go it twanged in the air like a strong, wire sharplystruck.&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfied by his scrutiny, my light limbed companionswung himself nimbly upon it, and twisting his legs round it insailor fashion, slipped down eight or ten feet, where his weightgave it a motion not un-like that of a pendulum.&nbsp;&nbsp;He could notventure to descend any further; so holding on with one hand, hewith the other shook one by one all the slender roots around him,and at last, finding one which he thought trustworthy, shiftedhim self to it and continued his downward progress.</p><p> So far so well; but I could not avoid comparing my heavier frameand disabled condition with his light figure and remarkableactivity; but there was no help for it, and in less than aminute's time I was swinging directly over his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon ashis upturned eyes caught a glimpse of me, he exclaimed in hisusual dry tone, for the danger did not seem to daunt him in theleast, 'Mate, do me the kindness not to fall until I get out ofyour way;' and then swinging himself more on one side, hecontinued his descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mean time I cautiously transferredmyself from the limb down which I had been slipping to a coupleof others that were near it, deeming two strings to my bow betterthan one, and taking care to test their strength before I trustedmy weight to them.</p><p> On arriving towards the end of the second stage in this verticaljourney, and shaking the long roots which were round me, to myconsternation they snapped off one after another like so manypipe stems, and fell in fragments against the side of the gulf,splashing at last into the waters beneath.</p><p> As one after another the treacherous roots yielded to my grasp,and fell into the torrent, my heart sunk within me.&nbsp;&nbsp;The brancheson which I was suspended over the yawning chasm swang to and froin the air, and I expected them every moment to snap in twain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Appalled at the dreadful fate that menaced me, I clutchedfrantically at the only large root which remained near me, but invain; I could not reach it, though my fingers were within a fewinches of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again and again I tried to reach it, until atlength, maddened with the thought of my situation, I swayedmyself violently by striking my foot against the side of therock, and at the instant that I approached the large root caughtdesperately at it, and transferred myself to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It vibratedviolently under the sudden weight, but fortunately did not giveway.</p><p> My brain grew dizzy with the idea of the frightful risk I hadjust run, and I involuntarily closed my eyes to shut out the viewof the depth beneath me.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the instant I was safe, and Iuttered a devout ejaculation of thanksgiving for my escape.</p><p> 'Pretty well done,' shouted Toby underneath me; 'you are nimblerthan I thought you to be--hopping about up there from root toroot like any young squirrel.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you have divertedyourself sufficiently, I would advise you to proceed.'</p><p> 'Aye, aye, Toby, all in good time: two or three more such famousroots as this, and I shall be with you.'</p><p> The residue of my downward progress was comparatively easy; theroots were in greater abundance, and in one or two places juttingout points of rock assisted me greatly.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few moments I wasstanding by the side of my companion.</p><p> Substituting a stout stick for the one I had thrown aside at thetop of the precipice, we now continued our course along the bedof the ravine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon we were saluted by a sound in advance, thatgrew by degrees louder and louder, as the noise of the cataractwe were leaving behind gradually died on our ears.</p><p> 'Another precipice for us, Toby.'</p><p> 'Very good; we can descend them, you know--come on.'</p><p> Nothing indeed appeared to depress or intimidate this intrepidfellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Typees or Niagaras, he was as ready to engage one as theother, and I could not avoid a thousand times congratulatingmyself upon having such a companion in an enterprise like thepresent.</p><p> After an hour's painful progress, we reached the verge of anotherfall, still loftier than the preceding and flanked both above andbelow with the same steep masses of rock, presenting, however,here and there narrow irregular ledges, supporting a shallowsoil, on which grew a variety of bushes and trees, whose brightverdure contrasted beautifully with the foamy waters that flowedbetween them.</p><p> Toby, who invariably acted as pioneer, now proceeded toreconnoitre.&nbsp;&nbsp;On his return, he reported that the shelves of rockon our right would enable us to gain with little risk the bottomof the cataract.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, leaving the bed of the stream atthe very point where it thundered down, we began crawling alongone of those sloping ledges until it carried us to within a fewfeet of another that inclined downwards at a still sharper angle,and upon which, by assisting each other we managed to alight insafety.&nbsp;&nbsp;We warily crept along this, steadying ourselves by thenaked roots of the shrubs that clung to every fissure.&nbsp;&nbsp;As weproceeded, the narrow path became still more contracted,rendering it difficult for us to maintain our footing, untilsuddenly, as we reached an angle of the wall of rock where we hadexpected it to widen, we perceived to our consternation that ayard or two further on it abruptly terminated at a place we couldnot possibly hope to pass.</p><p> Toby as usual led the van, and in silence I waited to learn fromhim how he proposed to extricate us from this new difficulty.</p><p> 'Well, my boy,' I exclaimed, after the expiration of severalminutes, during which time my companion had not uttered a word,'what's to be done now?'</p><p> He replied in a tranquil tone, that probably the best thing wecould do in our present strait was to get out of it as soon aspossible.</p><p> 'Yes, my dear Toby, but tell me how we are to get out of it.'</p><p> 'Something in this sort of style,' he replied, and at the samemoment to my horror he slipped sideways off the rocks and, as Ithen thought, by good fortune merely, alighted among thespreading branches of a species of palm tree, that shooting itshardy roots along a ledge below, curved its trunk upwards intothe air, and presented a thick mass of foliage about twenty feetbelow the spot where we had thus suddenly been brought to astandstill.&nbsp;&nbsp;I involuntarily held my breath, expecting to see theform of my companion, after being sustained for a moment by thebranches of the tree, sink through their frail support, and fallheadlong to the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my surprise and joy, however, herecovered himself, and disentangling his limbs from the fracturedbranches, he peered out from his leafy bed, and shouted lustily,'Come on, my hearty there is no other alternative!' and with thishe ducked beneath the foliage, and slipping down the trunk, stoodin a moment at least fifty feet beneath me, upon the broad shelfof rock from which sprung the tree he had descended.</p><p> What would I not have given at that moment to have been by hisside.&nbsp;&nbsp;The feat he had just accomplished seemed little less thanmiraculous, and I could hardly credit the evidence of my senseswhen I saw the wide distance that a single daring act had sosuddenly placed between us.</p><p> Toby's animating 'come on' again sounded in my ears, and dreadingto lose all confidence in myself if I remained meditating uponthe step, I once more gazed down to assure myself of the relativebearing of the tree and my own position, and then closing my eyesand uttering one comprehensive ejaculation of prayer, I inclinedmyself over towards the abyss, and after one breathless instantfell with a crash into the tree, the branches snapping andcracking with my weight, as I sunk lower and lower among them,until I was stopped by coming in contact with a sturdy limb.</p><p> In a few moments I was standing at the foot of the treemanipulating myself all over with a view of ascertaining theextent of the injuries I had received.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my surprise the onlyeffects of my feat were a few slight contusions too trifling tocare about.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of our descent was easily accomplished, andin half an hour after regaining the ravine we had partaken of ourevening morsel, built our hut as usual, and crawled under itsshelter.</p><p> The next morning, in spite of our debility and the agony ofhunger under which we were now suffering, though neither of usconfessed to the fact, we struggled along our dismal and stilldifficult and dangerous path, cheered by the hope of sooncatching a glimpse of the valley before us, and towards eveningthe voice of a cataract which had for some time sounded like alow deep bass to the music of the smaller waterfalls, broke uponour ears in still louder tones, and assured us that we wereapproaching its vicinity.</p><p> That evening we stood on the brink of a precipice, over which thedark stream bounded in one final leap of full 300 feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thesheer descent terminated in the region we so long had sought.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oneach side of the fall, two lofty and perpendicular bluffsbuttressed the sides of the enormous cliff, and projected intothe sea of verdure with which the valley waved, and a range ofsimilar projecting eminences stood disposed in a half circleabout the head if the vale.&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick canopy of trees hung overthe very verge of the fall, leaving an arched aperture for thepassage of the waters, which imparted a strange picturesquenessto the scene.</p><p> The valley was now before us; but instead of being conducted intoits smiling bosom by the gradual descent of the deep watercoursewe had thus far pursued, all our labours now appeared to havebeen rendered futile by its abrupt termination.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, bitterlydisappointed, we did not entirely despair.</p><p> As it was now near sunset we determined to pass the night wherewe were, and on the morrow, refreshed by sleep, and by eating atone meal all our stock of food, to accomplish a descent into thevalley, or perish in the attempt.</p><p> We laid ourselves down that night on a spot, the recollection ofwhich still makes me shudder.&nbsp;&nbsp;A small table of rock whichprojected over the precipice on one side of the stream, and wasdrenched by the spray of the fall, sustained a huge trunk of atree which must have been deposited there by some heavy freshet.&nbsp;&nbsp;It lay obliquely, with one end resting on the rock and the othersupported by the side of the ravine.&nbsp;&nbsp;against it we placed in asloping direction a number of the half decayed boughs that werestrewn about, and covering the whole with twigs and leaves,awaited the morning's light beneath such shelter as it afforded. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the whole of this night the continual roaring of thecataract--the dismal moaning of the gale through the trees--thepattering of the rain, and the profound darkness, affected myspirits to a degree which nothing had ever before produced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet,half famished, and chilled to the heart with the dampness of theplace, and nearly wild with the pain I endured, I fairly cowereddown to the earth under this multiplication of hardships, andabandoned myself to frightful anticipations of evil; and mycompanion, whose spirit at last was a good deal broken, scarcelyuttered a word during the whole night.</p><p> At length the day dawned upon us, and rising from our miserablepallet, we stretched our stiffened joints, and after eating allthat remained of our bread, prepared for the last stage of ourjourney.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not recount every hair-breadth escape, andevery fearful difficulty that occurred before we succeeded inreaching the bosom of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already describedsimilar scenes, it will be sufficient to say that at length,after great toil and great dangers, we both stood with no limbsbroken at the head of that magnificent vale which five daysbefore had so suddenly burst upon my sight, and almost beneaththe shadow of those very cliffs from whose summits we had gazedupon the prospect.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Ten</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TEN</p><p> THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY--CAUTIOUS ADVANCE--APATH--FRUIT--DISCOVERY OF TWO OF THE NATIVES--THEIR SINGULARCONDUCT--APPROACH TOWARDS THE INHABITED PARTS OF THEVALE--SENSATION PRODUCED BY OUR APPEARANCE--RECEPTION AT THEHOUSE OF ONE OF THE NATIVES</p><p> HOW to obtain the fruit which we felt convinced must grow near athand was our first thought.</p><p> Typee or Happar?&nbsp;&nbsp;A frightful death at the hands of the fiercestof cannibals, or a kindly reception from a gentler race ofsavages?&nbsp;&nbsp;Which?&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was too late now to discuss a questionwhich would so soon be answered.</p><p> The part of the valley in which we found ourselves appeared to bealtogether uninhabited.&nbsp;&nbsp;An almost impenetrable thicket extendedfrom side to side, without presenting a single plant affordingthe nourishment we had confidently calculated upon; and with thisobject, we followed the course of the stream, casting quickglances as we proceeded into the thick jungles on each hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mycompanion--to whose solicitations I had yielded in descendinginto the valley--now that the step was taken, began to manifest adegree of caution I had little expected from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He proposedthat in the event of our finding an adequate supply of fruit, weshould remain in this unfrequented portion of the country--wherewe should run little chance of being surprised by its occupants,whoever they might be--until sufficiently recruited to resume ourjourney; when laying a store of food equal to our wants, we mighteasily regain the bay of Nukuheva, after the lapse of asufficient interval to ensure the departure of our vessel.</p><p> I objected strongly to this proposition, plausible as it was, asthe difficulties of the route would be almost insurmountable,unacquainted as we were with the general bearings of the country,and I reminded my companion of the hardships which we had alreadyencountered in our uncertain wanderings; in a word, I said thatsince we had deemed it advisable to enter the valley, we oughtmanfully to face the consequences, whatever they might be; themore especially as I was convinced there was no alternative leftus but to fall in with the natives at once, and boldly risk thereception they might give us; and that as to myself, I felt thenecessity of rest and shelter, and that until I had obtainedthem, I should be wholly unable to encounter such sufferings aswe had lately passed through.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the justice of theseobservations Toby somewhat reluctantly assented.</p><p> We were surprised that, after moving as far as we had along thevalley, we should still meet with the same impervious thickets;and thinking, that although the borders of the stream might belined for some distance with them, yet beyond there might be moreopen ground, I requested Toby to keep a bright look-out upon oneside, while I did the same on the other, in order to discoversome opening in the bushes, and especially to watch for theslightest appearance of a path or anything else that mightindicate the vicinity of the islanders.</p><p> What furtive and anxious glances we cast into those dim-lookingshadows!&nbsp;&nbsp;With what apprehensions we proceeded, ignorant at whatmoment we might be greeted by the javelin of some ambushedsavage.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last my companion paused, and directed my attentionto a narrow opening in the foliage.&nbsp;&nbsp;We struck into it, and itsoon brought us by an indistinctly traced path to a comparativelyclear space, at the further end of which we descried a number ofthe trees, the native name of which is 'annuee', and which bear amost delicious fruit.&nbsp;&nbsp;W hat a race!&nbsp;&nbsp;I hobbling over the groundlike some decrepid wretch, and Toby leaping forward like agreyhound.&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly cleared one of the trees on which therewere two or three of the fruit, but to our chagrin they proved tobe much decayed; the rinds partly opened by the birds, and theirhearts half devoured.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we quickly despatched them, andno ambrosia could have been more delicious.</p><p> We looked about us uncertain whither to direct our steps, sincethe path we had so far followed appeared to be lost in the openspace around us.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last we resolved to enter a grove near athand, and had advanced a few rods, when, just upon its skirts, Ipicked up a slender bread-fruit shoot perfectly green, and withthe tender.&nbsp;&nbsp;bark freshly stripped from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was stillslippery with moisture, and appeared as if it had been but thatmoment thrown aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;I said nothing, but merely held it up toToby, who started at this undeniable evidence of the vicinity ofthe savages.</p><p> The plot was now thickening.--A short distance further lay alittle faggot of the same shoots bound together with a strip ofbark.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it have been thrown down by some solitary native,who, alarmed at seeing us, had hurried forward to carry thetidings of our approach to his countrymen?--Typee or Happar?--Butit was too late to recede, so we moved on slowly, my companion inadvance casting eager glances under the trees on each side, untilall at once I saw him recoil as if stung by an adder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking onhis knee, he waved me off with one hand, while with the other heheld aside some intervening leaves, and gazed intently at someobject.</p><p> Disregarding his injunction, I quickly approached him and caughta glimpse of two figures partly hidden by the dense foliage; theywere standing close together, and were perfectly motionless.&nbsp;&nbsp;They must have previously perceived us, and withdrawn into thedepths of the wood to elude our observation.</p><p> My mind was at once made up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropping my staff, and tearing openthe package of things we had brought from the ship, I unrolledthe cotton cloth, and holding it in one hand picked with theother a twig from the bushes beside me, and telling Toby tofollow my example, I broke through the covert and advanced,waving the branch in token of peace towards the shrinking formsbefore me.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were a boy and a girl, slender and graceful, andcompletely naked, with the exception of a slight girdle of bark,from which depended at opposite points two of the russet leavesof the bread-fruit tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;An arm of the boy, half screened fromsight by her wild tresses, was thrown about the neck of the girl,while with the other he held one of her hands in his; and thusthey stood together, their heads inclined forward, catching thefaint noise we made in our progress, and with one foot inadvance, as if half inclined to fly from our presence.</p><p> As we drew near, their alarm evidently increased.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprehensivethat they might fly from us altogether, I stopped short andmotioned them to advance and receive the gift I extended towardsthem, but they would not; I then uttered a few words of theirlanguage with which I was acquainted, scarcely expected that theywould understand me, but to show that we had not dropped from theclouds upon them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeared to give them a littleconfidence, so I approached nearer, presenting the cloth with onehand, and holding the bough with the other, while they slowlyretreated.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last they suffered us to approach so near to themthat we were enabled to throw the cotton cloth across theirshoulders, giving them to understand that it was theirs, and by avariety of gestures endeavouring to make them understand that weentertained the highest possible regard for them.</p><p> The frightened pair now stood still, whilst we endeavoured tomake them comprehend the nature of our wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing this Tobywent through with a complete series of pantomimicillustrations--opening his mouth from ear to ear, and thrustinghis fingers down his throat, gnashing his teeth and rolling hiseyes about, till I verily believe the poor creatures took us fora couple of white cannibals who were about to make a meal ofthem.&nbsp;&nbsp;When, however, they understood us, they showed noinclination to relieve our wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture it began torain violently, and we motioned them to lead us to some place ofshelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this request they appeared willing to comply, butnothing could evince more strongly the apprehension with whichthey regarded us, than the way in which, whilst walking beforeus, they kept their eyes constantly turned back to watch everymovement&nbsp;&nbsp;we made, and even our very looks.</p><p> 'Typee or Happar, Toby?'&nbsp;&nbsp;asked I as we walked after them.</p><p> 'Of course Happar,' he replied, with a show of confidence whichwas intended to disguise his doubts.</p><p> 'We shall soon know,' I exclaimed; and at the same moment Istepped forward towards our guides, and pronouncing the two namesinterrogatively and pointing to the lowest part of the valley,endeavoured to come to the point at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;They repeated thewords after me again and again, but without giving any peculiaremphasis to either, so that I was completely at a loss tounderstand them; for a couple of wilier young things than weafterwards found them to have been on this particular occasionnever probably fell in any traveller's way.</p><p> More and more curious to ascertain our fate, I now threw togetherin the form of a question the words 'Happar' and 'Motarkee', thelatter being equivalent to the word 'good'.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two nativesinterchanged glances of peculiar meaning with one another atthis, and manifested no little surprise; but on the repetition ofthe question after some consultation together, to the great joyof Toby, they answered in the affirmative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby was now inecstasies, especially as the young savages continued to reiteratetheir answer with great energy, as though desirous of impressingus with the idea that being among the Happars, we ought toconsider ourselves perfectly secure.</p><p> Although I had some lingering doubts, I feigned great delightwith Toby at this announcement, while my companion broke out intoa pantomimic abhorrence of Typee, and immeasurable love for theparticular valley in which we were; our guides all the whilegazing uneasily at one another as if at a loss to account for ourconduct.</p><p> They hurried on, and we followed them; until suddenly they set upa strange halloo, which was answered from beyond the grovethrough which we were passing, and the next moment we enteredupon some open ground, at the extremity of which we descried along, low hut, and in front of it were several young girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoon as they perceived us they fled with wild screams into theadjoining thickets, like so many startled fawns.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few momentsafter the whole valley resounded with savage outcries, and thenatives came running towards us from every direction.</p><p> Had an army of invaders made an irruption into their territorythey could not have evinced greater excitement.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were sooncompletely encircled by a dense throng, and in their eager desireto behold us they almost arrested our progress; an equal numbersurrounded our youthful guides, who with amazing volubilityappeared to be detailing the circumstances which had attendedtheir meeting with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every item of intelligence appeared toredouble the astonishment of the islanders, and they gazed at uswith inquiring looks.</p><p> At last we reached a large and handsome building of bamboos, andwere by signs told to enter it, the natives opening a lane for usthrough which to pass; on entering without ceremony, we threw ourexhausted frames upon the mats that covered the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;In amoment the slight tenement was completely full of people, whilstthose who were unable to obtain admittance gazed at us throughits open cane-work.</p><p> It was now evening, and by the dim light we could just discernthe savage countenances around us, gleaming with wild curiosityand wonder; the naked forms and tattooed limbs of brawnywarriors, with here and there the slighter figures of younggirls, all engaged in a perfect storm of conversation, of whichwe were of course the one only theme, whilst our recent guideswere fully occupied in answering the innumerable questions whichevery one put to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing can exceed the fiercegesticulation of these people when animated in conversation, andon this occasion they gave loose to all their natural vivacity,shouting and dancing about in a manner that well nigh intimidatedus.</p><p> Close to where we lay, squatting upon their haunches, were someeight or ten noble-looking chiefs--for such they subsequentlyproved to be--who, more reserved than the rest, regarded us witha fixed and stern attention, which not a little discomposed ourequanimity.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them in particular, who appeared to be thehighest in rank, placed himself directly facing me, looking at mewith a rigidity of aspect under which I absolutely quailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Henever once opened his lips, but maintained his severe expressionof countenance, without turning his face aside for a singlemoment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Never before had I been subjected to so strange andsteady a glance; it revealed nothing of the mind of the savage,but it appeared to be reading my own.</p><p> After undergoing this scrutiny till I grew absolutely nervous,with a view of diverting it if possible, and conciliating thegood opinion of the warrior, I took some tobacco from the bosomof my frock and offered it to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly rejected theproffered gift, and, without speaking, motioned me to return itto its place.</p><p> In my previous intercourse with the natives of Nukuheva and Tior,I had found that the present of a small piece of tobacco wouldhave rendered any of them devoted to my service.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this act ofthe chief a token of his enmity?&nbsp;&nbsp;Typee or Happar?&nbsp;&nbsp;I askedwithin myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;I started, for at the same moment this identicalquestion was asked by the strange being before me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned toToby, the flickering light of a native taper showed me hiscountenance pale with trepidation at this fatal question.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ipaused for a second, and I know not by what impulse it was that Ianswered 'Typee'.&nbsp;&nbsp;The piece of dusky statuary nodded inapproval, and then murmured 'Motarkee!'&nbsp;&nbsp;'Motarkee,' said I,without further hesitation 'Typee motarkee.'</p><p> What a transition!&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark figures around us leaped to theirfeet, clapped their hands in transport, and shouted again andagain the talismanic syllables, the utterance of which appearedto have settled everything.</p><p> When this commotion had a little subsided, the principal chiefsquatted once more before me, and throwing himself into a suddenrage, poured forth a string of philippics, which I was at no lossto understand, from the frequent recurrence of the word Happar,as being directed against the natives of the adjoining valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these denunciations my companion and I acquiesced, whilewe extolled the character of the warlike Typees.&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure ourpanegyrics were somewhat laconic, consisting in the repetition ofthat name, united with the potent adjective 'motarkee'.&nbsp;&nbsp;But thiswas sufficient, and served to conciliate the good will of thenatives, with whom our congeniality of sentiment on this pointdid more towards inspiring a friendly feeling than anything elsethat could have happened.</p><p> At last the wrath of the chief evaporated, and in a few momentshe was as placid as ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laying his hand upon his breast, hegave me to understand that his name was 'Mehevi', and that, inreturn, he wished me to communicate my appellation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hesitatedfor an instant, thinking that it might be difficult for him topronounce my real name, and then with the most praiseworthyintentions intimated that I was known as 'Tom'.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I could nothave made a worse selection; the chief could not master it.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tommo,' 'Tomma', 'Tommee', everything but plain 'Tom'.&nbsp;&nbsp;As hepersisted in garnishing the, word with an additional syllable, Icompromised the matter with him at the word 'Tommo'; and by thatname I went during the entire period of my stay in the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same proceeding was gone through with Toby, whose mellifluousappellation was more easily caught.</p><p> An exchange of names is equivalent to a ratification of good willand amity among these simple people; and as we were aware of thisfact, we were delighted that it had taken place on the presentoccasion.</p><p> Reclining upon our mats, we now held a kind of levee, givingaudience to successive troops of the natives, who introducedthemselves to us by pronouncing their respective names, andretired in high good humour on receiving ours in return.&nbsp;&nbsp;Duringthis ceremony the greatest merriment prevailed nearly everyannouncement on the part of the islanders being followed by afresh sally of gaiety, which induced me to believe that some ofthem at least were innocently diverting the company at ourexpense, by bestowing upon themselves a string of absurd titles,of the humour of which we were of course entirely ignorant.</p><p> All this occupied about an hour, when the throng having a littlediminished, I turned to Mehevi and gave him to understand that wewere in need of food and sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately the attentive chiefaddressed a few words to one of the crowd, who disappeared, andreturned in a few moments with a calabash of 'poee-poee', and twoor three young cocoanuts stripped of their husks, and with theirshells partly broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;We both of us forthwith placed one ofthese natural goblets to our lips, and drained it in a moment ofthe refreshing draught it contained.&nbsp;&nbsp;The poee-poee was thenplaced before us, and even famished as I was, I paused toconsider in what manner to convey it to my mouth.</p><p> This staple article of food among the Marquese islanders ismanufactured from the produce of the bread-fruit tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Itsomewhat resembles in its plastic nature our bookbinders' paste,is of a yellow colour, and somewhat tart to the taste.</p><p> Such was the dish, the merits of which I was now eager todiscuss.&nbsp;&nbsp;I eyed it wistfully for a moment, and then, unable anylonger to stand on ceremony, plunged my hand into the yieldingmass, and to the boisterous mirth of the natives drew it forthladen with the poee-poee, which adhered in lengthy strings toevery finger.&nbsp;&nbsp;So stubborn was its consistency, that in conveyingmy heavily-weighted hand to my mouth, the connecting links almostraised the calabash from the mats on which it had been placed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This display of awkwardness--in which, by-the-bye, Toby kept mecompany--convulsed the bystanders with uncontrollable laughter.</p><p> As soon as their merriment had somewhat subsided, Mehevi,motioning us to be attentive, dipped the forefinger of his righthand in the dish, and giving it a rapid and scientific twirl,drew it out coated smoothly with the preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a secondpeculiar flourish he prevented the poee-poee from dropping to theground as he raised it to his mouth, into which the finger wasinserted and drawn forth perfectly free from any adhesive matter.</p><p> This performance was evidently intended for our instruction; so Iagain essayed the feat on the principles inculcated, but withvery ill success.</p><p> A starving man, however, little heeds conventional proprieties,especially on a South-Sea Island, and accordingly Toby and Ipartook of the dish after our own clumsy fashion, beplasteringour faces all over with the glutinous compound, and daubing ourhands nearly to the wrist.&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of food is by no meansdisagreeable to the palate of a European, though at first themode of eating it may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my own part, after the lapse of afew days I became accustomed to its singular flavour, and grewremarkably fond of it.</p><p> So much for the first course; several other dishes followed it,some of which were positively delicious.&nbsp;&nbsp;We concluded ourbanquet by tossing off the contents of two more young cocoanuts,after which we regaled ourselves with the soothing fumes oftobacco, inhaled from a quaintly carved pipe which passed roundthe circle.</p><p> During the repast, the natives eyed us with intense curiosity,observing our minutest motions, and appearing to discoverabundant matter for comment in the most trifling occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their surprise mounted the highest, when we began to remove ouruncomfortable garments, which were saturated with rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theyscanned the whiteness of our limbs, and seemed utterly unable toaccount for the contrast they presented to the swarthy hue of ourfaces embrowned from a six months' exposure to the scorching sunof the Line.&nbsp;&nbsp;They felt our skin, much in the same way that asilk mercer would handle a remarkably fine piece of satin; andsome of them went so far in their investigation as to apply theolfactory organ.</p><p> Their singular behaviour almost led me to imagine that they neverbefore had beheld a white man; but a few moments' reflectionconvinced me that this could not have been the case; and a moresatisfactory reason for their conduct has since suggested itselfto my mind.</p><p> Deterred by the frightful stories related of its inhabitants,ships never enter this bay, while their hostile relations withthe tribes in the adjoining valleys prevent the Typees fromvisiting that section of the island where vessels occasionallylie.&nbsp;&nbsp;At long intervals, however, some intrepid captain willtouch on the skirts of the bay, with two or three armed boats'crews and accompanied by interpreters.&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives who live nearthe sea descry the strangers long before they reach their waters,and aware of the purpose for which they come, proclaim loudly thenews of their approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;By a species of vocal telegraph theintelligence reaches the inmost recesses of the vale in aninconceivably short space of time, drawing nearly its wholepopulation down to the beach laden with every variety of fruit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpreter, who is invariably a 'tabooed Kanaka'*, leapsashore with the goods intended for barter, while the boats, withtheir oars sloped, and every man on his thwart, lie just outsidethe surf, heading off the shore, in readiness at the firstuntoward event to escape to the open sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the trafficis concluded, one of the boats pulls in under cover of themuskets of the others, the fruit is quickly thrown into her, andthe transient visitors precipitately retire from what they justlyconsider so dangerous a vicinity.</p><p> * The word 'Kanaka' is at the present day universally used in theSouth Seas by Europeans to designate the Islanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;In thevarious dialects of the principal groups it is simply a sexualdesignation applied to the males; but it is now used by thenatives in their intercourse with foreigners in the same sense inwhich the latter employ it.</p><p> A 'Tabooed Kanaka' is an islander whose person has been made to acertain extent sacred by the operation of a singular customhereafter to be explained.</p><p> </p><p> The intercourse occurring with Europeans being so restricted, nowonder that the inhabitants of the valley manifested so muchcuriosity with regard to us, appearing as we did among them undersuch singular circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that we were thefirst white men who ever penetrated thus far back into theirterritories, or at least the first who had ever descended fromthe head of the vale.&nbsp;&nbsp;What had brought us thither must haveappeared a complete mystery to them, and from our ignorance ofthe language it was impossible for us to enlighten them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inanswer to inquiries which the eloquence of their gestures enabledus to comprehend, all that we could reply was, that we had comefrom Nukuheva, a place, be it remembered, with which they were atopen war.&nbsp;&nbsp;This intelligence appeared to affect them with themost lively emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nukuheva motarkee?'&nbsp;&nbsp;they asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofcourse we replied most energetically in the negative.</p><p> Then they plied us with a thousand questions, of which we couldunderstand nothing more than that they had reference to therecent movements of the French, against whom they seemed tocherish the most fierce hatred.&nbsp;&nbsp;So eager were they to obtaininformation on this point, that they still continued to propoundtheir queries long after we had shown that we were utterly unableto answer them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally we caught some indistinct idea oftheir meaning, when we would endeavour by every method in ourpower to communicate the desired intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;At such timestheir gratification was boundless, and they would redouble theirefforts to make us comprehend them more perfectly.&nbsp;&nbsp;But all invain; and in the end they looked at us despairingly, as if wewere the receptacles of invaluable information; but how to comeat it they knew not.</p><p> After a while the group around us gradually dispersed, and wewere left about midnight (as we conjectured) with those whoappeared to be permanent residents of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theseindividuals now provided us with fresh mats to lie upon, coveredus with several folds of tappa, and then extinguishing the tapersthat had been burning, threw themselves down beside us, and aftera little desultory conversation were soon sound asleep.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Eleven</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p> MIDNIGHT REFLECTIONS--MORNING VISITORS--A WARRIOR IN COSTUME--ASAVAGE AESCULAPIUS--PRACTICE OF THE HEALING ART--BODY SERVANT--ADWELLING-HOUSE OF THE VALLEY DESCRIBED--PORTRAITS OF ITS INMATES</p><p> VARIOUS and conflicting were the thoughts which oppressed meduring the silent hours that followed the events related in thepreceding chapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby, wearied with the fatigues of the day,slumbered heavily by my side; but the pain under which I wassuffering effectually prevented my sleeping, and I remaineddistressingly alive to all the fearful circumstances of ourpresent situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it possible that, after all ourvicissitudes, we were really in the terrible valley of Typee, andat the mercy of its inmates, a fierce and unrelenting tribe ofsavages?&nbsp;&nbsp;Typee or Happar?&nbsp;&nbsp;I shuddered when I reflected thatthere was no longer any room for doubt; and that, beyond all hopeof escape, we were now placed in those very circumstances fromthe bare thought of which I had recoiled with such abhorrence buta few days before.&nbsp;&nbsp;What might not be our fearful destiny?&nbsp;&nbsp;To besure, as yet we had been treated with no violence; nay, had beeneven kindly and hospitably entertained.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what dependencecould be placed upon the fickle passions which sway the bosom ofa savage?&nbsp;&nbsp;His inconstancy and treachery are proverbial.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mightit not be that beneath these fair appearances the islanderscovered some perfidious design, and that their friendly receptionof us might only precede some horrible catastrophe?&nbsp;&nbsp;How stronglydid these forebodings spring up in my mind as I lay restlesslyupon a couch of mats surrounded by the dimly revealed forms ofthose whom I so greatly dreaded!</p><p> From the excitement of these fearful thoughts I sank towardsmorning into an uneasy slumber; and on awaking, with a start, inthe midst of an appalling dream, looked up into the eagercountenance of a number of the natives, who were bending over me.</p><p> It was broad day; and the house was nearly filled with youngfemales, fancifully decorated with flowers, who gazed upon me asI rose with faces in which childish delight and curiosity werevividly portrayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;After waking Toby, they seated themselvesround us on the mats, and gave full play to that pryinginquisitiveness which time out of mind has been attributed to theadorable sex.</p><p> As these unsophisticated young creatures were attended by nojealous duennas, their proceedings were altogether informal, andvoid of artificial restraint.&nbsp;&nbsp;Long and minute was theinvestigation with which they honoured us, and so uproarioustheir mirth, that I felt infinitely sheepish; and Toby wasimmeasurably outraged at their familiarity.</p><p> These lively young ladies were at the same time wonderfullypolite and humane; fanning aside the insects that occasionallylighted on our brows; presenting us with food; andcompassionately regarding me in the midst of my afflictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Butin spite of all their blandishments, my feelings of proprietywere exceedingly shocked, for I could but consider them as havingoverstepped the due limits of female decorum.</p><p> Having diverted themselves to their hearts' content, our youngvisitants now withdrew, and gave place to successive troops ofthe other sex, who continued flocking towards the house untilnear noon; by which time I have no doubt that the greater part ofthe inhabitants of the valley had bathed themselves in the lightof our benignant countenances.</p><p> At last, when their numbers began to diminish, a superb-lookingwarrior stooped the towering plumes of his head-dress&nbsp;&nbsp;beneaththe low portal, and entered the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw at once that he wassome distinguished personage, the natives regarding him with theutmost deference, and making room for him as he approached.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hisaspect was imposing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendid long drooping tail-feathers ofthe tropical bird, thickly interspersed with the gaudy plumage ofthe cock, were disposed in an immense upright semicircle upon hishead, their lower extremities being fixed in a crescent ofguinea-heads which spanned the forehead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Around his neck wereseveral enormous necklaces of boar's tusks, polished like ivory,and disposed in such a manner as that the longest and largestwere upon his capacious chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust forward through the largeapertures in his ears were two small and finely-shaped spermwhale teeth, presenting their cavities in front, stuffed withfreshly-plucked leaves, and curiously wrought at the other endinto strange little images and devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;These barbaric trinkets,garnished in this manner at their open extremities, and taperingand curving round to a point behind the ear, resembled not alittle a pair of cornucopias.</p><p> The loins of the warrior were girt about with heavy folds of adark-coloured tappa, hanging before and behind in clusters ofbraided tassels, while anklets and bracelets of curling humanhair completed his unique costume.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his right hand he graspeda beautifully carved paddle-spear, nearly fifteen feet in length,made of the bright koar-wood, one end sharply pointed, and theother flattened like an oar-blade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging obliquely from hisgirdle by a loop of sinnate was a richly decorated pipe; theslender reed forming its stem was coloured with a red pigment,and round it, as well as the idol-bowl, fluttered littlestreamers of the thinnest tappa.</p><p> But that which was most remarkable in the appearance of thissplendid islander was the elaborate tattooing displayed on everynoble limb.&nbsp;&nbsp;All imaginable lines and curves and figures weredelineated over his whole body, and in their grotesque varietyand infinite profusion I could only compare them to the crowdedgroupings of quaint patterns we sometimes see in costly pieces oflacework.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most simple and remarkable of all these ornamentswas that which decorated the countenance of the chief.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two broadstripes of tattooing, diverging from the centre of his shavencrown, obliquely crossed both eyes--staining the lids--to alittle below each ear, where they united with another stripewhich swept in a straight line along the lips and formed the baseof the triangle.&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior, from the excellence of hisphysical proportions, might certainly have been regarded as oneof Nature's noblemen, and the lines drawn upon his face maypossibly have denoted his exalted rank.</p><p> This warlike personage, upon entering the house, seated himselfat some distance from the spot where Toby and myself reposed,while the rest of the savages looked alternately from us to him,as if in expectation of something they were disappointed in notperceiving.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the chief attentively, I thought hislineaments appeared familiar to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as his full face wasturned upon me, and I again beheld its extraordinaryembellishment, and met the strange gaze to which I had beensubjected the preceding night, I immediately, in spite of thealteration in his appearance, recognized the noble Mehevi.&nbsp;&nbsp;Onaddressing him, he advanced at once in the most cordial manner,and greeting me warmly, seemed to enjoy not a little the effecthis barbaric costume had produced upon me.</p><p> I forthwith determined to secure, if possible, the good-will ofthis individual, as I easily perceived he was a man of greatauthority in his tribe, and one who might exert a powerfulinfluence upon our subsequent fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the endeavour I was notrepulsed; for nothing could surpass the friendliness hemanifested towards both my companion and myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;He extended hissturdy limbs by our side, and endeavoured to make us comprehendthe full extent of the kindly feelings by which he was actuated.&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost insuperable difficulty in communicating to one anotherour ideas affected the chief with no little mortification.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heevinced a great desire to be enlightened with regard to thecustoms and peculiarities of the far-off country we had leftbehind us, and to which under the name of Maneeka he frequentlyalluded.</p><p> But that which more than any other subject engaged his attentionwas the late proceedings of the 'Frannee' as he called theFrench, in the neighbouring bay of Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;This seemed anever-ending theme with him, and one concerning which he wasnever weary of interrogating us.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the information wesucceeded in imparting to him on this subject was little morethan that we had seen six men-of-war lying in the hostile bay atthe time we had left it.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he received this intelligence,Mehevi, by the aid of his fingers, went through a long numericalcalculation, as if estimating the number of Frenchmen thesquadron might contain.</p><p> It was just after employing his faculties in this way that hehappened to notice the swelling in my limb.&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediatelyexamined it with the utmost attention, and after doing so,despatched a boy who happened to be standing by with somemessage.</p><p> After the lapse of a few moments the stripling re-entered thehouse with an aged islander, who might have been taken for oldHippocrates himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;His head was as bald as the polishedsurface of a cocoanut shell, which article it precisely resembledin smoothness and colour, while a long silvery beard swept almostto his girdle of bark.&nbsp;&nbsp;Encircling his temples was a bandeau ofthe twisted leaves of the Omoo tree, pressed closely over thebrows to shield his feeble vision from the glare of the sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Histottering steps were supported by a long slim staff, resemblingthe wand with which a theatrical magician appears on the stage,and in one hand he carried a freshly plaited fan of the greenleaflets of the cocoanut tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;A flowing robe of tappa, knottedover the shoulder, hung loosely round his stooping form, andheightened the venerableness of his aspect.</p><p> Mehevi, saluting this old gentleman, motioned him to a seatbetween us, and then uncovering my limb, desired him to examineit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The leech gazed intently from me to Toby, and then proceededto business.&nbsp;&nbsp;After diligently observing the ailing member, hecommenced manipulating it; and on the supposition probably thatthe complaint had deprived the leg of all sensation, began topinch and hammer it in such a manner that I absolutely roaredwith pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that I was as capable of making anapplication of thumps and pinches to the part as any one else, Iendeavoured to resist this species of medical treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;But itwas not so easy a matter to get out of the clutches of the oldwizard; he fastened on the unfortunate limb as if it weresomething for which he had been long seeking, and muttering somekind of incantation continued his discipline, pounding it after afashion that set me well nigh crazy; while Mehevi, upon the sameprinciple which prompts an affectionate mother to hold astruggling child in a dentist's chair, restrained me in hispowerful grasp, and actually encouraged the wretch in thisinfliction of torture.</p><p> Almost frantic with rage and pain, I yelled like a bedlamite;while Toby, throwing himself into all the attitudes of aposture-master, vainly endeavoured to expostulate with thenatives by signs and gestures.&nbsp;&nbsp;To have looked at my companion,as, sympathizing with my sufferings, he strove to put an end tothem, one would have thought that he was the deaf and dumbalphabet incarnated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether my tormentor yielded to Toby'sentreaties, or paused from sheer exhaustion, I do not know; butall at once he ceased his operations, and at the same time thechief relinquishing his hold upon me, I fell back, faint andbreathless with the agony I had endured.</p><p> My unfortunate limb was now left much in the same condition as arump-steak after undergoing the castigating process whichprecedes cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp;My physician, having recovered from thefatigues of his exertions, as if anxious to make amends for thepain to which he had subjected me, now took some herbs out of alittle wallet that was suspended from his waist, and moisteningthem in water, applied them to the inflamed part, stooping overit at the same time, and either whispering a spell, or having alittle confidential chat with some imaginary demon located in thecalf of my leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;My limb was now swathed in leafy bandages, andgrateful to Providence for the cessation of hostilities, I wassuffered to rest.</p><p> Mehevi shortly after rose to depart; but before he went he spokeauthoritatively to one of the natives whom he addressed asKory-Kory; and from the little I could understand of what tookplace, pointed him out to me as a man whose peculiar businessthenceforth would be to attend upon my person.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not certainthat I comprehended as much as this at the time, but thesubsequent conduct of my trusty body-servant fully assured methat such must have been the case.</p><p> I could not but be amused at the manner in which the chiefaddressed me upon this occasion, talking to me for at leastfifteen or twenty minutes as calmly as if I could understandevery word that he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remarked this peculiarity very oftenafterwards in many other of the islanders.</p><p> Mehevi having now departed, and the family physician havinglikewise made his exit, we were left about sunset with ten ortwelve natives, who by this time I had ascertained composed thehousehold of which Toby and I were members.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the dwelling towhich we had been first introduced was the place of my permanentabode while I remained in the valley, and as I was necessarilyplaced upon the most intimate footing with its occupants, I mayas well here enter into a little description of it and itsinhabitants.&nbsp;&nbsp;This description will apply also to nearly all theother dwelling-places in the vale, and will furnish some idea ofthe generality of the natives.</p><p> Near one side of the valley, and about midway up the ascent of arather abrupt rise of ground waving with the richest verdure, anumber of large stones were laid in successive courses, to theheight of nearly eight feet, and disposed in such a manner thattheir level surface corresponded in shape with the habitationwhich was perched upon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;A narrow space, however, was reservedin front of the dwelling, upon the summit of this pile of stones(called by the natives a 'pi-pi'), which being enclosed by alittle picket of canes, gave it somewhat the appearance of averandah.&nbsp;&nbsp;The frame of the house was constructed of largebamboos planted uprightly, and secured together at intervals bytransverse stalks of the light wood of the habiscus, lashed withthongs of bark.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear of the tenement--built up withsuccessive ranges of cocoanut boughs bound one upon another, withtheir leaflets cunningly woven together--inclined a little fromthe vertical, and extended from the extreme edge of the 'pi-pi'to about twenty feet from its surface; whence the shelvingroof--thatched with the long tapering leaves of thepalmetto--sloped steeply off to within about five feet of thefloor; leaving the eaves drooping with tassel-like appendagesover the front of the habitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was constructed of lightand elegant canes in a kind of open screenwork, tastefullyadorned with bindings of variegated sinnate, which served to holdtogether its various parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sides of the house weresimilarly built; thus presenting three quarters for thecirculation of the air, while the whole was impervious to therain.</p><p> In length this picturesque building was perhaps twelve yards,while in breadth it could not have exceeded as many feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somuch for the exterior; which, with its wire-like reed-twistedsides, not a little reminded me of an immense aviary.</p><p> Stooping a little, you passed.&nbsp;&nbsp;through a narrow aperture in itsfront; and facing you, on entering, lay two long, perfectlystraight, and well-polished trunks of the cocoanut tree,extending the full length of the dwelling; one of them placedclosely against the rear, and the other lying parallel with itsome two yards distant, the interval between them being spreadwith a multitude of gaily-worked mats, nearly all of a differentpattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;This space formed the common couch and lounging placeof the natives, answering the purpose of a divan in Orientalcountries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here would they slumber through the hours of thenight, and recline luxuriously during the greater part of theday.&nbsp;&nbsp;The remainder of the floor presented only the cool shiningsurfaces of the large stones of which the 'pi-pi' was composed.</p><p> From the ridge-pole of the house hung suspended a number of largepackages enveloped in coarse tappa; some of which containedfestival dresses, and various other matters of the wardrobe, heldin high estimation.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were easily accessible by means of aline, which, passing over the ridge-pole, had one end attached toa bundle, while with the other, which led to the side of thedwelling and was there secured, the package could be lowered orelevated at pleasure.</p><p> Against the farther wall of the house were arranged in tastefulfigures a variety of spears and javelins, and other implements ofsavage warfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of the habitation, and built upon thepiazza-like area in its front, was a little shed used as a sortof larder or pantry, and in which were stored various articles ofdomestic use and convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few yards from the pi-pi was alarge shed built of cocoanut boughs, where the process ofpreparing the 'poee-poee' was carried on, and all culinaryoperations attended to.</p><p> Thus much for the house, and its appurtenances; and it will bereadily acknowledged that a more commodious and appropriatedwelling for the climate and the people could not possibly bedevised.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was cool, free to admit the air, scrupulously clean,and elevated above the dampness and impurities of the ground.</p><p> But now to sketch the inmates; and here I claim for my triedservitor and faithful valet Kory-Kory the precedence of a firstdescription.&nbsp;&nbsp;As his character will be gradually unfolded in thecourse of my narrative, I shall for the present content myselfwith delineating his personal appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kory-Kory, though themost devoted and best natured serving-man in the world, was,alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;a hideous object to look upon.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was some twenty-fiveyears of age, and about six feet in height, robust and well made,and of the most extraordinary aspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;His head was carefullyshaven with the exception of two circular spots, about the sizeof a dollar, near the,top of the cranium, where the hair,permitted to grow of an amazing length, was twisted up in twoprominent knots, that gave him the appearance of being decoratedwith a pair of horns.&nbsp;&nbsp;His beard, plucked out by the root fromevery other part of his face, was suffered to droop in hairypendants, two of which garnished his under lip, and an equalnumber hung from the extremity of his chin.</p><p> Kory-Kory, with a view of improving the handiwork of nature, andperhaps prompted by a desire to add to the engaging expression ofhis countenance, had seen fit to embellish his face with threebroad longitudinal stripes of tattooing, which, like thosecountry roads that go straight forward in defiance of allobstacles, crossed his nasal organ, descended into the hollow ofhis eyes, and even skirted the borders of his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eachcompletely spanned his physiognomy; one extending in a line withhis eyes, another crossing the face in the vicinity of the nose,and the third sweeping along his lips from ear to ear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiscountenance thus triply hooped, as it were, with tattooing,always reminded me of those unhappy wretches whom I havesometimes observed gazing out sentimentally from behind thegrated bars of a prison window; whilst the entire body of mysavage valet, covered all over with representations of birds andfishes, and a variety of most unaccountable-looking creatures,suggested to me the idea of a pictorial museum of naturalhistory, or an illustrated copy of 'Goldsmith's Animated Nature.'</p><p> But it seems really heartless in me to write thus of the poorislander, when I owe perhaps to his unremitting attentions thevery existence I now enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kory-Kory, I mean thee no harm inwhat I say in regard to thy outward adornings; but they were alittle curious to my unaccustomed sight, and therefore I dilateupon them.&nbsp;&nbsp;But to underrate or forget thy faithful services issomething I could never be guilty of, even in the giddiest momentof my life.</p><p> The father of my attached follower was a native of giganticframe, and had once possessed prodigious physical powers; but thelofty form was now yielding to the inroads of time, though thehand of disease seemed never to have been laid upon the agedwarrior.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marheyo--for such was his name--appeared to haveretired from all active participation in the affairs of thevalley, seldom or never accompanying the natives in their variousexpeditions; and employing the greater part of his time inthrowing up a little shed just outside the house, upon which hewas engaged to my certain knowledge for four months, withoutappearing to make any sensible advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose the oldgentleman was in his dotage, for he manifested in various waysthe characteristics which mark this particular stage of life.</p><p> I remember in particular his having a choice pair ofear-ornaments, fabricated from the teeth of some sea-monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;These he would alternately wear and take off at least fifty timesin the course of the day, going and coming from his little hut oneach occasion with all the tranquillity imaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimesslipping them through the slits in his ears, he would seize hisspear--which in length and slightness resembled afishing-pole--and go stalking beneath the shadows of theneighbouring groves, as if about to give a hostile meeting tosome cannibal knight.&nbsp;&nbsp;But he would soon return again, and hidinghis weapon under the projecting eaves of the house, and rollinghis clumsy trinkets carefully in a piece of tappa, would resumehis more pacific operations as quietly as if he had neverinterrupted them.</p><p> But despite his eccentricities, Marheyo was a most paternal andwarm-hearted old fellow, and in this particular not a littleresembled his son Kory-Kory.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother of the latter was themistress of the family, and a notable housewife, and a mostindustrious old lady she was.&nbsp;&nbsp;If she did not understand the artof making jellies, jams, custard, tea-cakes, and such like trashyaffairs, she was profoundly skilled in the mysteries of preparing'amar', 'poee-poee', and 'kokoo', with other substantial matters.</p><p> She was a genuine busy-body; bustling about the house like acountry landlady at an unexpected arrival; for ever giving theyoung girls tasks to perform, which the little hussies as oftenneglected; poking into every corner, and rummaging over bundlesof old tappa, or making a prodigious clatter among thecalabashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes she might have been seen squatting uponher haunches in front of a huge wooden basin, and kneadingpoee-poee with terrific vehemence, dashing the stone pestle aboutas if she would shiver the vessel into fragments; on otheroccasions, galloping about the valley in search of a particularkind of leaf, used in some of her recondite operations, andreturning home, toiling and sweating, with a bundle of it, underwhich most women would have sunk.</p><p> To tell the truth, Kory-Kory's mother was the only industriousperson in all the valley of Typee; and she could not haveemployed herself more actively had she been left an exceedinglymuscular and destitute widow, with an inordinate ate supply ofyoung children, in the bleakest part of the civilized world.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not the slightest necessity for the greater portion ofthe labour performed by the old lady: but she seemed to work fromsome irresistible impulse; her limbs continually swaying to andfro, as if there were some indefatigable engine concealed withinher body which kept her in perpetual motion.</p><p> Never suppose that she was a termagant or a shrew for all this;she had the kindliest heart in the world, and acted towards me inparticular in a truly maternal manner, occasionally putting somelittle morsel of choice food,into my hand, some outlandish kindof savage sweetmeat or pastry, like a doting mother petting asickly urchin with tarts and sugar plums.&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm indeed are myremembrances of the dear, good, affectionate old Tinor!</p><p> Besides the individuals I have mentioned, there belonged to thehousehold three young men, dissipated, good-for-nothing,roystering blades of savages, who were either employed inprosecuting love affairs with the maidens of the tribe, or grewboozy on 'arva' and tobacco in the company of congenial spirits,the scapegraces of the valley.</p><p> Among the permanent inmates of the house were likewise severallovely damsels, who instead of thrumming pianos and readinghovels, like more enlightened young ladies, substituted for theseemployments the manufacture of a fine species of tappa; but forthe greater portion of the time were skipping from house tohouse, gadding and gossiping with their acquaintances.</p><p> From the rest of these, however, I must except the beauteousnymph Fayaway, who was my peculiar favourite.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her free pliantfigure was the very perfection of female grace and beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hercomplexion was a rich and mantling olive, and when watching theglow upon her cheeks I could almost swear that beneath thetransparent medium there lurked the blushes of a faint vermilion.</p><p> The face of this girl was a rounded oval, and each feature asperfectly formed as the heart or imagination of man could desire.</p><p> Her full lips, when parted with a smile, disclosed teeth ofdazzling whiteness and when her rosy mouth opened with a burst ofmerriment, they looked like the milk-white seeds of the 'arta,' afruit of the valley, which, when cleft in twain, shows themreposing in rows on each side, imbedded in the red and juicypulp.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair of the deepest brown, parted irregularly in themiddle, flowed in natural ringlets over her shoulders, andwhenever she chanced to stoop, fell over and hid from view herlovely bosom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing into the depths of her strange blue eyes,when she was in a contemplative mood, they seemed most placid yetunfathomable; but when illuminated by some lively emotion, theybeamed upon the beholder like stars.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands of Fayaway wereas soft and delicate as those of any countess; for an entireexemption from rude labour marks the girlhood and even prime of aTypee woman's life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her feet, though wholly exposed, were asdiminutive and fairly shaped as those which peep from beneath theskirts of a Lima lady's dress.&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin of this young creature,from continual ablutions and the use of mollifying ointments, wasinconceivably smooth and soft.</p><p> I may succeed, perhaps, in particularizing some of the individualfeatures of Fayaway's beauty, but that general loveliness ofappearance which they all contributed to produce I will notattempt to describe.&nbsp;&nbsp;The easy unstudied graces of a child ofnature like this, breathing from infancy an atmosphere ofperpetual summer, and nurtured by the simple fruits of the earth;enjoying a perfect freedom from care and anxiety, and removedeffectually from all injurious tendencies, strike the eye in amanner which cannot be pourtrayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This picture is no fancysketch; it is drawn from the most vivid recollections of theperson delineated.</p><p> Were I asked if the beauteous form of Fayaway was altogether freefrom the hideous blemish of tattooing, I should be constrained toanswer that it was not.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the practitioners of the barbarousart, so remorseless in their inflictions upon the brawny limbs ofthe warriors of the tribe, seem to be conscious that it needs notthe resources of their profession to augment the charms of themaidens of the vale.</p><p> The females are very little embellished in this way, and Fayaway,and all the other young girls of her age, were even less so thanthose of their sex more advanced in years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason of thispeculiarity will be alluded to hereafter.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the tattooing thatthe nymph in question exhibited upon her person may be easilydescribed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three minute dots, no bigger than pin-heads,decorated each lip, and at a little distance were not at alldiscernible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just upon the fall of the shoulder were drawn twoparallel lines half an inch apart, and perhaps three inches inlength, the interval being filled with delicately executedfigures.&nbsp;&nbsp;These narrow bands of tattooing, thus placed, alwaysreminded me of those stripes of gold lace worn by officers inundress, and which are in lieu of epaulettes to denote theirrank.</p><p> Thus much was Fayaway tattooed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The audacious hand which hadgone so far in its desecrating work stopping short, apparentlywanting the heart to proceed.</p><p> But I have omitted to describe the dress worn by this nymph ofthe valley.</p><p> Fayaway--I must avow the fact--for the most part clung to theprimitive and summer garb of Eden.&nbsp;&nbsp;But how becoming the costume!</p><p> It showed her fine figure to the best possible advantage; andnothing could have been better adapted to her peculiar style ofbeauty.&nbsp;&nbsp;On ordinary occasions she was habited precisely as Ihave described the two youthful savages whom we had met on firstentering the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;At other times, when rambling among thegroves, or visiting at the houses of her acquaintances, she worea tunic of white tappa, reaching from her waist to a little belowthe knees; and when exposed for any length of time to the sun,she invariably protected herself from its rays by a floatingmantle of--the same material, loosely gathered about the person.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gala dress will be described hereafter.</p><p> As the beauties of our own land delight in bedecking themselveswith fanciful articles of jewellery, suspending them from theirears, hanging them about their necks, and clasping them aroundtheir wrists; so Fayaway and her companions were in the habit ofornamenting themselves with similar appendages.</p><p> Flora was their jeweller.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes they wore necklaces of smallcarnation flowers, strung like rubies upon a fibre of tappa, ordisplayed in their ears a single white bud, the stem thrustbackward through the aperture, and showing in front the delicatepetals folded together in a beautiful sphere, and looking like adrop of the purest pearl.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaplets too, resembling in theirarrangement the strawberry coronal worn by an English peeress,and composed of intertwined leaves and blossoms, often crownedtheir temples; and bracelets and anklets of the same tastefulpattern were frequently to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the maidens of theisland were passionately fond of flowers, and never wearied ofdecorating their persons with them; a lovely trait in theircharacter, and one that ere long will be more fully alluded to.</p><p> Though in my eyes, at least, Fayaway was indisputably theloveliest female I saw in Typee, yet the description I have givenof her will in some measure apply to nearly all the youthfulportion of her sex in the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge ye then, reader, whatbeautiful creatures they must have been.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twelve</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER

TI--TIMEWORN SAVAGES--HOSPITALITY OF MEHEVI--MIDNIGHTMUSINGS--ADVENTURES IN THE DARK--DISTINGUISHED HONOURS PAID TOTHE VISITORS--STRANGE PROCESSION AND RETURN TO THE HOUSE OFMARHEYO</p><p> WHEN Mehevi had departed from the house, as related in thepreceding chapter, Kory-Kory commenced the functions of the postassigned him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought out, various kinds of food; and, as ifI were an infant, insisted upon feeding me with his own hands. To this procedure I, of course, most earnestly objected, but invain; and having laid a calabash of kokoo before me, he washedhis fingers in a vessel of water, and then putting his hands intothe dish and rolling the food into little balls, put them oneafter another into my mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;All my remonstrances against thismeasure only provoked so great a clamour on his part, that I wasobliged to acquiesce; and the operation of feeding being thusfacilitated, the meal was quickly despatched.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Toby, hewas allowed to help himself after his own fashion.</p><p> The repast over, my attendant arranged the mats for repose, and,bidding me lie down, covered me with a large robe of tappa, atthe same time looking approvingly upon me, and exclaiming 'Ki-Ki,nuee nuee, ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;moee moee motarkee' (eat plenty, ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep verygood).&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosophy of this sentiment I did not pretend toquestion; for deprived of sleep for several preceding nights, andthe pain of my limb having much abated, I now felt inclined toavail myself of the opportunity afforded me.</p><p> The next morning, on waking, I found Kory-Kory stretched out onone side of me, while my companion lay upon the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feltsensibly refreshed after a night of sound repose, and immediatelyagreed to the proposition of my valet that I should repair to thewater and wash, although dreading the suffering that the exertionmight produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;From this apprehension, however, I was quicklyrelieved; for Kory-Kory, leaping from the pi-pi, and then backinghimself up against it, like a porter in readiness to shoulder atrunk, with loud vociferations and a superabundance of gestures,gave me to understand that I was to mount upon his back and bethus transported to the stream, which flowed perhaps two hundredyards from the house.</p><p> Our appearance upon the verandah in front of the habitation drewtogether quite a crowd, who stood looking on and conversing withone another in the most animated manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;They reminded one of agroup of idlers gathered about the door of a village tavern whenthe equipage of some distinguished traveller is brought roundpreviously to his departure.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I clasped my arms aboutthe neck of the devoted fellow, and he jogged off with me, thecrowd--composed chiefly of young girls and boys--followed after,shouting and capering with infinite glee, and accompanied us tothe banks of the stream.</p><p> On gaining it, Kory-Kory, wading up to his hips in the water,carried me half way across, and deposited me on a smooth blackstone which rose a few inches above the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amphibiousrabble at our heels plunged in after us, and climbing to thesummit of the grass-grown rocks with which the bed of the brookwas here and there broken, waited curiously to witness ourmorning ablutions.</p><p> Somewhat embarrassed by the presence of the female portion of thecompany, and feeling my cheeks burning with bashful timidity, Iformed a primitive basin by joining my hands together, and cooledmy blushes in the water it contained; then removing my frock,bent over and washed myself down to my waist in the stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoon as Kory-Kory comprehended from my motions that this was tobe the extent of my performance, he appeared perfectly aghastwith astonishment, and rushing towards me, poured out a torrentof words in eager deprecation of so limited an operation,enjoining me by unmistakeable signs to immerse my whole body.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tothis I was forced to consent; and the honest fellow regarding meas a froward, inexperienced child, whom it was his duty to serveat the risk of offending, lifted me from the rocks, and tenderlybathed my limbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This over, and resuming my seat, I could notavoid bursting into admiration of the scene around me.</p><p> From the verdant surfaces of the large stones that lay scatteredabout, the natives were now sliding off into the water, divingand ducking beneath the surface in all directions--the younggirls springing buoyantly into the air, and revealing their nakedforms to the waist, with their long tresses dancing about theirshoulders, their eyes sparkling like drops of dew in the sun, andtheir gay laughter pealing forth at every frolicsome incident. On the afternoon of the day that I took my first bath in thevalley, we received another visit from Mehevi.&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble savageseemed to be in the same pleasant mood, and was quite as cordialin his manner as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;After remaining about an hour, he rosefrom the mats, and motioning to leave the house, invited Toby andmyself to accompany him.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pointed to my leg; but Mehevi in histurn pointed to Kory-Kory, and removed that objection; so,mounting upon the faithful fellow's shoulders again--like the oldman of the sea astride of Sindbad--I followed after the chief.</p><p> The nature of the route we now pursued struck me more forciblythan anything I had yet seen, as illustrating the indolentdisposition of the islanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The path was obviously the mostbeaten one in the valley, several others leading from each sideinto it, and perhaps for successive generations it had formed theprincipal avenue of the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, until I grew morefamiliar with its impediments, it seemed as difficult to travelas the recesses of a wilderness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of it swept around anabrupt rise.&nbsp;&nbsp;of ground, the surface of which was broken byfrequent inequalities, and thickly strewn with projecting massesof rocks, whose summits were often hidden from view by thedrooping foliage of the luxurious vegetation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes directlyover, sometimes evading these obstacles with a wide circuit, thepath wound along;--one moment climbing over a sudden eminencesmooth with continued wear, then descending on the other sideinto a steep glen, and crossing the flinty channel of a brook.Here it pursued the depths of a glade, occasionally obliging youto stoop beneath vast horizontal branches; and now you steppedover huge trunks and boughs that lay rotting across the track.</p><p> Such was the grand thoroughfare of Typee.&nbsp;&nbsp;After proceeding alittle distance along it--Kory-Kory panting and blowing with theweight of his burden--I dismounted from his back, and graspingthe long spear of Mehevi in my hand, assisted my steps over thenumerous obstacles of the road; preferring this mode of advanceto one which, from the difficulties of the way, was equallypainful to myself and my wearied servitor.</p><p> Our journey was soon at an end; for, scaling a sudden height, wecame abruptly upon the place of our destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that itwere possible to sketch in words this spot as vividly as Irecollect it.</p><p> Here were situated the Taboo groves of the valley--the scene ofmany a prolonged feast, of many a horrid rite.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the darkshadows of the consecrated bread-fruit trees there reigned asolemn twilight--a cathedral-like gloom.&nbsp;&nbsp;The frightful genius ofpagan worship seemed to brood in silence over the place,breathing its spell upon every object around.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here and there, inthe depths of these awful shades, half screened from sight bymasses of overhanging foliage, rose the idolatrous altars of thesavages, built of enormous blocks of black and polished stone,placed one upon another, without cement, to the height of twelveor fifteen feet, and surmounted by a rustic open temple, enclosedwith a low picket of canes, within which might be seen, invarious stages of decay, offerings of bread-fruit and cocoanuts,and the putrefying relics of some recent sacrifice.</p><p> In the midst of the wood was the hallowed 'Hoolah Hoolah'ground--set apart for the celebration of the fantasticalreligious ritual of these people--comprising an extensive oblongpi-pi, terminating at either end in a lofty terraced altar,guarded by ranks of hideous wooden idols, and with the tworemaining sides flanked by ranges of bamboo sheds, openingtowards the interior of the quadrangle thus formed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vast trees,standing in the middle of this space, and throwing over it anumbrageous shade, had their massive trunks built round withslight stages, elevated a few feet above the ground, and railedin with canes, forming so many rustic pulpits, from which thepriests harangued their devotees.</p><p> This holiest of spots was defended from profanation by thestrictest edicts of the all-pervading 'taboo', which condemned toinstant death the sacrilegious female who should enter or touchits sacred precincts, or even so much as press with her feet theground made holy by the shadows that it cast.</p><p> Access was had to the enclosure through an embowered entrance, onone side, facing a number of towering cocoanut trees, planted atintervals along a level area of a hundred yards.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the furtherextremity of this space was to be seen a building of considerablesize, reserved for the habitation of the priests and religiousattendants of the groves.</p><p> In its vicinity was another remarkable edifice, built as usualupon the summit of a pi-pi, and at least two hundred feet inlength, though not more than twenty in breadth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole frontof this latter structure was completely open, and from one end tothe other ran a narrow verandah, fenced in on the edge of thepi-pi with a picket of canes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its interior presented theappearance of an immense lounging place, the entire floor beingstrewn with successive layers of mats, lying between paralleltrunks of cocoanut trees, selected for the purpose from thestraightest and most symmetrical the vale afforded.</p><p> To this building, denominated in the language of the natives the'Ti', Mehevi now conducted us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far we had been accompaniedby a troop of the natives of both sexes; but as soon as weapproached its vicinity, the females gradually separatedthemselves from the crowd, and standing aloof, permitted us topass on.&nbsp;&nbsp;The merciless prohibitions of the taboo extendedlikewise to this edifice, and were enforced by the same dreadfulpenalty that secured the Hoolah-Hoolah ground from the imaginarypollution of a woman's presence.</p><p> On entering the house, I was surprised to see six muskets rangedagainst the bamboo on one side, from the barrels of whichdepended as many small canvas pouches, partly filled with powder.</p><p> Disposed about these muskets, like the cutlasses that decoratethe bulkhead of a man-of-war's cabin, were a great variety ofrude spears and paddles, javelins, and war-clubs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This then,said I to Toby, must be the armoury of the tribe.</p><p> As we advanced further along the building, we were struck withthe aspect of four or five hideous old wretches, on whosedecrepit forms time and tattooing seemed,to have obliteratedevery trace of humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the continued operation ofthis latter process, which only terminates among the warriors ofthe island after all the figures stretched upon their limbs inyouth have been blended together--an effect, however, producedonly in cases of extreme longevity--the bodies Of these men wereof a uniform dull green colour--the hue which the tattooinggradually assumes as the individual advances in age.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their skinhad a frightful scaly appearance, which, united with its singularcolour, made their limbs not a little resemble dusty specimens ofverde-antique.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their flesh, in parts, hung upon them in hugefolds, like the overlapping plaits on the flank of a rhinoceros.Their heads were completely bald, whilst their faces werepuckered into a thousand wrinkles, and they presented no vestigeof a beard.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most remarkable peculiarity about them wasthe appearance of their feet; the toes, like the radiating linesof the mariner's compass, pointed to every quarter of thehorizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was doubtless attributable to the fact, thatduring nearly a hundred years of existence the said toes neverhad been subjected to any artificial confinement, and in theirold age, being averse to close neighbourhood, bid one anotherkeep open order.</p><p> These repulsive-looking creatures appeared to have lost the useof their lower limbs altogether; sitting upon the floorcross-legged in a state of torpor.&nbsp;&nbsp;They never heeded us in theleast, scarcely looking conscious of our presence, while Meheviseated us upon the mats, and Kory-Kory gave utterance to someunintelligible gibberish</p><p> In a few moments a boy entered with a wooden trencher ofpoee-poee; and in regaling myself with its contents I was obligedagain to submit to the officious intervention of my indefatigableservitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Various other dishes followed, the chief manifestingthe most hospitable importunity in pressing us to partake, and toremove all bashfulness on our part, set us no despicable examplein his own person.</p><p> The repast concluded, a pipe was lighted, which passed from mouthto mouth, and yielding to its soporific influence, the quiet ofthe place, and the deepening shadows of approaching night, mycompanion and I sank into a kind of drowsy repose, while thechief and Kory-Kory seemed to be slumbering beside us.</p><p> I awoke from an uneasy nap, about midnight, as I supposed; and,raising myself partly from the mat, became sensible that we wereenveloped in utter darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby lay still asleep, but our latecompanions had disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only sound that interrupted thesilence of the place was the asthmatic breathing of the old men Ihave mentioned, who reposed at a little distance from us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides them, as well as I could judge, there was no one else inthe house.</p><p> Apprehensive of some evil, I roused my comrade, and we wereengaged in a whispered conference concerning the unexpectedwithdrawal of the natives when all at once, from the depths ofthe grove, in full view of us where we lay, shoots of flame wereseen to rise, and in a few moments illuminated the surroundingtrees, casting, by contrast, into still deeper gloom the darknessaround us.</p><p> While we continued gazing at this sight, dark figures appearedmoving to and fro before the flames; while others, dancing andcapering about, looked like so many demons.</p><p> Regarding this new phenomenon with no small degree oftrepidation, I said to my companion, 'What can all this mean,Toby?'</p><p> 'Oh, nothing,' replied he; 'getting the fire ready, I suppose.'</p><p> 'Fire!' exclaimed I, while my heart took to beating like a triphammer, 'what fire?'</p><p> 'Why, the fire to cook us, to be sure, what else would thecannibals be kicking up such a row about if it were not forthat?'</p><p> 'Oh, Toby!&nbsp;&nbsp;have done with your jokes; this is no time for them;something is about to happen, I feel confident.'</p><p> 'Jokes, indeed?'&nbsp;&nbsp;exclaimed Toby indignantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Did you ever hearme joke?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, for what do you suppose the devils have beenfeeding us up in this kind of style during the last three days,unless it were for something that you are too much frightened atto talk about?&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at that Kory-Kory there!--has he not beenstuffing you with his confounded mushes, just in the way theytreat swine before they kill them?&nbsp;&nbsp;Depend upon it, we will beeaten this blessed night, and there is the fire we shall beroasted by.'</p><p> This view of the matter was not at all calculated to allay myapprehensions, and I shuddered when I reflected that we wereindeed at the mercy of a tribe of cannibals, and that thedreadful contingency to which Toby had alluded was by no meansremoved beyond the bounds of possibility.</p><p> 'There!&nbsp;&nbsp;I told you so!&nbsp;&nbsp;they are coming for us!' exclaimed mycompanion the next moment, as the forms of four of the islanderswere seen in bold relief against the illuminated back-groundmounting the pi-pi and approaching towards us.</p><p> They came on noiselessly, nay stealthily, and glided alongthrough the gloom that surrounded us as if about to spring uponsome object they were fearful of disturbing before they shouldmake sure of it.--Gracious heaven!&nbsp;&nbsp;the horrible reflectionswhich crowded upon me that moment.--A cold sweat stood upon mybrow, and spell-bound with terror I awaited my fate!</p><p> Suddenly the silence was broken by the well-remembered tones ofMehevi, and at the kindly accents of his voice my fears wereimmediately dissipated.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tommo, Toby, ki ki!' (eat).&nbsp;&nbsp;He hadwaited to address us, until he had assured himself that we wereboth awake, at which he seemed somewhat surprised.</p><p> 'Ki ki!&nbsp;&nbsp;is it?'&nbsp;&nbsp;said Toby in his gruff tones; 'Well, cook usfirst, will you--but what's this?'&nbsp;&nbsp;he added, as another savageappeared, bearing before him a large trencher of wood containingsome kind of steaming meat, as appeared from the odours itdiffused, and which he deposited at the feet of Mehevi.&nbsp;&nbsp;'A bakedbaby, I dare say I but I will have none of it, never mind what itis.--A pretty fool I should make of myself, indeed, waked up herein the middle of the night, stuffing and guzzling, and all tomake a fat meal for a parcel of booby-minded cannibals one ofthese mornings!--No, I see what they are at very plainly, so I amresolved to starve myself into a bunch of bones and gristle, andthen, if they serve me up, they are welcome!&nbsp;&nbsp;But I say, Tommo,you are not going to eat any of that mess there, in the dark, areyou?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, how can you tell what it is?'</p><p> 'By tasting it, to be sure,' said I, masticating a morsel thatKory-Kory had just put in my mouth, 'and excellently good it is,too, very much like veal.'</p><p> 'A baked baby, by the soul of Captain Cook!' burst forth Toby,with amazing vehemence; 'Veal?&nbsp;&nbsp;why there never was a calf on theisland till you landed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you you are bolting downmouthfuls from a dead Happar's carcass, as sure as you live, andno mistake!'</p><p> Emetics and lukewarm water!&nbsp;&nbsp;What a sensation in the abdominalregion!&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, where could the fiends incarnate haveobtained meat?&nbsp;&nbsp;But I resolved to satisfy myself at all hazards;and turning to Mehevi, I soon made the ready chief understandthat I wished a light to be brought.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the taper came, Igazed eagerly into the vessel, and recognized the mutilatedremains of a juvenile porker!&nbsp;&nbsp;'Puarkee!' exclaimed Kory-Kory,looking complacently at the dish; and from that day to this Ihave never forgotten that such is the designation of a pig in theTypee lingo.</p><p> The next morning, after being again abundantly feasted by thehospitable Mehevi, Toby and myself arose to depart.&nbsp;&nbsp;But thechief requested us to postpone our intention.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Abo, abo' (Wait,wait), he said and accordingly we resumed our seats, while,assisted by the zealous Kory-Kory, he appeared to be engaged ingiving directions to a number of the natives outside, who werebusily employed in making arrangements, the nature of which wecould not comprehend.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we were not left long in ourignorance, for a few moments only had elapsed, when the chiefbeckoned us to approach, and we perceived that he had beenmarshalling a kind of guard of honour to escort us on our returnto the house of Marheyo.</p><p> The procession was led off by two venerable-looking savages, eachprovided with a spear, from the end of which streamed a pennon ofmilk-white tappa.&nbsp;&nbsp;After them went several youths, bearing aloftcalabashes of poee-poee, and followed in their turn by fourstalwart fellows, sustaining long bamboos, from the tops of whichhung suspended, at least twenty feet from the ground, largebaskets of green bread-fruits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came a troop of boys,carrying bunches of ripe bananas, and baskets made of the wovenleaflets of cocoanut boughs, filled with the young fruit of thetree, the naked shells stripped of their husks peeping forth fromthe verdant wicker-work that surrounded them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last of all came aburly islander, holding over his head a wooden trencher, in whichlay disposed the remnants of our midnight feast, hidden fromview, however, by a covering of bread-fruit leaves.</p><p> Astonished as I was at this exhibition, I could not avoid smilingat its grotesque appearance, and the associations it naturallycalled up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mehevi, it seemed, was bent on replenishing oldMarheyo's larder, fearful perhaps that without this precautionhis guests might not fare as well as they could desire.</p><p> As soon as I descended from the pi-pi, the procession formedanew, enclosing us in its centre; where I remained part of thetime, carried by Kory-Kory, and occasionally relieving him fromhis burden by limping along with spear.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we moved off inthis order, the natives struck up a musical recitative, whichwith various alternations, they continued until we arrived at theplace of our destination.</p><p> As we proceeded on our way, bands of young girls, darting fromthe surrounding groves, hung upon our skirts, and accompanied uswith shouts of merriment and delight, which almost drowned thedeep notes of the recitative.&nbsp;&nbsp;On approaching old Marheyo'sdomicile, its inmates rushed out to receive us; and while thegifts of Mehevi were being disposed of, the superannuated warriordid the honours of his mansion with all the warmth of hospitalityevinced by an English squire when he regales his friends at somefine old patrimonial mansion.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Thirteen</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p> ATTEMPT TO PROCURE RELIEF FROM NUKUHEVA--PERILOUS ADVENTURE OFTOBY IN THE HAPPAR MOUNTAINS--ELOQUENCE OF KORY-KORY</p><p> AMIDST these novel scenes a week passed away almostimperceptibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives, actuated by some mysterious impulse,day after day redoubled their attentions to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mannertowards us was unaccountable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, thought I, they would notact thus if they meant us any harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;But why this excess ofdeferential kindness, or what equivalent can they imagine uscapable of rendering them for it?</p><p> We were fairly puzzled.&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite the apprehensions I couldnot dispel, the horrible character imputed to these Typeesappeared to be wholly undeserved.</p><p> 'Why, they are cannibals!' said Toby on one occasion when Ieulogized the tribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Granted,' I replied, 'but a more humane,gentlemanly and amiable set of epicures do not probably exist inthe Pacific.'</p><p> But, notwithstanding the kind treatment we received, I was toofamiliar with the fickle disposition of savages not to feelanxious to withdraw from the valley, and put myself beyond thereach of that fearful death which, under all these smilingappearances, might yet menace us.&nbsp;&nbsp;But here there was an obstaclein the way of doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was idle for me to think of movingfrom the place until I should have recovered from the severelameness that afflicted me; indeed my malady began seriously toalarm me; for, despite the herbal remedies of the natives, itcontinued to grow worse and worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mild applications,though they soothed the pain, did not remove the disorder, and Ifelt convinced that without better aid I might anticipate longand acute suffering.</p><p> But how was this aid to be procured?&nbsp;&nbsp;From the surgeons of theFrench fleet, which probably still lay in the bay of Nukuheva, itmight easily have been obtained, could I have made my case knownto them.&nbsp;&nbsp;But how could that be effected?</p><p> At last, in the exigency to which I was reduced, I proposed toToby that he should endeavour to go round to Nukuheva, and if hecould not succeed in returning to the valley by water, in one ofthe boats of the squadron, and taking me off, he might at leastprocure me some proper medicines, and effect his return overland.</p><p> My companion listened to me in silence, and at first did notappear to relish the idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth was, he felt impatient toescape from the place, and wished to avail himself of our presenthigh favour with the natives to make good our retreat, before weshould experience some sudden alteration in their behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashe could not think of leaving me in my helpless condition, heimplored me to be of good cheer; assured me that I should soon bebetter, and enabled in a few days to return with him to Nukuheva.</p><p> Added to this, he could not bear the idea of again returning tothis dangerous place; and as for the expectation of persuadingthe Frenchmen to detach a boat's crew for the purpose of rescuingme from the Typees, he looked upon it as idle; and with argumentsthat I could not answer, urged the improbability of theirprovoking the hostilities of the clan by any such measure;especially, as for the purpose of quieting its apprehensions,they had as yet refrained from making any visit to the bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Andeven should they consent,' said Toby, 'they would only produce acommotion in the valley, in which we might both be sacrificed bythese ferocious islanders.'&nbsp;&nbsp;This was unanswerable; but still Iclung to the belief that he might succeed in accomplishing theother part of my plan; and at last I overcame his scruples, andhe agreed to make the attempt.</p><p> As soon as we succeeded in making the natives understand ourintention, they broke out into the most vehement opposition tothe measure, and for a while I almost despaired of obtainingtheir consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bare thought of one of us leaving them,they manifested the most lively concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;The grief andconsternation of Kory-Kory, in particular, was unbounded; hethrew himself into a perfect paroxysm of gestures which wereintended to convey to us not only his abhorrence of Nukuheva andits uncivilized inhabitants, but also his astonishment that afterbecoming acquainted with the enlightened Typees, we should evincethe least desire to withdraw, even for a time, from theiragreeable society.</p><p> However, I overbore his objections by appealing to my lameness;from which I assured the natives I should speedily recover ifToby were permitted to obtain the supplies I needed.</p><p> It was agreed that on the following morning my companion shoulddepart, accompanied by some one or two of the household, whoshould point out to him an easy route, by which the bay might bereached before sunset.</p><p> At early dawn of the next day, our habitation was astir.&nbsp;&nbsp;One ofthe young men mounted into an adjoining cocoanut tree, and threwdown a number of the young fruit, which old Marheyo quicklystripped of the green husks, and strung together upon a shortpole.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were intended to refresh Toby on his route.</p><p> The preparations being completed, with no little emotion I bademy companion adieu.&nbsp;&nbsp;He promised to return in three days atfarthest; and, bidding me keep up my spirits in the interval,turned round the corner of the pi-pi, and, under the guidance ofthe venerable Marheyo, was soon out of sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;His departureoppressed me with melancholy, and, re-entering the dwelling, Ithrew myself almost in despair upon the matting of the floor.</p><p> In two hours' time the old warrior returned, and gave me tounderstand that after accompanying my companion a littledistance, and showing him the route, he had left him journeyingon his way.</p><p> It was about noon of this same day, a season which these peopleare wont to pass in sleep, that I lay in the house, surrounded byits slumbering inmates, and painfully affected by the strangesilence which prevailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;All at once I thought I heard a faintshout, as if proceeding from some persons in the depth of thegrove which extended in front of our habitation.</p><p> The sounds grew louder and nearer, and gradually the whole valleyrang with wild outcries.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleepers around me started to theirfeet in alarm, and hurried outside to discover the cause of thecommotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kory-Kory, who had been the first to spring up, soonreturned almost breathless, and nearly frantic with theexcitement under which he seemed to be labouring.&nbsp;&nbsp;All that Icould understand from him was that some accident had happened toToby.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprehensive of some dreadful calamity, I rushed out ofthe house, and caught sight of a tumultuous crowd, who, withshrieks and lamentations, were just emerging from the grovebearing in their arms some object, the sight of which producedall this transport of sorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;As they drew near, the menredoubled their cries, while the girls, tossing their bare armsin the air, exclaimed plaintively, 'Awha!&nbsp;&nbsp;awha!&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby mukeemoee!'--Alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby is killed!</p><p> In a moment the crowd opened, and disclosed the apparentlylifeless body of my companion home between two men, the headhanging heavily against the breast of the foremost.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wholeface, neck, back, and bosom were covered with blood, which stilltrickled slowly from a wound behind the temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst ofthe greatest uproar and confusion the body was carried into thehouse and laid on a mat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Waving the natives off to give room andair, I bent eagerly over Toby, and, laying my hand upon thebreast, ascertained that the heart still beat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overjoyed atthis, I seized a calabash of water, and dashed its contents uponhis face, then wiping away the blood, anxiously examined thewound.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about three inches long, and on removing theclotted hair from about it, showed the skull laid completelybare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately with my knife I cut away the heavy locks, andbathed the part repeatedly in water.</p><p> In a few moments Toby revived, and opening his eyes for asecond--closed them again without speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kory-Kory, who hadbeen kneeling beside me, now chafed his limbs gently with thepalms of his hands, while a young girl at his head kept fanninghim, and I still continued to moisten his lips and brow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon mypoor comrade showed signs of animation, and I succeeded in makinghim swallow from a cocoanut shell a few mouthfuls of water.</p><p> Old Tinor now appeared, holding in her hand some simples she hadgathered, the juice of which she by signs besought me to squeezeinto the wound.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having done so, I thought it best to leave Tobyundisturbed until he should have had time to rally his faculties.Several times he opened his lips, but fearful for his safety Ienjoined silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of two or three hours, however,he sat up, and was sufficiently recovered to tell me what hadoccurred.</p><p> 'After leaving the house with Marheyo,' said Toby, 'we struckacross the valley, and ascended the opposite heights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Justbeyond them, my guide informed me, lay the valley of Happar,while along their summits, and skirting the head of the vale, wasmy route to Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;After mounting a little way up theelevation my guide paused, and gave me to understand that hecould not accompany me any farther, and by various signsintimated that he was afraid to approach any nearer theterritories of the enemies of his tribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;He however pointed outmy path, which now lay clearly before me, and bidding mefarewell, hastily descended the mountain.</p><p> 'Quite elated at being so near the Happars, I pushed up theacclivity, and soon gained its summit.&nbsp;&nbsp;It tapered to a sharpridge, from whence I beheld both the hostile valleys.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I satdown and rested for a moment, refreshing myself with mycocoanuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was soon again pursuing my way along the height,when suddenly I saw three of the islanders, who must have justcome out of Happar valley, standing in the path ahead of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were each armed with a heavy spear, and one from hisappearance I took to be a chief.&nbsp;&nbsp;They sung out something, Icould not understand what, and beckoned me to come on.</p><p> 'Without the least hesitation I advanced towards them, and hadapproached within about a yard of the foremost, when, pointingangrily into the Typee valley, and uttering some savageexclamation, he wheeled round his weapon like lightning, andstruck me in a moment to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;The blow inflicted thiswound, and took away my senses.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I came to myself, Iperceived the three islanders standing a little distance off, andapparently engaged in some violent altercation respecting me.</p><p> 'My first impulse was to run for it; but, in endeavouring torise, I fell back, and rolled down a little grassy precipice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock seemed to rally my faculties; so, starting to my feet,I fled down the path I had just ascended.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no need to lookbehind me, for, from the yells I heard, I knew that my enemieswere in full pursuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged on by their fearful outcries, andheedless of the injury I had received--though the blood flowingfrom the wound trickled over into my eyes and almost blindedme--I rushed down the mountain side with the speed of the wind.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short time I had descended nearly a third of the distance,and the savages had ceased their cries, when suddenly a terrifichowl burst upon my ear, and at the same moment a heavy javelindarted past me as I fled, and stuck quivering in a tree close tome.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another yell followed, and a second spear and a third shotthrough the air within a few feet of my body, both of thempiercing the ground obliquely in advance of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fellows gavea roar of rage and disappointment; but they were afraid, Isuppose, of coming down further into the Typee valley, and soabandoned the chase.&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw them recover their weapons and turnback; and I continued my descent as fast as I could.</p><p> 'What could have caused this ferocious attack on the part ofthese Happars I could not imagine, unless it were that they hadseen me ascending the mountain with Marheyo, and that the merefact of coming from the Typee valley was sufficient to provokethem.</p><p> 'As long as I was in danger I scarcely felt the wound I hadreceived; but when the chase was over I began to suffer from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had lost my hat in the flight, and the run scorched my barehead.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt faint and giddy; but, fearful of falling to theground beyond the reach of assistance, I staggered on as well asI could, and at last gained the level of the valley, and thendown I sank; and I knew nothing more until I found myself lyingupon these mats, and you stooping over me with the calabash ofwater.'</p><p> Such was Toby's account of this sad affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;I afterwards learnedthat, fortunately, he had fallen close to a spot where thenatives go for fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;A party of them caught sight of him as hefell, and sounding the alarm, had lifted him up; and afterineffectually endeavouring to restore him at the brook, hadhurried forward with him to the house.</p><p> This incident threw a dark cloud over our prospects.&nbsp;&nbsp;It remindedus that we were hemmed in by hostile tribes, whose territories wecould not hope to pass, on our route to Nukuheva, withoutencountering the effects of their savage resentment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereappeared to be no avenue opened to our escape but the sea, whichwashed the lower extremities of the vale.</p><p> Our Typee friends availed themselves of the recent disaster ofToby to exhort us to a due appreciation of the blessings weenjoyed among them, contrasting their own generous reception ofus with the animosity of their neighbours.&nbsp;&nbsp;They likewise dweltupon the cannibal propensities of the Happars, a subject whichthey were perfectly aware could not fail to alarm us; while atthe same time they earnestly disclaimed all participation in sohorrid a custom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did they omit to call upon us to admire thenatural loveliness of their own abode, and the lavish abundancewith which it produced all manner of luxuriant fruits; exaltingit in this particular above any of the surrounding valleys.</p><p> Kory-Kory seemed to experience so heartfelt a desire to infuseinto our minds proper views on these subjects, that, assisted inhis endeavours by the little knowledge of the language we hadacquired, he actually made us comprehend a considerable part ofwhat he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate our correct apprehension of hismeaning, he at first condensed his ideas into the smallestpossible compass.</p><p> 'Happar keekeeno nuee,' he exclaimed, 'nuee, nuee, ki kikannaka!--ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;owle motarkee!' which signifies, 'Terrible fellowsthose Happars!--devour an amazing quantity of men!--ah, shockingbad!'&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far he explained himself by a variety of gestures,during the performance of which he would dart out of the house,and point abhorrently towards the Happar valley; running in to usagain with a rapidity that showed he was fearful he would loseone part of his meaning before he could complete the other; andcontinuing his illustrations by seizing the fleshy part of my armin his teeth, intimating by the operation that the people wholived over in that direction would like nothing better than totreat me in that manner.</p><p> Having assured himself that we were fully enlightened on thispoint, he proceeded to another branch of his subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ah! Typee mortakee!--nuee, nuee mioree--nuee, nuee wai--nuee, nueepoee-poee--nuee, nuee kokoo--ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;nuee, nuee kiki--ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;nuee,nuee, nuee!' Which literally interpreted as before, would imply,'Ah, Typee!&nbsp;&nbsp;isn't it a fine place though!--no danger of starvinghere, I tell you!--plenty of bread-fruit--plenty of water--plentyof pudding--ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;plenty of everything!&nbsp;&nbsp;ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;heaps, heaps heaps!' All this was accompanied by a running commentary of signs andgestures which it was impossible not to comprehend.</p><p> As he continued his harangue, however, Kory-Kory, in emulation ofour more polished orators, began to launch out rather diffuselyinto other branches of his subject, enlarging probably upon themoral reflections it suggested; and proceeded in such a strain ofunintelligible and stunning gibberish, that he actually gave methe headache for the rest of the day.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Fourteen</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p> A GREAT EVENT HAPPENS IN THE VALLEY--THE ISLANDTELEGRAPH--SOMETHING BEFALLS TOBY--FAYAWAY DISPLAYS A TENDERHEART--MELANCHOLY REFLECTIONS--MYSTERIOUS CONDUCT OF THEISLANDERS--DEVOTION OF KORY-KORY--A RURAL COUCH--ALUXURY--KORY-KORY STRIKES A LIGHT A LA TYPEE</p><p> IN the course of a few days Toby had recovered from the effectsof his adventure with the Happar warriors; the wound on his headrapidly healing under the vegetable treatment of the good Tinor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Less fortunate than my companion however, I still continued tolanguish under a complaint, the origin and nature of which werestill a mystery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut off as I was from all intercourse with thecivilized world, and feeling the inefficacy of anything thenatives could do to relieve me; knowing, too, that so long as Iremained in my present condition, it would be impossible for meto leave the valley, whatever opportunity might present itself;and apprehensive that ere long we might be exposed to somecaprice on the part of the islanders, I now gave up all hopes ofrecovery, and became a prey to the most gloomy thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;A deepdejection fell upon me, which neither the friendly remonstrancesof my companion, the devoted attentions of Kory-Kory nor all thesoothing influences of Fayaway could remove.</p><p> One morning as I lay on the mats in the house, plunged inmelancholy reverie, and regardless of everything around me, Toby,who had left me about an hour, returned in haste, and with greatglee told me to cheer up and be of good heart; for he believed,from what was going on among the natives, that there were boatsapproaching the bay.</p><p> These tidings operated upon me like magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour of ourdeliverance was at hand, and starting up, I was soon convincedthat something unusual was about to occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;The word 'botee!botee!' was vociferated in all directions; and shouts were heardin the distance, at first feebly and faintly; but growing louderand nearer at each successive repetition, until they were caughtup by a fellow in a cocoanut tree a few yards off, who soundingthem in turn, they were reiterated from a neighbouring grove, andso died away gradually from point to point, as the intelligencepenetrated into the farthest recess of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was thevocal telegraph of the islanders; by means of which condenseditems of information could be carried in a very few minutes fromthe sea to their remotest habitation, a distance of at leasteight or nine miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the present occasion it was in activeoperation; one piece of information following another withinconceivable rapidity.</p><p> The greatest commotion now appeared to prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp;At every freshitem of intelligence the natives betrayed the liveliest interest,and redoubled the energy with which they employed themselves incollecting fruit to sell to the expected visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some weretearing off the husks from cocoanuts; some perched in the treeswere throwing down bread-fruit to their companions, who gatheredthem into heaps as they fell; while others were plying theirfingers rapidly in weaving leafen baskets in which to carry thefruit.</p><p> There were other matters too going on at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here youwould see a stout warrior polishing his spear with a bit of oldtappa, or adjusting the folds of the girdle about his waist; andthere you might descry a young damsel decorating herself withflowers, as if having in her eye some maidenly conquest; while,as in all cases of hurry and confusion in every part of theworld, a number of individuals kept hurrying to and fro, withamazing vigour and perseverance, doing nothing themselves, andhindering others.</p><p> Never before had we seen the islanders in such a state of bustleand excitement; and the scene furnished abundant evidence of thefact--that it was only at long intervals any such events occur.</p><p> When I thought of the length of time that might intervene beforea similar chance of escape would be presented, I bitterlylamented that I had not the power of availing myself effectuallyof the present opportunity.</p><p> From all that we could gather, it appeared that the natives werefearful of arriving too late upon the beach, unless they madeextraordinary exertions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick and lame as I was, I would havestarted with Toby at once, had not Kory-Kory not only refused tocarry me, but manifested the most invincible repugnance to ourleaving the neighbourhood of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the savageswere equally opposed to our wishes, and seemed grieved andastonished at the earnestness of my solicitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;I clearlyperceived that while my attendant avoided all appearance ofconstraining my movements, he was nevertheless determined tothwart my wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed to me on this particular occasion,as well as often afterwards, to be executing the orders of someother person with regard to me, though at the same time feelingtowards me the most lively affection.</p><p> Toby, who had made up his mind to accompany the islanders ifpossible, as soon as they were in readiness to depart, and whofor that reason had refrained from showing the same anxiety thatI had done, now represented to me that it was idle for me toentertain the hope of reaching the beach in time to profit by anyopportunity that might then be presented.</p><p> 'Do you not see,' said he, 'the savages themselves are fearful ofbeing too late, and I should hurry forward myself at once did Inot think that if I showed too much eagerness I should destroyall our hopes of reaping any benefit from this fortunate event.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will only endeavour to appear tranquil or unconcerned, youwill quiet their suspicions, and I have no doubt they will thenlet me go with them to the beach, supposing that I merely go outof curiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I succeed in getting down to the boats, Iwill make known the condition in which I have left you, andmeasures may then be taken to secure our escape.'</p><p> In the expediency of this I could not but acquiesce; and as thenatives had now completed their preparations, I watched with theliveliest interest the reception that Toby's application mightmeet with.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they understood from my companion that Iintended to remain, they appeared to make no objection to hisproposition, and even hailed it with pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their singularconduct on this occasion not a little puzzled me at the time, andimparted to subsequent events an additional mystery.</p><p> The islanders were now to be seen hurrying along the path whichled to the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook Toby warmly by the hand, and gave him myPayta hat to shield his wounded head from the sun, as he had losthis own.&nbsp;&nbsp;He cordially returned the pressure of my hand, andsolemnly promising to return as soon as the boats should leavethe shore, sprang from my side, and the next minute disappearedin a turn of the grove.</p><p> In spite of the unpleasant reflections that crowded upon my mind,I could not but be entertained by the novel and animated sightwhich by now met my view.&nbsp;&nbsp;One after another the natives crowdedalong the narrow path, laden with every variety of fruit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here,you might have seen one, who, after ineffectually endeavouring topersuade a surly porker to be conducted in leading strings, wasobliged at last to seize the perverse animal in his arms, andcarry him struggling against his naked breast, and squealingwithout intermission.&nbsp;&nbsp;There went two, who at a little distancemight have been taken for the Hebrew spies, on their return toMoses with the goodly bunch of grape.&nbsp;&nbsp;One trotted before theother at a distance of a couple of yards, while between them,from a pole resting on the shoulders, was suspended a hugecluster of bananas, which swayed to and fro with the rocking gaitat which they proceeded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here ran another, perspiring with hisexertions, and bearing before him a quantity of cocoanuts, who,fearful of being too late, heeded not the fruit that dropped fromhis basket, and appeared solely intent upon reaching hisdestination, careless how many of his cocoanuts kept company withhim.</p><p> In a short time the last straggler was seen hurrying on his way,and the faint shouts of those in advance died insensibly upon theear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our part of the valley now appeared nearly deserted by itsinhabitants, Kory-Kory, his aged father, and a few decrepit oldpeople, being all that were left.</p><p> Towards sunset the islanders in small parties began to returnfrom the beach, and among them, as they drew near to the house, Isought to descry the form of my companion.&nbsp;&nbsp;But one after anotherthey passed the dwelling, and I caught no glimpse of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing, however, that he would soon appear with some of themembers of the household, I quieted my apprehensions, and waitedpatiently to see him advancing in company with the beautifulFayaway.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, I perceived Tinor coming forward, followed bythe girls and young men who usually resided in the house ofMarheyo; but with them came not my comrade, and, filled with athousand alarms, I eagerly sought to discover the cause of hisdelay.</p><p> My earnest questions appeared to embarrass the natives greatly.&nbsp;&nbsp;All their accounts were contradictory: one giving me tounderstand that Toby would be with me in a very short time;another that he did not know where he was; while a third,violently inveighing, against him, assured me that he had stolenaway, and would never come back.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appeared to me, at the time,that in making these various statements they endeavoured toconceal from me some terrible disaster, lest the knowledge of itshould overpower me.</p><p> Fearful lest some fatal calamity had overtaken him, I sought outyoung Fayaway, and endeavoured to learn from her, if possible,the truth.</p><p> This gentle being had early attracted my regard, not only fromher extraordinary beauty, but from the attractive cast of hercountenance, singularly expressive of intelligence and humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the natives she alone seemed to appreciate the effectwhich the peculiarity of the circumstances in which we wereplaced had produced upon the minds of my companion and myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing me--especially when I lay reclining upon the matssuffering from pain--there was a tenderness in her manner whichit was impossible to misunderstand or resist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever sheentered the house, the expression of her face indicated theliveliest sympathy for me; and moving towards the place where Ilay, with one arm slightly elevated in a gesture of pity, and herlarge glistening eyes gazing intently into mine, she would murmurplaintively, 'Awha!&nbsp;&nbsp;awha!&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommo,' and seat herself mournfullybeside me.</p><p> Her manner convinced me that she deeply compassionated mysituation, as being removed from my country and friends, andplaced beyond the reach of all relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, at times I wasalmost led to believe that her mind was swayed by gentle impulseshardly to be anticipated from one in her condition; that sheappeared to be conscious there were ties rudely severed, whichhad once bound us to our homes; that there were sisters andbrothers anxiously looking forward to our return, who were,perhaps, never more to behold us.</p><p> In this amiable light did Fayaway appear m my eyes; and reposingfull confidence in her candour and intelligence, I now hadrecourse to her, in the midst of my alarm, with regard to mycompanion.</p><p> My questions evidently distressed her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked round from oneto another of the bystanders, as if hardly knowing what answer togive me.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, yielding to my importunities, she overcame herscruples, and gave me to understand that Toby had gone away withthe boats which had visited the bay, but had promised to returnat the expiration of three days.&nbsp;&nbsp;At first I accused him ofperfidiously deserting me; but as I grew more composed, Iupbraided myself for imputing so cowardly an action to him, andtranquillized myself with the belief that he had availed himself,of the opportunity to go round to Nukuheva, in order to make somearrangement by which I could be removed from the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;At anyrate, thought I, he will return with the medicines I require, andthen, as soon as I recover, there will be no difficulty in theway of our departure.</p><p> Consoling myself with these reflections, I lay down that night ina happier frame of mind than I had done for some time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The nextday passed without any allusion to Toby on the part of thenatives, who seemed desirous of avoiding all reference to thesubject.&nbsp;&nbsp;This raised some apprehensions in my breast; but whennight came, I congratulated myself that the second day had nowgone by, and that on the morrow Toby would again be with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Butthe morrow came and went, and my companion did not appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah!thought I, he reckons three days from the morning of hisdeparture,--tomorrow he will arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that weary day alsoclosed upon me, without his return.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even yet I would notdespair; I thought that something detained him--that he waswaiting for the sailing of a boat, at Nukuheva, and that in a dayor two at farthest I should see him again.&nbsp;&nbsp;But day after day ofrenewed disappointment passed by; at last hope deserted me, and Ifell a victim to despair.</p><p> Yes; thought I, gloomily, he has secured his own escape, andcares not what calamity may befall his unfortunate comrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;Foolthat I was, to suppose that any one would willingly encounter theperils of this valley, after having once got beyond its limits!&nbsp;&nbsp;He has gone, and has left me to combat alone all the dangers bywhich I am surrounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus would I sometimes seek to derive adesperate consolation from dwelling upon the perfidity of Toby:whilst at other times I sunk under the bitter remorse which Ifelt as having by my own imprudence brought upon myself the fatewhich I was sure awaited me.</p><p> At other times I thought that perhaps after all these treacheroussavages had made away with him, and thence the confusion intowhich they were thrown by my questions, and their contradictoryanswers, or he might be a captive in some other part of thevalley, or, more dreadful still, might have met with that fate atwhich my very soul shuddered.&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these speculations werevain; no tidings of Toby ever reached me; he had gone never toreturn.</p><p> The conduct of the islanders appeared inexplicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allreference to my lost comrade was carefully evaded, and if at anytime they were forced to make some reply to my frequent inquirieson the subject, they would uniformly denounce him as anungrateful runaway, who had deserted his friend, and takenhimself off to that vile and detestable place Nukuheva.</p><p> But whatever might have been his fate, now that he was gone thenatives multiplied their acts of kindness and attention towardsmyself, treating me with a degree of deference which could hardlyhave been surpassed had I been some celestial visitant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kory-Kory never for one moment left my side, unless it were toexecute my wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The faithful fellow, twice every day, in thecool of the morning and in the evening, insisted upon carrying meto the stream, and bathing me in its refreshing water.</p><p> Frequently in the afternoon he would carry me to a particularpart of the stream, where the beauty of the scene produced asoothing influence upon my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this place the waters flowedbetween grassy banks, planted with enormous bread-fruit trees,whose vast branches interlacing overhead, formed a leafy canopy;near the stream were several smooth black rocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these,projecting several feet above the surface of the,water, had uponits summit a shallow cavity, which, filled with freshly-gatheredleaves, formed a delightful couch.</p><p> Here I often lay for hours, covered with a gauze-like veil oftappa, while Fayaway, seated beside me, and holding in her hand afan woven from the leaflets of a young cocoanut bough, brushedaside the insects that occasionally lighted on my face, andKory-Kory.&nbsp;&nbsp;with a view of chasing away my melancholy, performeda thousand antics in the water before us.</p><p> As my eye wandered along this romantic stream, it would fall uponthe half-immersed figure of a beautiful girl, standing in thetransparent water, and catching in a little net a species ofdiminutive shell-fish, of which these people are extraordinarilyfond.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a chattering group would be seated upon the edgeof a low rock in the midst of the brook, busily engaged inthinning and polishing the shells of cocoanuts, by rubbing thembriskly with a small stone in the water, an operation which soonconverts them into a light and elegant drinking vessel, somewhatresembling goblets made of tortoise shell.</p><p> But the tranquillizing influence of beautiful scenery, and theexhibition of human life under so novel and charming an aspectwere not my only sources of consolation.</p><p> Every evening the girls of the house gathered about me on themats, and after chasing away Kory-Kory from my side--whonevertheless, retired only to a little distance and watched theirproceedings with the most jealous attention--would anoint mywhole body with a fragrant oil, squeezed from a yellow root,previously pounded between a couple of stones, and which in theirlanguage is denominated 'aka'.&nbsp;&nbsp;And most refreshing and agreeableare the juices of the 'aka', when applied to ones, limbs by thesoft palms of sweet nymphs, whose bright eyes are beaming uponyou with kindness; and I used to hail with delight the dailyrecurrence of this luxurious operation, in which I forgot all mytroubles, and buried for the time every feeling of sorrow.</p><p> Sometimes in the cool of the evening my devoted servitor wouldlead me out upon the pi-pi in front of the house, and seating menear its edge, protect my body from the annoyance of the insectswhich occasionally hovered in the air, by wrapping me round witha large roll of tappa.&nbsp;&nbsp;He then bustled about, and employedhimself at least twenty minutes in adjusting everything to securemy personal comfort.</p><p> Having perfected his arrangements, he would get my pipe, and,lighting it, would hand it to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often he was obliged to strikea light for the occasion, and as the mode he adopted was entirelydifferent from what I had ever seen or heard of before I willdescribe it.</p><p> A straight, dry, and partly decayed stick of the Hibiscus, aboutsix feet in length, and half as many inches in diameter, with asmall, bit of wood not more than a foot long, and scarcely aninch wide, is as invariably to be met with in every house inTypee as a box of lucifer matches in the corner of a kitchencupboard at home.</p><p> The islander, placing the larger stick obliquely against someobject, with one end elevated at an angle of forty-five degrees,mounts astride of it like an urchin about to gallop off upon acane, and then grasping the smaller one firmly in both hands, herubs its pointed end slowly up and down the extent of a fewinches on the principal suck, until at last he makes a narrowgroove in the wood, with an abrupt termination at the pointfurthest from him, where all the dusty particles which thefriction creates are accumulated in a little heap.</p><p> At first Kory-Kory goes to work quite leisurely, but graduallyquickens his pace, and waxing warm in the employment, drives thestick furiously along the smoking channel, plying his hands toand fro with amazing rapidity, the perspiration starting fromevery pore.&nbsp;&nbsp;As he approaches the climax of his effort, he pantsand gasps for breath, and his eyes almost start from theirsockets with the violence of his exertions.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the criticalstage of the operation; all his previous labours are vain if hecannot sustain the rapidity of the movement until the reluctantspark is produced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly he stops, becoming perfectlymotionless.&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands still retain their hold of the smallerstick, which is pressed convulsively against the further end ofthe channel among the fine powder there accumulated, as if he hadjust pierced through and through some little viper that waswriggling and struggling to escape from his clutches.&nbsp;&nbsp;The nextmoment a delicate wreath of smoke curls spirally into the air,the heap of dusty particles glows with fire, and Kory-Kory,almost breathless, dismounts from his steed.</p><p> This operation appeared to me to be the most laborious species ofwork performed in Typee; and had I possessed a sufficientintimacy with the language to have conveyed my ideas upon thesubject, I should certainly have suggested to the mostinfluential of the natives the expediency of establishing acollege of vestals to be centrally located in the valley, for thepurpose of keeping alive the indispensable article of fire; so asto supersede the necessity of such a vast outlay of strength andgood temper, as were usually squandered on these occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;There might, however, be special difficulties in carrying thisplan into execution.</p><p> What a striking evidence does this operation furnish of the widedifference between the extreme of savage and civilized life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Agentleman of Typee can bring up a numerous family of children andgive them all a highly respectable cannibal education, withinfinitely less toil and anxiety than he expends in the simpleprocess of striking a light; whilst a poor European artisan, whothrough the instrumentality of a lucifer performs the sameoperation in one second, is put to his wit's end to provide forhis starving offspring that food which the children of aPolynesian father, without troubling their parents, pluck fromthe branches of every tree around them.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Fifteen</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p> KINDNESS OF MARHEYO AND THE REST OF THE ISLANDERS--A FULLDESCRIPTION OF THE BREAD- FRUIT TREE--DIFFERENT MODES OFPREPARING THE FRUIT</p><p> ALL the inhabitants of the valley treated me with great kindness;but as to the household of Marheyo, with whom I was nowpermanently domiciled, nothing could surpass their efforts tominister to my comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the gratification of my palate theypaid the most unwearied attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;They continually invited meto partake of food, and when after eating heartily I declined theviands they continued to offer me, they seemed to think that myappetite stood in need of some piquant stimulant to excite itsactivity.</p><p> In pursuance of this idea, old Marheyo himself would hie him awayto the sea-shore by the break of day, for the purpose ofcollecting various species of rare sea-weed; some of which amongthese people are considered a great luxury.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a whole dayspent in this employment, he would return about nightfall withseveral cocoanut shells filled with different descriptions ofkelp.&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing these for use he manifested all theostentation of a professed cook, although the chief mystery ofthe affair appeared to consist in pouring water in judiciousquantities upon the slimy contents of his cocoanut shells.</p><p> The first time he submitted one of these saline salads to mycritical attention I naturally thought that anything collected atsuch pains must possess peculiar merits; but one mouthful was acomplete dose; and great was the consternation of the old warriorat the rapidity with which I ejected his Epicurean treat.</p><p> How true it is, that the rarity of any particular articleenhances its value amazingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some part of the valley--I knownot where, but probably in the neighbourhood of the sea--thegirls were sometimes in the habit of procuring small quantitiesof salt, a thimble-full or so being the result of the unitedlabours of a party of five or six employed for the greater partof the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;This precious commodity they brought to the house,enveloped in multitudinous folds of leaves; and as a special markof the esteem in which they held me, would spread an immense leafon the ground, and dropping one by one a few minute particles ofthe salt upon it, invite me to taste them.</p><p> From the extravagant value placed upon the article, I verilybelieve, that with a bushel of common Liverpool salt all the realestate in Typee might have been purchased.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a small pinch ofit in one hand, and a quarter section of a bread-fruit in theother, the greatest chief in the valley would have laughed at allluxuries of a Parisian table.</p><p> The celebrity of the bread-fruit tree, and the conspicuous placeit occupies in a Typee bill of fare, induces me to give at somelength a general description of the tree, and the various modesin which the fruit is prepared.</p><p> The bread-fruit tree, in its glorious prime, is a grand andtowering object, forming the same feature in a Marquesanlandscape that the patriarchal elm does in New England scenery.&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter tree it not a little resembles in height, in the widespread of its stalwart branches, and in its venerable andimposing aspect.</p><p> The leaves of the bread-fruit are of great size, and their edgesare cut and scolloped as fantastically as those of a lady's lacecollar.&nbsp;&nbsp;As they annually tend towards decay, they almost rivalin brilliant variety of their gradually changing hues thefleeting shades of the expiring dolphin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The autumnal tints ofour American forests, glorious as they are, sink into nothing incomparison with this tree.</p><p> The leaf, in one particular stage, when nearly all the prismaticcolours are blended on its surface, is often converted by thenatives into a superb and striking bead-dress.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principalfibre traversing its length being split open a convenientdistance, and the elastic sides of the aperture pressed apart,the head is inserted between them, the leaf drooping on one side,with its forward half turned jauntily up on the brows, and theremaining part spreading laterally behind the ears.</p><p> The fruit somewhat resembles in magnitude and general appearanceone of our citron melons of ordinary size; but, unlike thecitron, it has no sectional lines drawn along the outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;Itssurface is dotted all over with little conical prominences,looking not unlike the knobs, on an antiquated church door.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therind is perhaps an eighth of an inch in thickness; and denuded ofthis at the time when it is in the greatest perfection, the fruitpresents a beautiful globe of white pulp, the whole of which maybe eaten, with the exception of a slender core, which is easilyremoved.</p><p> The bread-fruit, however, is never used, and is indeed altogetherunfit to be eaten, until submitted in one form or other to theaction of fire.</p><p> The most simple manner in which this operation is performed, andI think, the best, consists in placing any number of the freshlyplucked fruit, when in a particular state of greenness, among theembers of a fire, in the same way that you would roast a potato.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lapse of ten or fifteen minutes, the green rindembrowns and.&nbsp;&nbsp;cracks, showing through the fissures in its sidesthe milk-white interior.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as it cools the rind drops off,and you then have the soft round pulp in its purest and mostdelicious state.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus eaten, it has a mild and pleasing flavour.</p><p> Sometimes after having been roasted in the fire, the nativessnatch it briskly from the embers, and permitting it to slip outof the yielding rind into a vessel of cold water, stir up themixture, which they call 'bo-a-sho'.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never could endure thiscompound, and indeed the preparation is not greatly in vogueamong the more polite Typees.</p><p> There is one form, however, in which the fruit is occasionallyserved, that renders it a dish fit for a king.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as it istaken from the fire the exterior is removed, the core extracted,and the remaining part is placed in a sort of shallow stonemortar, and briskly worked with a pestle of the same substance.&nbsp;&nbsp;While one person is performing this operation, another takes aripe cocoanut, and breaking it in halves, which they also do verycleverly, proceeds to grate the juicy meat into fine particles.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is done by means of a piece of mother-of-pearl shell, lashedfirmly to the extreme end of a heavy stick, with its straightside accurately notched like a saw.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stick is sometimes agrotesquely-formed limb of a tree, with three or four branchestwisting from its body like so many shapeless legs, andsustaining it two or three feet from the ground.</p><p> The native, first placing a calabash beneath the nose, as itwere, of his curious-looking log-steed, for the purpose ofreceiving the grated fragments as they fall, mounts astride of itas if it were a hobby-horse, and twirling the inside of hishemispheres of cocoanut around the sharp teeth of themother-of-pearl shell, the pure white meat falls in snowy showersinto the receptacle provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having obtained a quantity for hispurpose, he places it in a bag made of the net-like fibroussubstance attached to all cocoanut trees, and compressing it overthe bread-fruit, which being now sufficiently pounded, is putinto a wooden bowl--extracts a thick creamy milk.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deliciousliquid soon bubbles round the fruit, and leaves it at last justpeeping above its surface.</p><p> This preparation is called 'kokoo', and a most lusciouspreparation it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hobby-horse and the pestle and mortarwere in great requisition during the time I remained in the houseof Marheyo, and Kory-Kory had frequent occasion to show his skillin their use.</p><p> But the great staple articles of food into which the bread-fruitis converted by these natives are known respectively by the namesof Amar and Poee-Poee.</p><p> At a certain season of the year, when the fruit of the hundredgroves of the valley has reached its maturity, and hangs ingolden spheres from every branch, the islanders assemble inharvest groups, and garner in the abundance which surrounds them.</p><p> The trees are stripped of their nodding burdens, which, easilyfreed from the rind and core, are gathered together in capaciouswooden vessels, where the pulpy fruit is soon worked by a stonepestle, vigorously applied, into a blended mass of a doughyconsistency, called by the natives 'Tutao'.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is then dividedinto separate parcels, which, after being made up into stoutpackages, enveloped in successive folds of leaves, and boundround with thongs of bark, are stored away in large receptacleshollowed in the earth, from whence they are drawn as occasion mayrequire.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this condition the Tutao sometimes remains foryears, and even is thought to improve by age.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it is fitto be eaten, however, it has to undergo an additional process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aprimitive oven is scooped in the ground, and its bottom beingloosely covered with stones, a large fire is kindled within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the requisite degree of heat is attained, the embersare removed, and the surface of the stones being covered withthick layers of leaves, one of the large packages of Tutao isdeposited upon them and overspread with another layer of leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole is then quickly heaped up with earth, and forms asloping mound.</p><p> The Tutao thus baked is called 'Amar'; the action of the ovenhaving converted it into an amber-coloured caky substance, alittle tart, but not at all disagreeable to the taste.</p><p> By another and final process the 'Amar' is changed into'Poee-Poee'.&nbsp;&nbsp;This transition is rapidly effected.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amar isplaced in a vessel, and mixed with water until it gains a properpudding-like consistency, when, without further preparation, t isin readiness for use.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the form in which the 'Tutao' isgenerally consumed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The singular mode of eating it I havealready described.</p><p> Were it not that the bread-fruit is thus capable of beingpreserved for a length of time, the natives might be reduced to astate of starvation; for owing to some unknown cause the treessometimes fail to bear fruit; and on such occasions the islanderschiefly depend upon the supplies they have been enabled to storeaway.</p><p> This stately tree, which is rarely met with upon the SandwichIslands, and then only of a very inferior quality, and at Tahitidoes not abound to a degree that renders its fruit the principalarticle of food, attains its greatest excellence in the genialclimate of the Marquesan group, where it grows to an enormousmagnitude, and flourishes in the utmost abundance.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Sixteen</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p> MELANCHOLY CONDITION--OCCURRENCE AT THE TI--ANECDOTE OFMARHEYO--SHAVING THE HEAD OF A WARRIOR</p><p> IN looking back to this period, and calling to remembrance thenumberless proofs of kindness and respect which I received fromthe natives of the valley, I can scarcely understand how it wasthat, in the midst of so many consolatory circumstances, my mindshould still have been consumed by the most dismal forebodings,and have remained a prey to the profoundest melancholy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It istrue that the suspicious circumstances which had attended thedisappearance of Toby were enough of themselves to excitedistrust with regard to the savages, in whose power I felt myselfto be entirely placed, especially when it was combined with theknowledge that these very men, kind and respectful as they wereto me, were, after all, nothing better than a set of cannibals.</p><p> But my chief source of anxiety, and that which poisoned everytemporary enjoyment, was the mysterious disease in my leg, whichstill remained unabated.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the herbal applications of Tinor,united with the severer discipline of the old leech, and theaffectionate nursing of Kory-Kory, had failed to relieve me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iwas almost a cripple, and the pain I endured at intervals wasagonizing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unaccountable malady showed no signs ofamendment: on the contrary, its violence increased day by day,and threatened the most fatal results, unless some powerful meanswere employed to counteract it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed as if I were destinedto sink under this grievous affliction, or at least that it wouldhinder me from availing myself of any opportunity of escapingfrom the valley.</p><p> An incident which occurred as nearly as I can estimate aboutthree weeks after the disappearance of Toby, convinced me thatthe natives, from some reason or other, would interpose everypossible obstacle to my leaving them.</p><p> One morning there was no little excitement evinced by the peoplenear my abode, and which I soon discovered proceeded from a vaguereport that boats, had been seen at a great distance approachingthe bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately all was bustle and animation.&nbsp;&nbsp;It sohappened that day that the pain I suffered having somewhatabated, and feeling in much better spirits than usual, I hadcomplied with Kory-Kory's invitation to visit the chief Mehevi atthe place called the 'Ti', which I have before described as beingsituated within the precincts of the Taboo Groves.&nbsp;&nbsp;These sacredrecesses were at no great distance from Marheyo's habitation, andlay between it and the sea; the path that conducted to the beachpassing directly in front of the Ti, and thence skirting alongthe border of the groves.</p><p> I was reposing upon the mats, within the sacred building, incompany with Mehevi and several other chiefs, when theannouncement was first made.&nbsp;&nbsp;It sent a thrill of joy through mywhole frame;--perhaps Toby was about to return.&nbsp;&nbsp;I rose at onceto my feet, and my instinctive impulse was to hurry down to thebeach, equally regardless of the distance that separated me fromit, and of my disabled condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Mehevi noticed theeffect the intelligence had produced upon me, and the impatienceI betrayed to reach the sea, his countenance assumed thatinflexible rigidity of expression which had so awed me on theafternoon of our arrival at the house of Marheyo.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I wasproceeding to leave the Ti, he laid his hand upon my shoulder,and said gravely, 'abo, abo' (wait, wait).&nbsp;&nbsp;Solely intent uponthe one thought that occupied my mind, and heedless of hisrequest, I was brushing past him, when suddenly he assumed a toneof authority, and told me to 'moee' (sit down).&nbsp;&nbsp;Though struck bythe alteration in his demeanour, the excitement under which Ilaboured was too strong to permit me to obey the unexpectedcommand, and I was still limping towards the edge of the pi-piwith Kory-Kory clinging to one arm in his efforts to restrain me,when the natives around started to their feet, ranged themselvesalong the open front of the building, while Mehevi looked at mescowlingly, and reiterated his commands still more sternly.</p><p> It was at this moment, when fifty savage countenances wereglaring upon me, that I first truly experienced I was indeed acaptive in the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conviction rushed upon me withstaggering force, and I was overwhelmed by this confirmation ofmy worst fears.&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw at once that it was useless for me toresist, and sick at heart, I reseated myself upon the mats, andfor the moment abandoned myself to despair.</p><p> I now perceived the natives one after the other hurrying past theTi and pursuing the route that conducted to the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thesesavages, thought I, will soon be holding communication with someof my own countrymen perhaps, who with ease could restore me toliberty did they know of the situation I was in.&nbsp;&nbsp;No language candescribe the wretchedness which I felt; and in the bitterness ofmy soul I imprecated a thousand curses on the perfidious Toby,who had thus abandoned me to destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in vain thatKory-Kory tempted me with food, or lighted my pipe, or sought toattract my attention by performing the uncouth antics that hadsometimes diverted me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was fairly knocked down by this lastmisfortune, which, much as I had feared it, I had never beforehad the courage calmly to contemplate.</p><p> Regardless of everything but my own sorrow, I remained in the Tifor several hours, until shouts proceeding at intervals from thegroves beyond the house proclaimed the return of the natives fromthe beach.</p><p> Whether any boats visited the bay that morning or not, I nevercould ascertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;The savages assured me that there had not--butI was inclined to believe that by deceiving me in this particularthey sought to allay the violence of my grief.&nbsp;&nbsp;However thatmight be, this incident showed plainly that the Typees intendedto hold me a prisoner.&nbsp;&nbsp;As they still treated me with the samesedulous attention as before, I was utterly at a loss how toaccount for their singular conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I been in a situation toinstruct them in any of the rudiments of the mechanic arts, orhad I manifested a disposition to render myself in any way usefulamong them, their conduct might have been attributed to someadequate motive, but as it was, the matter seemed to meinexplicable.</p><p> During my whole stay on the island there occurred but two orthree instances where the natives applied to me with the view ofavailing themselves of my superior information; and these nowappear so ludicrous that I cannot forbear relating them.</p><p> The few things we had brought from Nukuheva had been done up intoa small bundle which we had carried with us in our descent to thevalley.&nbsp;&nbsp;This bundle, the first night of our arrival, I had usedas a pillow, but on the succeeding morning, opening it for theinspection of the natives, they gazed upon the miscellaneouscontents as though I had just revealed to them a casket ofdiamonds, and they insisted that so precious a treasure should beproperly secured.&nbsp;&nbsp;A line was accordingly attached to it, and theother end being passed over the ridge-pole of the house, it washoisted up to the apex of the roof, where it hung suspendeddirectly over the mats where I usually reclined.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I desiredanything from it I merely raised my finger to a bamboo beside me,and taking hold of the string which was there fastened, loweredthe package.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was exceedingly handy, and I took care to letthe natives understand how much I applauded the invention.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofthis package the chief contents were a razor with its case, asupply of needles and thread, a pound or two of tobacco and a fewyards of bright-coloured calico.</p><p> I should have mentioned that shortly after Toby's disappearance,perceiving the uncertainty of the time I might be obliged toremain in the valley--if, indeed, I ever should escape fromit--and considering that my whole wardrobe consisted of a shirtand a pair of trousers, I resolved to doff these garments atonce, in order to preserve them in a suitable condition for wearshould I again appear among civilized beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was consequentlyobliged to assume the Typee costume, a little altered, however,to suit my own views of propriety, and in which I have no doubt Iappeared to as much advantage as a senator of Rome enveloped inthe folds of his toga.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few folds of yellow tappa tucked aboutmy waist, descended to my feet in the style of a lady'spetticoat, only I did not have recourse to those voluminouspaddings in the rear with which our gentle dames are in the habitof augmenting the sublime rotundity of their figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thisusually comprised my in-door dress; whenever I walked out, Isuperadded to it an ample robe of the same material, whichcompletely enveloped my person, and screened it from the rays ofthe sun.</p><p> One morning I made a rent in this mantle; and to show theislanders with what facility it could be repaired, I lowered mybundle, and taking from it a needle and thread, proceeded tostitch up the opening.&nbsp;&nbsp;They regarded this wonderful applicationof science with intense admiration; and whilst I was stitchingaway, old Marheyo, who was one of the lookers-on, suddenlyclapped his hand to his forehead, and rushing to a corner of thehouse, drew forth a soiled and tattered strip of faded calicowhich he must have procured some time or other in traffic on thebeach--and besought me eagerly to exercise a little of my artupon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I willingly complied, though certainly so stumpy aneedle as mine never took such gigantic strides over calicobefore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The repairs completed, old Marheyo gave me a paternalhug; and divesting himself of his 'maro' (girdle), swathed thecalico about his loins, and slipping the beloved ornaments intohis ears, grasped his spear and sallied out of the house, like avaliant Templar arrayed in a new and costly suit of armour.</p><p> I never used my razor during my stay in the island, but althougha very subordinate affair, it had been vastly admired by theTypees; and Narmonee, a great hero among them, who wasexceedingly precise in the arrangements of his toilet and thegeneral adjustment of is person, being the most accuratelytattooed and laboriously horrified individual in all the valley,thought it would be a great advantage to have it applied to thealready shaven crown of his head.</p><p> The implement they usually employ is a shark's tooth, which isabout as well adapted to the purpose as a one-pronged fork forpitching hay.&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder, then, that the acute Narmonee perceivedthe advantage my razor possessed over the usual implement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, one day he requested as a personal favour that Iwould just run over his head with the razor.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply, I gavehim to understand that it was too dull, and could not be used toany purpose without being previously sharpened.&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist mymeaning, I went through an imaginary honing process on the palmof my hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Narmonee took my meaning in an instant, and runningout of the house, returned the next moment with a huge rough massof rock as big as a millstone, and indicated to me that that wasexactly the thing I wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there was nothing left forme but to proceed to business, and I began scraping away at agreat rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;He writhed and wriggled under the infliction, but,fully convinced of my skill, endured the pain like a martyr.</p><p> Though I never saw Narmonee in battle I will, from what I thenobserved, stake my life upon his courage and fortitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beforecommencing operations, his head had presented a surface of shortbristling hairs, and by the time I had concluded my unskilfuloperation it resembled not a little a stubble field after beinggone over with a harrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the chief expressed theliveliest satisfaction at the result, I was too wise to dissentfrom his opinion.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Seventeen</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p> IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH AND SPIRITS--FELICITY OF THE TYPEES--THEIRENJOYMENTS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF MORE ENLIGHTENEDCOMMUNITIES--COMPARATIVE WICKEDNESS OF CIVILIZED ANDUNENLIGHTENED PEOPLE--A SKIRMISH IN THE MOUNTAIN WITH THEWARRIORS OF HAPPAR</p><p> DAY after day wore on, and still there was no perceptible changein the conduct of the islanders towards me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gradually I lost allknowledge of the regular recurrence of the days of the week, andsunk insensibly into that kind of apathy which ensues after someviolent outburst of despair.&nbsp;&nbsp;My limb suddenly healed, theswelling went down, the pain subsided, and I had every reason tosuppose I should soon completely recover from the affliction thathad so long tormented me.</p><p> As soon as I was enabled to ramble about the valley in companywith the natives, troops of whom followed me whenever I salliedout of the house, I began to experience an elasticity of mindwhich placed me beyond the reach of those dismal forebodings towhich I had so lately been a prey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Received wherever I went withthe most deferential kindness; regaled perpetually with the mostdelightful fruits; ministered to by dark-eyed nymphs, andenjoying besides all the services of the devoted Kory-Kory, Ithought that, for a sojourn among cannibals, no man could havewell made a more agreeable one.</p><p> To be sure there were limits set to my wanderings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward thesea my progress was barred by an express prohibition of thesavages; and after having made two or three ineffectual attemptsto reach it, as much to gratify my curiousity as anything else, Igave up the idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in vain to think of reaching it bystealth, since the natives escorted me in numbers wherever Iwent, and not for one single moment that I can recall to mind wasI ever permitted to be alone.</p><p> The green and precipitous elevations that stood ranged around thehead of the vale where Marheyo's habitation was situatedeffectually precluded all hope of escape in that quarter, even ifI could have stolen away from the thousand eyes of the savages.</p><p> But these reflections now seldom obtruded upon me; I gave myselfup to the passing hour, and if ever disagreeable thoughts arosein my mind, I drove them away.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I looked around the verdantrecess in which I was buried, and gazed up to the summits of thelofty eminence that hemmed me in, I was well disposed to thinkthat I was in the 'Happy Valley', and that beyond those heightsthere was naught but a world of care and anxiety.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I extendedmy wanderings in the valley and grew more familiar with thehabits of its inmates, I was fain to confess that, despite thedisadvantages of his condition, the Polynesian savage, surroundedby all the luxurious provisions of nature, enjoyed an infinitelyhappier, though certainly a less intellectual existence than theself-complacent European.</p><p> The naked wretch who shivers beneath the bleak skies, and starvesamong the inhospitable wilds of Tierra-del-Fuego, might indeed bemade happier by civilization, for it would alleviate his physicalwants.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the voluptuous Indian, with every desire supplied,whom Providence has bountifully provided with all the sources ofpure and natural enjoyment, and from whom are removed so many ofthe ills and pains of life--what has he to desire at the hands ofCivilization?&nbsp;&nbsp;She may 'cultivate his mind--may elevate histhoughts,'--these I believe are the established phrases--but willhe be the happier?&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the once smiling and populous Hawiianislands, with their now diseased, starving, and dying natives,answer the question.&nbsp;&nbsp;The missionaries may seek to disguise thematter as they will, but the facts are incontrovertible; and thedevoutest Christian who visits that group with an unbiased mind,must go away mournfully asking--'Are these, alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;the fruits oftwenty-five years of enlightening?'</p><p> In a primitive state of society, the enjoyments of life, thoughfew and simple, are spread over a great extent, and areunalloyed; but Civilization, for every advantage she imparts,holds a hundred evils in reserve;--the heart-burnings, thejealousies, the social rivalries, the family dissentions, and thethousand self-inflicted discomforts of refined life, which makeup in units the swelling aggregate of human misery, are unknownamong these unsophisticated people.</p><p> But it will be urged that these shocking unprincipled wretchesare cannibals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very true; and a rather bad trait in theircharacter it must be allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are such only when theyseek to gratify the passion of revenge upon their enemies; and Iask whether the mere eating of human flesh so very far exceeds inbarbarity that custom which only a few years since was practisedin enlightened England:--a convicted traitor, perhaps a man foundguilty of honesty, patriotism, and suchlike heinous crimes, hadhis head lopped off with a huge axe, his bowels dragged cut andthrown into a fire; while his body, carved into four quarters,was with his head exposed upon pikes, and permitted to rot andfester among the public haunts of men!</p><p> The fiend-like skill we display in the invention of all manner ofdeath-dealing engines, the vindictiveness with which we carry onour wars, and the misery and desolation that follow in theirtrain, are enough of themselves to distinguish the whitecivilized man as the most ferocious animal on the face of theearth.</p><p> His remorseless cruelty is seen in many of the institutions ofour own favoured land.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one in particular lately adoptedin one of the States of the Union, which purports to have beendictated by the most merciful considerations.&nbsp;&nbsp;To destroy ourmalefactors piece-meal, drying up in their veins, drop by drop,the blood we are too chicken-hearted to shed by a single blowwhich would at once put a period to their sufferings, is deemedto be infinitely preferable to the old-fashioned punishment ofgibbeting--much less annoying to the victim, and more inaccordance with the refined spirit of the age; and yet how feebleis all language to describe the horrors we inflict upon thesewretches, whom we mason up in the cells of our prisons, andcondemn to perpetual solitude in the very heart of ourpopulation.</p><p> But it is needless to multiply the examples of civilizedbarbarity; they far exceed in the amount of misery they cause thecrimes which we regard with such abhorrence in our lessenlightened fellow-creatures.</p><p> The term 'Savage' is, I conceive, often misapplied, and indeed,when I consider the vices, cruelties, and enormities of everykind that spring up in the tainted atmosphere of a feverishcivilization, I am inclined to think that so far as the relativewickedness of the parties is concerned, four or five MarquesanIslanders sent to the United States as Missionaries might bequite as useful as an equal number of Americans despatched to theIslands in a similar capacity.</p><p> I once heard it given as an instance of the frightful depravityof a certain tribe in the Pacific that they had no word in theirlanguage to express the idea of virtue.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assertion wasunfounded; but were it otherwise, it might be met by stating thattheir language is almost entirely destitute of terms to expressthe delightful ideas conveyed by our endless catalogue ofcivilized crimes.</p><p> In the altered frame of mind to which I have referred, everyobject that presented itself to my notice in the valley struck mein a new light, and the opportunities I now enjoyed of observingthe manners of its inmates, tended to strengthen my favourableimpressions.&nbsp;&nbsp;One peculiarity that fixed my admiration was theperpetual hilarity reigning through the whole extent of the vale.</p><p> There seemed to be no cares, griefs, troubles, or vexations, inall Typee.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hours tripped along as gaily as the laughingcouples down a country dance.</p><p> There were none of those thousand sources of irritation that theingenuity of civilized man has created to mar his own felicity.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no foreclosures of mortgages, no protested notes, nobills payable, no debts of honour in Typee; no unreasonabletailors and shoemakers perversely bent on being paid; no duns ofany description and battery attorneys, to foment discord, backingtheir clients up to a quarrel, and then knocking their headstogether; no poor relations, everlastingly occupying the sparebed-chamber, and diminishing the elbow room at the family table;no destitute widows with their children starving on the coldcharities of the world; no beggars; no debtors' prisons; no proudand hard-hearted nabobs in Typee; or to sum up all in oneword--no Money!&nbsp;&nbsp;'That root of all evil' was not to be found inthe valley.</p><p> In this secluded abode of happiness there were no cross oldwomen, no cruel step-dames, no withered spinsters, no lovesickmaidens, no sour old bachelors, no inattentive husbands, nomelancholy young men, no blubbering youngsters, and no squallingbrats.&nbsp;&nbsp;All was mirth, fun and high good humour.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue devils,hypochondria, and doleful dumps, went and hid themselves amongthe nooks and crannies of the rocks.</p><p> Here you would see a parcel of children frolicking together thelive-long day, and no quarrelling, no contention, among them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same number in our own land could not have played togetherfor the space of an hour without biting or scratching oneanother.&nbsp;&nbsp;There you might have seen a throng of young females,not filled with envyings of each other's charms, nor displayingthe ridiculous affectations of gentility, nor yet moving inwhalebone corsets, like so many automatons, but free,inartificially happy, and unconstrained.</p><p> There were some spots in that sunny vale where they wouldfrequently resort to decorate themselves with garlands offlowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;To have seen them reclining beneath the shadows of oneof the beautiful groves; the ground about them strewn withfreshly gathered buds and blossoms, employed in weaving chapletsand necklaces, one would have thought that all the train of Florahad gathered together to keep a festival in honour of theirmistress.</p><p> With the young men there seemed almost always some matter ofdiversion or business on hand that afforded a constant variety ofenjoyment.&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether fishing, or carving canoes, or polishingtheir ornaments, never was there exhibited the least sign ofstrife or contention among them.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the warriors, theymaintained a tranquil dignity of demeanour, journeyingoccasionally from house to house, where they were always sure tobe received with the attention bestowed upon distinguishedguests.&nbsp;&nbsp;The old men, of whom there were many in the vale, seldomstirred from their mats, where they would recline for hours andhours, smoking and talking to one another with all the garrulityof age.</p><p> But the continual happiness, which so far as I was able to judgeappeared to prevail in the valley, sprang principally from thatall-pervading sensation which Rousseau has told us be at one timeexperienced, the mere buoyant sense of a healthful physicalexistence.&nbsp;&nbsp;And indeed in this particular the Typees had amplereason to felicitate themselves, for sickness was almost unknown.</p><p> During the whole period of my stay I saw but one invalid amongthem; and on their smooth skins you observed no blemish or markof disease.</p><p> The general repose, however, upon which I have just beendescanting, was broken in upon about this time by an event whichproved that the islanders were not entirely exempt from thoseoccurrences which disturb the quiet of more civilizedcommunities.</p><p> Having now been a considerable time in the valley, I began tofeel surprised that the violent hostility subsisting between itsinhabitants, and those of the adjoining bay of Happar, shouldnever have manifested itself in any warlike encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Althoughthe valiant Typees would often by gesticulations declare theirundying hatred against their enemies, and the disgust they feltat their cannibal propensities; although they dilated upon themanifold injuries they had received at their hands, yet with aforbearance truly commendable, they appeared to sit down undertheir grievances, and to refrain from making any reprisals.&nbsp;&nbsp;TheHappars, entrenched behind their mountains, and never evenshowing themselves on their summits, did not appear to me tofurnish adequate cause for that excess of animosity evincedtowards them by the heroic tenants of our vale, and I wasinclined to believe that the deeds of blood attributed to themhad been greatly exaggerated.</p><p> On the other hand, as the clamours of war had not up to thisperiod disturbed the serenity of the tribe, I began to distrustthe truth of those reports which ascribed so fierce andbelligerent a character to the Typee nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, thought I,all these terrible stories I have heard about the inveteracy withwhich they carried on the feud, their deadly intensity, of hatredand the diabolical malice with which they glutted their revengeupon the inanimate forms of the slain, are nothing more thanfables, and I must confess that I experienced something like asense of regret at having my hideous anticipations thusdisappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt in some sort like a 'prentice boy who,going to the play in the expectation of being delighted with acut-and-thrust tragedy, is almost moved to tears ofdisappointment at the exhibition of a genteel comedy.</p><p> I could not avoid thinking that I had fallen in with a greatlytraduced people, and I moralized not a little upon thedisadvantage of having a bad name, which in this instance&nbsp;&nbsp;hadgiven a tribe of savages, who were as pacific as so manylambkins, the reputation of a confederacy of giant-killers.</p><p> But subsequent events proved that I had been a little toopremature in coming to this conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;One, day about noon,happening to be at the Ti, I had lain down on the mats withseveral of the chiefs, and had gradually sunk into a mostluxurious siesta, when I was awakened by a tremendous outcry, andstarting up beheld the natives seizing their spears and hurryingout, while the most puissant of the chiefs, grasping the sixmuskets which were ranged against the bamboos, followed after,and soon disappeared in the groves.&nbsp;&nbsp;These movements wereaccompanied by wild shouts, in which 'Happar, Happar,' greatlypredominated.&nbsp;&nbsp;The islanders were now seen running past the Ti,and striking across the valley to the Happar side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently Iheard the sharp report of a musket from the adjoining hills, andthen a burst of voices in the same direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this the womenwho had congregated in the groves, set up the most violentclamours, as they invariably do here as elsewhere on everyoccasion of excitement and alarm, with a view of tranquillizingtheir own minds and disturbing other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;On this particularoccasion they made such an outrageous noise, and continued itwith such perseverance, that for awhile, had entire volleys ofmusketry been fired off in the neighbouring mountains, I shouldnot have been able to have heard them.</p><p> When this female commotion had a little subsided I listenedeagerly for further information.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last bang went another shot,and then a second volley of yells from the hills.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again all wasquiet, and continued so for such a length of time that I began tothink the contending armies had agreed upon a suspension ofhostilities; when pop went a third gun, followed as before with ayell.&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, for nearly two hours nothing occurred worthyof comment, save some straggling shouts from the hillside,sounding like the halloos of a parcel of truant boys who had lostthemselves in the woods.</p><p> During this interval I had remained standing on the piazza of the'Ti,' which directly fronted the Happar mountain, and with no onenear me but Kory-Kory and the old superannuated savages I havedescribed.&nbsp;&nbsp;These latter never stirred from their mats, andseemed altogether unconscious that anything unusual was going on.</p><p> As for Kory-Kory, he appeared to think that we were in the midstof great events, and sought most zealously to impress me with adue sense of their importance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every sound that reached usconveyed some momentous item of intelligence to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;At suchtimes, as if he were gifted with second sight, he would gothrough a variety of pantomimic illustrations, showing me theprecise manner in which the redoubtable Typees were at that verymoment chastising the insolence of the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mehevi hannapippee nuee Happar,' he exclaimed every five minutes, giving meto understand that under that distinguished captain the warriorsof his nation were performing prodigies of valour.</p><p> Having heard only four reports from the muskets, I was led tobelieve that they were worked by the islanders in the same manneras the Sultan Solyman's ponderous artillery at the siege ofByzantium, one of them taking an hour or two to load and train.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, no sound whatever proceeding from the mountains, Iconcluded that the contest had been determined one way or theother.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such appeared, indeed, to be the case, for in a littlewhile a courier arrived at the 'Ti', almost breathless with hisexertions, and communicated the news of a great victory havingbeen achieved by his countrymen: 'Happar poo arva!--Happar pooarva!' (the cowards had fled).&nbsp;&nbsp;Kory-Kory was in ecstasies, andcommenced a vehement harangue, which, so far as I understood it,implied that the result exactly agreed with his expectations, andwhich, moreover, was intended to convince me that it would be aperfectly useless undertaking, even for an army of fire-eaters,to offer battle to the irresistible heroes of our valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;In allthis I of course acquiesced, and looked forward with no littleinterest to the return of the conquerors, whose victory I fearedmight not have been purchased without cost to themselves.</p><p> But here I was again mistaken; for Mehevi, in conducting hiswarlike operations, rather inclined to the Fabian than to theBonapartean tactics, husbanding his resources and exposing histroops to no unnecessary hazards.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total loss of the victorsin this obstinately contested affair was, in killed, wounded, andmissing--one forefinger and part of a thumb-nail (which the lateproprietor brought along with him in his hand), a severelycontused arm, and a considerable effusion of blood flowing fromthe thigh of a chief, who had received an ugly thrust from aHappar spear.&nbsp;&nbsp;What the enemy had suffered I could not discover,but I presume they had succeeded in taking off with them thebodies of their slain.</p><p> Such was the issue of the battle, as far as its results cameunder my observation: and as it appeared to be considered anevent of prodigious importance, I reasonably concluded that thewars of the natives were marked by no very sanguinary traits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iafterwards learned how the skirmish had originated.&nbsp;&nbsp;A number ofthe Happars had been discovered prowling for no good purpose onthe Typee side of the mountain; the alarm sounded, and theinvaders, after a protracted resistance, had been chased over thefrontier.&nbsp;&nbsp;But why had not the intrepid Mehevi carried the warinto Happar?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why had he not made a descent into the hostilevale, and brought away some trophy of his victory--some materialsfor the cannibal entertainment which I had heard usuallyterminated every engagement?&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, I was much inclined tobelieve that these shocking festivals must occur very rarelyamong the islanders, if, indeed, they ever take place.</p><p> For two or three days the late event was the theme of generalcomment; after which the excitement gradually wore away, and thevalley resumed its accustomed tranquility.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Eighteen</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p> SWIMMING IN COMPANY WITH THE GIRLS OF THE VALLEY--ACANOE--EFFECTS OF THE TABOO--A PLEASURE EXCURSION ON THEPOND--BEAUTIFUL FREAK OF FAYAWAY--MANTUA-MAKING--A STRANGERARRIVES IN THE VALLEY--HIS MYSTERIOUS CONDUCT--NATIVEORATORY--THE INTERVIEW--ITS RESULTS--DEPARTURE OF THE STRANGER</p><p> RETURNING health and peace of mind gave a new interest toeverything around me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought to diversify my time by as manyenjoyments as lay within my reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathing in company withtroops of girls formed one of my chief amusements.&nbsp;&nbsp;We sometimesenjoyed the recreation in the waters of a miniature lake, towhich the central stream of the valley expanded.&nbsp;&nbsp;This lovelysheet of water was almost circular in figure, and about threehundred yards across.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its beauty was indescribable.&nbsp;&nbsp;All aroundits banks waved luxuriant masses of tropical foliage, soaringhigh above which were seen, here and there, the symmetrical shaftof the cocoanut tree, surmounted by its tufts of gracefulbranches, drooping in the air like so many waving ostrich plumes.</p><p> The ease and grace with which the maidens of the valley propelledthemselves through the water, and their familiarity with theelement, were truly astonishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the might be seengliding along just under the surface, without apparently movinghand or foot--then throwing themselves on their sides, theydarted through the water, revealing glimpses of their forms, as,in the course of their rapid progress, they shot for an instantpartly into the air--at one moment they dived deep down into thewater, and the next they rose bounding to the surface.</p><p> I remember upon one occasion plunging in among a parcel of theseriver-nymphs, and counting vainly on my superior strength, soughtto drag some of them under the water, but I quickly repented mytemerity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amphibious young creatures swarmed about me like ashoal of dolphins, and seizing hold of my devoted limbs, tumbledme about and ducked me under the surface, until from the strangenoises which rang in my ears, and the supernatural visionsdancing before my eyes, I thought I was in the land of thespirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood indeed as little chance among them as acumbrous whale attacked on all sides by a legion of swordfish.&nbsp;&nbsp;When at length they relinquished their hold of me, they swam awayin every direction, laughing at my clumsy endeavours to to reachthem.</p><p> There was no boat on the lake; but at my solicitation and for myspecial use, some of the,young men attached to Marheyo'shousehold, under the direction of the indefatigable Kory-Kory,brought up a light and tastefully carved canoe from the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Itwas launched upon the sheet of water, and floated there asgracefully as a swan.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, melancholy to relate, it produced aneffect I had not anticipated.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet nymphs, who had sportedwith me before on the lake, now all fled its vicinity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theprohibited craft, guarded by the edicts of the 'taboo,' extendedthe prohibition to the waters in which it lay.</p><p> For a few days, Kory-Kory, with one or two other youths,accompanied me in my excursions to the lake, and while I paddledabout in my light canoe, would swim after me shouting andgambolling in pursuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I as ever partial to what is termedin the 'Young Men's Own Book'--'the society of virtuous andintelligent young ladies;' and in the absence of the mermaids,the amusement became dull and insipid.&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning I expressedto my faithful servitor my desire for the return of the nymphs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The honest fellow looked at me bewildered for a moment,, and thenshook his head solemnly, and murmured 'taboo!&nbsp;&nbsp;taboo!' giving meto understand that unless the canoe was removed I could notexpect to have the young ladies back again.&nbsp;&nbsp;But to thisprocedure I was averse; I not only wanted the canoe to stay whereit was, but I wanted the beauteous Fayaway to get into it, andpaddle with me about the lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;This latter propositioncompletely horrified Kory-Kory's notions of propriety.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinveighed against it, as something too monstrous to be thoughtof.&nbsp;&nbsp;It not only shocked their established notions of propriety,but was at variance with all their religious ordinances.</p><p> However, although the 'taboo' was a ticklish thing to meddlewith, I determined to test its capabilities of resisting anattack.&nbsp;&nbsp;I consulted the chief Mehevi, who endeavoured todissuade me from my object; but I was not to be repulsed; andaccordingly increased the warmth of my solicitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last heentered into a long, and I have no doubt a very learned andeloquent exposition of the history and nature of the 'taboo' asaffecting this particular case; employing a variety of mostextraordinary words, which, from their amazing length andsonorousness, I have every reason to believe were of atheological nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;But all that he said failed to convince me:partly, perhaps, because I could not comprehend a word that heuttered; but chiefly, that for the life of me I could notunderstand why a woman would not have as much right to enter acanoe as a man.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he became a little more rational, andintimated that, out of the abundant love he bore me, he wouldconsult with the priests and see what could be done.</p><p> How it was that the priesthood of Typee satisfied the affair withtheir consciences, I know not; but so it was, and Fayawaydispensation from this portion of the taboo was at lengthprocured.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an event I believe never before had occurred inthe valley; but it was high time the islanders should be taught alittle gallantry, and I trust that the example I set them mayproduce beneficial effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridiculous, indeed, that the lovelycreatures should be obliged to paddle about in the water, like somany ducks, while a parcel of great strapping fellows skimmedover its surface in their canoes.</p><p> The first day after Fayaway's emancipation, I had a delightfullittle party on the lake--the damsels' Kory-Kory, and myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Myzealous body-servant brought from the house a calabash ofpoee-poee, half a dozen young cocoanuts--stripped of theirhusks--three pipes, as many yams, and me on his back a part ofthe way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something of a load; but Kory-Kory was a very strongman for his size, and by no means brittle in the spine.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had avery pleasant day; my trusty valet plied the paddle and swept usgently along the margin of the water, beneath the shades of theoverhanging thickets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fayaway and I reclined in the stern of thecanoe, on the very best terms possible with one another; thegentle nymph occasionally placing her pipe to her lip, andexhaling the mild fumes of the tobacco, to which her rosy breathadded a fresh perfume.&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange as it may seem, there is nothingin which a young and beautiful female appears to more advantagethan in the act of smoking.&nbsp;&nbsp;How captivating is a Peruvian lady,swinging in her gaily-woven hammock of grass, extended betweentwo orange-trees, and inhaling the fragrance of a choice cigarro!</p><p> But Fayaway, holding in her delicately formed olive hand the longyellow reed of her pipe, with its quaintly carved bowl, and everyfew moments languishingly giving forth light wreaths of vapourfrom her mouth and nostrils, looked still more engaging.</p><p> We floated about thus for several hours, when I looked up to thewarm, glowing, tropical sky, and then down into the transparentdepths below; and when my eye, wandering from the bewitchingscenery around, fell upon the grotesquely-tattooed form ofKory-Kory, and finally, encountered the pensive gaze of Fayaway,I thought I had been transported to some fairy region, so unrealdid everything appear.</p><p> This lovely piece of water was the coolest spot in all thevalley, and I now made it a place of continual resort during thehottest period of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;One side of it lay near thetermination of a long gradually expanding gorge, which mounted tothe heights that environed the vale.&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong trade wind, metin its course by these elevations, circled and eddied about theirsummits, and was sometimes driven down the steep ravine and sweptacross the valley, ruffling in its passage the otherwise tranquilsurface of the lake.</p><p> One day, after we had been paddling about for some time, Idisembarked Kory-Kory, and paddled the canoe to the windward sideof the lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I turned the canoe, Fayaway, who was with me,seemed all at once to be struck with some happy idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;With awild exclamation of delight, she disengaged from her person theample robe of tappa which was knotted over her shoulder (for thepurpose of shielding her from the sun), and spreading it out likea sail, stood erect with upraised arms in the head of the canoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;We American sailors pride ourselves upon our straight, cleanspars, but a prettier little mast than Fayaway made was nevershipped aboard of any craft.</p><p> In a moment the tappa was distended by the breeze--the long browntresses of Fayaway streamed in the air--and the canoe glidedrapidly through the water, and shot towards the shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated inthe stem, I directed its course with my paddle until it dashed upthe soft sloping bank, and Fayaway, with a light spring alightedon the ground; whilst Kory-Kory, who had watched our manoeuvreswith admiration, now clapped his hands in transport, and shoutedlike a madman.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a time afterwards was this feat repeated.</p><p> If the reader has not observed ere this that I was the declaredadmirer of Miss Fayaway, all I can say is that he is littleconversant with affairs of the heart, and I certainly shall nottrouble myself to enlighten him any farther.&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the calico Ihad brought from the ship I made a dress for this lovely girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;In it she looked, I must confess, something like an opera-dancer.</p><p> The drapery of the latter damsel generally commences a littleabove the elbows, but my island beauty's began at the waist, andterminated sufficiently far above the ground to reveal the mostbewitching ankle in the universe.</p><p> The day that Fayaway first wore this robe was rendered memorableby a new acquaintance being introduced to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon Iwas lying in the house when I heard a great uproar outside; butbeing by this time pretty well accustomed to the wild hallooswhich were almost continually ringing through the valley, I paidlittle attention to it, until old Marheyo, under the influence ofsome strange excitement, rushed into my presence and communicatedthe astounding tidings, 'Marnoo pemi!' which being interpreted,implied that an individual by the name of Marnoo was approaching.</p><p> My worthy old friend evidently expected that this intelligencewould produce a great effect upon me, and for a time he stoodearnestly regarding me, as if curious to see how I should conductmyself, but as I remained perfectly unmoved, the old gentlemandarted out of the house again, in as great a hurry as he hadentered it.</p><p> 'Marnoo, Marnoo,' cogitated I, 'I have never heard that namebefore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distinguished character, I presume, from theprodigious riot the natives are making;' the tumultuous noisedrawing nearer and nearer every moment, while 'Marnoo!--Marnoo!'was shouted by every tongue.</p><p> I made up my mind that some savage warrior of consequence, whohad not yet enjoyed the honour of an audience, was desirous ofpaying his respects on the present occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;So vain had Ibecome by the lavish attention to which I had been accustomed,that I felt half inclined, as a punishment for such neglect, togive this Marnoo a cold reception, when the excited throng camewithin view, convoying one of the most striking specimens ofhumanity that I ever beheld.</p><p> The stranger could not have been more than twenty-five years ofage, and was a little above the ordinary height; had he a singlehair's breadth taller, the matchless symmetry of his form wouldhave been destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;His unclad limbs were beautifully formed;whilst the elegant outline of his figure, together with hisbeardless cheeks, might have entitled him to the distinction ofstanding for the statue of the Polynesian Apollo; and indeed theoval of his countenance and the regularity of every featurereminded one of an antique bust.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the marble repose of artwas supplied by a warmth and liveliness of expression only to beseen in the South Sea Islander under the most favourabledevelopments of nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair of Marnoo was a rich curlingbrown, and twined about his temples and neck in little closecurling ringlets, which danced up and down continually, when hewas animated in conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;His cheek was of a femininesoftness, and his face was free from the least blemish oftattooing, although the rest of his body was drawn all over withfanciful figures, which--unlike the unconnected sketching usualamong these natives--appeared to have been executed in conformitywith some general design.</p><p> The tattooing on his back in particular attracted my attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;The artist employed must indeed have excelled in his profession.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traced along the course of the spine was accurately delineatedthe slender, tapering and diamond checkered shaft of thebeautiful 'artu' tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Branching from the stem on each side, anddisposed alternately, were the graceful branches drooping withleaves all correctly drawn and elaborately finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed thebest specimen of the Fine Arts I had yet seen in Typee.&nbsp;&nbsp;A rearview of the stranger might have suggested the idea of a spreadingvine tacked against a garden wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his breast, arms andlegs, were exhibited an infinite variety of figures; every one ofwhich, however, appeared to have reference to the general effectsought to be produced.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tattooing I have described was of thebrightest blue, and when contrasted with the light olive-colourof the skin, produced an unique and even elegant effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aslight girdle of white tappa, scarcely two inches in width, buthanging before and behind in spreading tassels, composed theentire costume of the stranger.</p><p> He advanced surrounded by the islanders, carrying under one arm asmall roll of native cloth, and grasping in his other hand a longand richly decorated spear.&nbsp;&nbsp;His manner was that of a travellerconscious that he is approaching a comfortable stage in hisjourney.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every moment he turned good-humouredly on the throngaround him, and gave some dashing sort of reply to theirincessant queries, which appeared to convulse them withuncontrollable mirth.</p><p> Struck by his demeanour, and the peculiarity of his appearance,so unlike that of the shaven-crowned and face-tattooed natives ingeneral, I involuntarily rose as he entered the house, andproffered him a seat on the mats beside me.&nbsp;&nbsp;But without deigningto notice the civility, or even the more incontrovertible fact ofmy existence, the stranger passed on, utterly regardless of me,and flung himself upon the further end of the long couch thattraversed the sole apartment of Marheyo's habitation.</p><p> Had the belle of the season, in the pride of her beauty andpower, been cut in a place of public resort by some superciliousexquisite, she could not have felt greater indignation than I didat this unexpected slight.</p><p> I was thrown into utter astonishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct of the savageshad prepared me to anticipate from every newcomer the sameextravagant expressions of curiosity and regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;The singularityof his conduct, however, only roused my desire to discover whothis remarkable personage might be, who now engrossed theattention of every one.</p><p> Tinor placed before him a calabash of poee-poee, from which thestranger regaled himself, alternating every mouthful with somerapid exclamation, which was eagerly caught up and echoed by thecrowd that completely filled the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I observed thestriking devotion of the natives to him, and their temporarywithdrawal of all attention from myself, I felt not a littlepiqued.&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of Tommo is departed, thought I, and thesooner he removes from the valley the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were myfeelings at the moment, and they were prompted by that gloriousprinciple inherent in all heroic natures--the strong-rooteddetermination to have the biggest share of the pudding or to gowithout any of it.</p><p> Marnoo, that all-attractive personage, having satisfied hishunger and inhaled a few whiffs from a pipe which was handed tohim, launched out into an harangue which completely enchained theattention of his auditors.</p><p> Little as I understood of the language, yet from his animatedgestures and the varying expression of his features--reflected asfrom so many mirrors in the countenances around him, I couldeasily discover the nature of those passions which he sought toarouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the frequent recurrence of the words 'Nukuheva' and'Frannee' (French), and some others with the meaning of which Iwas acquainted, he appeared to be rehearsing to his auditorsevents which had recently occurred in the neighbouring bays.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buthow he had gained the knowledge of these matters I could notunderstand, unless it were that he had just come from Nukuheva--asupposition which his travel-stained appearance not a littlesupported.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if a native of that region, I could not accountfor his friendly reception at the hands of the Typees.</p><p> Never, certainly, had I beheld so powerful an exhibition ofnatural eloquence as Marnoo displayed during the course of hisoration.&nbsp;&nbsp;The grace of the attitudes into which he threw hisflexible figure, the striking gestures of his naked arms, andabove all, the fire which shot from his brilliant eyes, impartedan effect to the continually changing accents of his voice, ofwhich the most accomplished orator might have been proud.&nbsp;&nbsp;At onemoment reclining sideways upon the mat, and leaning calmly uponhis bended arm, he related circumstantially the aggressions ofthe French--their hostile visits to the surrounding bays,enumerating each one in succession--Happar, Puerka, Nukuheva,Tior,--and then starting to his feet and precipitating himselfforward with clenched hands and a countenance distorted withpassion, he poured out a tide of invectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling back intoan attitude of lofty command, he exhorted the Typees to resistthese encroachments; reminding them, with a fierce glance ofexultation, that as yet the terror of their name had preservedthem from attack, and with a scornful sneer he sketched inironical terms the wondrous intrepidity of the French, who, withfive war-canoes and hundreds of men, had not dared to assail thenaked warriors of their valley.</p><p> The effect he produced upon his audience was electric; one andall they stood regarding him with sparkling eyes and tremblinglimbs, as though they were listening to the inspired voice of aprophet.</p><p> But it soon appeared that Marnoo's powers were as versatile asthey were extraordinary.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he had finished his vehementharangue, he threw himself again upon the mats, and, singling outindividuals in the crowd, addressed them by name, in a sort ofbantering style, the humour of which, though nearly hidden fromme filled the whole assembly with uproarious delight.</p><p> He had a word for everybody; and, turning rapidly from one toanother, gave utterance to some hasty witticism, which was sureto be followed by peals of laughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the females as well asto the men, he addressed his discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven only knows whathe said to them, but he caused smiles and blushes to mantle theiringenuous faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, indeed, very much inclined to believethat Marnoo, with his handsome person and captivating manners,was a sad deceiver among the simple maidens of the island.</p><p> During all this time he had never, for one moment, deigned toregard me.&nbsp;&nbsp;He appeared, indeed, to be altogether unconscious ofmy presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was utterly at a loss how to account for thisextraordinary conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;I easily perceived that he was a man ofno little consequence among the islanders; that he possesseduncommon talents; and was gifted with a higher degree ofknowledge than the inmates of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Itherefore greatly feared lest having, from some cause or other,unfriendly feelings towards me, he might exert his powerfulinfluence to do me mischief.</p><p> It seemed evident that he was not a permanent resident of thevale, and yet, whence could he have come?&nbsp;&nbsp;On all sides theTypees were girt in by hostile tribes, and how could he possibly,if belonging to any of these, be received with so muchcordiality?</p><p> The person appearance of the enigmatical stranger suggestedadditional perplexities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The face, free from tattooing, and theunshaven crown, were peculiarities I had never before remarked inany part of the island, end I had always heard that the contrarywere considered the indispensable distinction of a Marquesanwarrior.&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether the matter was perfectly incomprehensible tome, and I awaited its solution with no small degree of anxiety.</p><p> At length, from certain indications, I suspected that he wasmaking me the subject of his remarks, although he appearedcautiously to avoid either pronouncing my name, or looking in thedirection where I lay.&nbsp;&nbsp;All at once he rose from the mats wherehe had been reclining, and, still conversing, moved towards me,his eye purposely evading mine, and seated himself within lessthan a yard of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had hardly recovered from my surprise, whenhe suddenly turned round, and, with a most benignant countenanceextended his right hand gracefully towards me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Iaccepted the courteous challenge, and, as soon as our palms met,he bent towards me, and murmured in musical accents--'How youdo?'&nbsp;&nbsp;'How long you been in this bay?'&nbsp;&nbsp;'You like this bay?'</p><p> Had I been pierced simultaneously by three Happar spears, I couldnot have started more than I did at hearing these simplequestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment I was overwhelmed with astonishment, andthen answered something I know not what; but as soon as Iregained my self-possession, the thought darted through my mindthat from this individual I might obtain that informationregarding Toby which I suspected the natives had purposelywithheld from me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly I questioned him concerning thedisappearance of my companion, but he denied all knowledge of thematter.&nbsp;&nbsp;I then inquired from whence he had come?&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied,from Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I expressed my surprise, he looked at me fora moment, as if enjoying my perplexity, and then with his strangevivacity, exclaimed,--'Ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;me taboo,--me go Nukuheva,--me goTior,--me go Typee,--me go everywhere,--nobody harm me,--metaboo.'</p><p> This explanation would have been altogether unintelligible to me,had it not recalled to my mind something I had previously heardconcerning a singular custom among these islanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though thecountry is possessed by various tribes, whose mutual hostilitiesalmost wholly prelude any intercourse between them; yet there areinstances where a person having ratified friendly relations withsome individual belonging longing to the valley, whose inmatesare at war with his own, may, under particular restrictions,venture with impunity into the country of his friend, where,under other circumstances, he would have been treated as anenemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light are personal friendships regarded amongthem, and the individual so protected is said to be 'taboo', andhis person, to a certain extent, is held as sacred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus thestranger informed me he had access to all the valleys in theisland.</p><p> Curious to know how he had acquired his knowledge of English, Iquestioned him on the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, for some reason orother, he evaded the inquiry, but afterwards told me that, when aboy, he had been carried to sea by the captain of a tradingvessel, with whom he had stayed three years, living part of thetime with him at Sidney in Australia, and that at a subsequentvisit to the island, the captain had, at his own request,permitted him to remain among his countrymen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The naturalquickness of the savage had been wonderfully improved by hisintercourse with the white men, and his partial knowledge of aforeign language gave him a great ascendancy over his lessaccomplished countrymen.</p><p> When I asked the now affable Marnoo why it was that he had notpreviously spoken to me, he eagerly inquired what I had been ledto think of him from his conduct in that respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;I replied,that I had supposed him to be some great chief or warrior, whohad seen plenty of white men before, and did not think it worthwhile to notice a poor sailor.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this declaration of theexalted opinion I had formed of him, he appeared vastlygratified, and gave me to understand that he had purposelybehaved in that manner, in order to increase my astonishment, assoon as he should see proper to address me.</p><p> Marnoo now sought to learn my version of the story as to how Icame to be an inmate of the Typee valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I related to himthe circumstances under which Toby and I had entered it, helistened with evident interest; but as soon as I alluded to theabsence, yet unaccounted for, of my comrade, he endeavoured tochange the subject, as if it were something he desired not toagitate.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed, indeed, as if everything connected with Tobywas destined to beget distrust and anxiety in my bosom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding Marnoo's denial of any knowledge of his fate, Icould not avoid suspecting that he was deceiving me; and thissuspicion revived those frightful apprehensions with regard to myown fate, which, for a short time past, had subsided in mybreast.</p><p> Influenced by these feelings, I now felt a strong desire to availmyself of the stranger's protection, and under his safeguard toreturn to Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;But as soon as I hinted at this, heunhesitatingly pronounced it to be entirely impracticable;assuring me that the Typees would never consent to my leaving thevalley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although what he said merely confirmed the impressionwhich I had before entertained, still it increased my anxiety toescape from a captivity which, however endurable, nay, delightfulit might be in some respects, involved in its issues a fatemarked by the most frightful contingencies.</p><p> I could not conceal from my mind that Toby had been treated inthe same friendly manner as I had been, and yet all theirkindness terminated with his mysterious disappearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Might notthe same fate await me?--a fate too dreadful to think of.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stimulated by these considerations, I urged anew my request toMarnoo; but he only set forth in stronger colours theimpossibility of my escape, and repeated his previous declarationthat the Typees would never be brought to consent to mydeparture.</p><p> When I endeavoured to learn from him the motives which promptedthem to hold me a prisoner, Marnoo again presumed that mysterioustone which had tormented me with apprehension when I hadquestioned him with regard to the fate of my companion.</p><p> Thus repulsed, in a manner which only served, by arousing themost dreadful forebodings, to excite me to renewed attempts, Iconjured him to intercede for me with the natives, and endeavourto procure their consent to my leaving them.&nbsp;&nbsp;To this he appearedstrongly averse; but, yielding at last to my importunities, headdressed several of the chiefs, who with the rest had beeneyeing us intently during the whole of our conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hispetition, however, was at once met with the most violentdisapprobation, manifesting itself in angry glances and gestures,and a perfect torrent of passionate words, directed to both himand myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marnoo, evidently repenting the step he had taken,earnestly deprecated the resentment of the crowd, and, in a fewmoments succeeded in pacifying to some extent the clamours whichhad broken out as soon as his proposition had been understood.</p><p> With the most intense interest had I watched the reception hisintercession might receive; and a bitter pang shot through myheart at the additional evidence, now furnished, of theunchangeable determination of the islanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marnoo told me withevident alarm in his countenance, that although admitted into thebay on a friendly footing with its inhabitants, he could notpresume to meddle with their concerns, as such procedure, ifpersisted in, would at once absolve the Typees from therestraints of the 'taboo', although so long as he refrained fromsuch conduct, it screened him effectually from the consequencesof the enmity they bore his tribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Mehevi, whowas present, angrily interrupted him; and the words which heuttered in a commanding tone, evidently meant that he must atonce cease talking to me and withdraw to the other part of thehouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marnoo immediately started up, hurriedly enjoining me notto address him again, and as I valued my safety, to refrain fromall further allusion to the subject of my departure; and then, incompliance with the order of the determined chief, but not beforeit had again been angrily repeated, he withdrew to a distance.</p><p> I now perceived, with no small degree of apprehension, the samesavage expression in the countenances of the natives, which hadstartled me during the scene at the Ti.&nbsp;&nbsp;They glanced their eyessuspiciously from Marnoo to me, as if distrusting the nature ofan intercourse carried on, as it was, in a language they couldnot understand, and they seemed to harbour the belief thatalready we had concerted measures calculated to elude theirvigilance.</p><p> The lively countenances of these people are wonderfullyindicative of the emotions of the soul, and the imperfections oftheir oral language are more than compensated for by the nervouseloquence of their looks and gestures.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could plainly trace, inevery varying expression of their faces, all those passions whichhad been thus unexpectedly aroused in their bosoms.</p><p> It required no reflection to convince me, from what was going on,that the injunction of Marnoo was not to be rashly lighted ,andaccordingly, great as was the effort to suppress my feelings, Iaccosted Mehevi in a good-humoured tone, with a view ofdissipating any ill impression he might have received.&nbsp;&nbsp;But theireful, angry chief was not so easily mollified.&nbsp;&nbsp;He rejected myadvances with that peculiarly stern expression I have beforedescribed, and took care by the whole of his behaviour towards meto show the displeasure and resentment which he felt.</p><p> Marnoo, at the other extremity of the house, apparently desirousof making a diversion in my favour, exerted himself to amuse withhis pleasantries the crowd about him; but his lively attemptswere not so successful as they had previously been, and, foiledin his efforts, he rose gravely to depart.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one expressed anyregret at this movement, so seizing his roll of tappa, andgrasping his spear, he advanced to the front of the pi-pi, andwaving his hand in adieu to the now silent throng, cast upon me aglance of mingled pity and reproach, and flung himself into thepath which led from the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched his receding figureuntil it was lost in the obscurity of the grove, and then gavemyself up to the most desponding reflections.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Nineteen</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p> REFLECTIONS AFTER MARNOO'S DEPARTURE-BATTLE OF THEPOP-GUNS--STRANGE CONCEIT OF MARHEYO--PROCESS OF MAKING TAPPA</p><p> THE knowledge I had now obtained as to the intention of thesavages deeply affected me.</p><p> Marnoo, I perceived, was a man who, by reason of his superioracquirements, and the knowledge he possessed of the events whichwere taking place in the different bays of the island, was heldin no little estimation by the inhabitants of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;He hadbeen received with the most cordial welcome and respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thenatives had hung upon the accents of his voice, and, hadmanifested the highest gratification at being individuallynoticed by him.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet despite all this, a few words urged inmy behalf, with the intent of obtaining my release fromcaptivity, had sufficed not only to banish all harmony andgood-will; but, if I could believe what he told me, had gone onto endanger his own personal safety.</p><p> How strongly rooted, then, must be the determination of theTypees with regard to me, and how suddenly could they display thestrangest passions!&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere suggestion of my departure hadestranged from me, for the time at least, Mehevi, who was themost influential of all the chiefs, and who had previouslyexhibited so many instances of his; friendly sentiments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therest of the natives had likewise evinced their strong repugnanceto my wishes, and even Kory-Kory himself seemed to share in thegeneral disapprobation bestowed upon me.</p><p> In vain I racked my invention to find out some motive for them,but I could discover none.</p><p> But however this might be, the scene which had just occurredadmonished me of the danger of trifling with the wayward andpassionate spirits against whom it was vain to struggle, andmight even be fatal to do go.&nbsp;&nbsp;My only hope was to induce thenatives to believe that I was reconciled to my detention in thevalley, and by assuming a tranquil and cheerful demeanour, toallay the suspicions which I had so unfortunately aroused.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirconfidence revived, they might in a short time remit in somedegree their watchfulness over my movements, and I should then bethe better enabled to avail myself of any opportunity whichpresented itself for escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;I determined, therefore, to makethe best of a bad bargain, and to bear up manfully againstwhatever might betide.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this endeavour, I succeeded beyond myown expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the period of Marnoo's visit, I had been inthe valley, as nearly as I could conjecture, some two months.Although not completely recovered from my strange illness, whichstill lingered about me, I was free from pain and able to takeexercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I had every reason to anticipate a perfectrecovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Freed from apprehension on this point, and resolved toregard the future without flinching, I flung myself anew into allthe social pleasures of the valley, and sought to bury allregrets, and all remembrances of my previous existence in thewild enjoyments it afforded.</p><p> In my various wanderings through the vale, and as I became betteracquainted with the character of its inhabitants, I was more andmore struck with the light-hearted joyousness that everywhereprevailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The minds of these simple savages, unoccupied bymatters of graver moment, were capable of deriving the utmostdelight from circumstances which would have passed unnoticed inmore intelligent communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;All their enjoyment, indeed,seemed to be made up of the little trifling incidents of thepassing hour; but these diminutive items swelled altogether to anamount of happiness seldom experienced by more enlightenedindividuals, whose pleasures are drawn from more elevated butrarer sources.</p><p> What community, for instance, of refined and intellectual mortalswould derive the least satisfaction from shooting pop-guns?&nbsp;&nbsp;Themere supposition of such a thing being possible would excitetheir indignation, and yet the whole population of Typee didlittle else for ten days but occupy themselves with that childishamusement, fairly screaming, too, with the delight it affordedthem.</p><p> One day I was frolicking with a little spirited urchin, some sixyears old, who chased me with a piece of bamboo about three feetlong, with which he occasionally belaboured me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizing thestick from him, the idea happened to suggest itself, that I mightmake for the youngster, out of the slender tube, one of thosenursery muskets with which I had sometimes seen children playing.</p><p> Accordingly, with my knife I made two parallel slits in the caneseveral inches in length, and cutting loose at one end theelastic strip between them, bent it back and slipped the pointinto a little notch made for the purse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any small substanceplaced against this would be projected with considerable forcethrough the tube, by merely springing the bent strip out of thenotch.</p><p> Had I possessed the remotest idea of the sensation this piece ofordnance was destined to produce, I should certainly have takenout a patent for the invention.&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy scampered away with it,half delirious with ecstasy, and in twenty minutes afterwards Imight have been seen surrounded by a noisy crowd--venerable oldgraybeards--responsible fathers of families--valiantwarriors--matrons--young men--girls and children, all holding intheir hands bits of bamboo, and each clamouring to be servedfirst.</p><p> For three or four hours I was engaged in manufacturing pop-guns,but at last made over my good-will and interest in the concern toa lad of remarkably quick parts, whom I soon initiated into theart and mystery.</p><p> Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop, now resounded all over the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Duels,skirmishes, pitched battles, and general engagements were to beseen on every side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, as you walked along a path which ledthrough a thicket, you fell into a cunningly laid ambush, andbecame a target for a body of musketeers whose tattooed limbs youcould just see peeping into view through the foliage.&nbsp;&nbsp;There youwere assailed by the intrepid garrison of a house, who levelledtheir bamboo rifles at you from between the upright canes whichcomposed its sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther on you were fired upon by adetachment of sharpshooters, mounted upon the top of a pi-pi.</p><p> Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop!&nbsp;&nbsp;green guavas, seeds, and berries were flyingabout in every direction, and during this dangerous state ofaffairs I was half afraid that, like the man and his brazen bull,I should fall a victim to my own ingenuity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like everythingelse, however, the excitement gradually wore away, though everafter occasionally pop-guns might be heard at all hours of theday.</p><p> It was towards the close of the pop-gun war, that I wasinfinitely diverted with a strange freak of Marheyo's.</p><p> I had worn, when I quitted the ship, a pair of thick pumps,which, from the rough usage they had received in scalingprecipices and sliding down gorges, were so dilapidated as to bealtogether unfit for use--so, at least, would have thought thegenerality of people, and so they most certainly were, whenconsidered in the light of shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;But things unservicable in oneway, may with advantage be applied in another, that is, if onehave genius enough for the purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;This genius Marheyopossessed in a superlative degree, as he abundantly evinced bythe use to which he put those sorely bruised and battered oldshoes.</p><p> Every article, however trivial, which belonged to me, the nativesappeared to regard as sacred; and I observed that for severaldays after becoming an inmate of the house, my pumps weresuffered to remain, untouched, where I had first happened tothrow them.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered, however, that after awhile I hadmissed them from their accustomed place; but the matter gave meno concern, supposing that Tinor--like any other tidy housewife,having come across them in some of her domestic occupations--hadpitched the useless things out of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was soonundeceived.</p><p> One day I observed old Marheyo bustling about me with unusualactivity, and to such a degree as almost to supersede Kory-Koryin the functions of his office.&nbsp;&nbsp;One moment he volunteered totrot off with me on his back to the stream; and when I refused,noways daunted by the repulse, he continued to frisk about melike a superannuated house-dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not for the life of meconjecture what possessed the old gentleman, until all at once,availing himself of the temporary absence of the household, hewent through a variety of of uncouth gestures, pointing eagerlydown to my feet, then up to a little bundle, which swung from theridge pole overhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last I caught a faint idea of hismeaning, and motioned him to lower the package.&nbsp;&nbsp;He executed theorder in the twinkling of an eye, and unrolling a piece of tappa,displayed to my astonished gaze the identical pumps which Ithought had been destroyed long before.</p><p> I immediately comprehended his desire, and very generously gavehim the shoes, which had become quite mouldy, wondering for whatearthly purpose he could want them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same afternoon Idescried the venerable warrior approaching the house, with aslow, stately gait, ear-rings in ears, and spear in hand, withthis highly ornamental pair of shoes suspended from his neck by astrip of bark, and swinging backwards and forwards on hiscapacious chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gala costume of the tasteful Marheyo,these calf-skin pendants ever after formed the most strikingfeature.</p><p> But to turn to something a little more important.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although thewhole existence of the inhabitants of the valley seemed to passaway exempt from toil, yet there were some light employmentswhich, although amusing rather than laborious as occupations,contributed to their comfort and luxury.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these the mostimportant was the manufacture of the native cloth,--'tappa',--sowell known, under various modifications, throughout the wholePolynesian Archipelago.&nbsp;&nbsp;As is generally understood, this usefuland sometimes elegant article is fabricated from the bark ofdifferent trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as I believe that no description of itsmanufacture has ever been given, I shall state what I knowregarding it.</p><p> In the manufacture of the beautiful white tappa generally worn onthe Marquesan Islands, the preliminary operation consists ingathering a certain quantity of the young branches of thecloth-tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;The exterior green bark being pulled off asworthless, there remains a slender fibrous substance, which iscarefully stripped from the stick, to which it closely adheres.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a sufficient quantity of it has been collected, the variousstrips are enveloped in a covering of large leaves, which thenatives use precisely as we do wrapping-paper, and which aresecured by a few turns of a line passed round them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The packageis then laid in the bed of some running stream, with a heavystone placed over it, to prevent its being swept away.&nbsp;&nbsp;After ithas remained for two or three days in this state, it is drawnout, and exposed, for a short time, to the action of the air,every distinct piece being attentively inspected, with a view ofascertaining whether it has yet been sufficiently affected by theoperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is repeated again and again, until the desiredresult is obtained.</p><p> When the substance is in a proper state for the next process, itbetrays evidences of incipient decomposition; the fibres arerelaxed and softened, and rendered perfectly malleable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thedifferent strips are now extended, one by one, in successivelayers, upon some smooth surface--generally the prostrate trunkof a cocoanut tree--and the heap thus formed is subjected, atevery new increase, to a moderate beating, with a sort of woodenmallet, leisurely applied.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mallet is made of a hard heavywood resembling ebony, is about twelve inches in length, andperhaps two in breadth, with a rounded handle at one end, and inshape is the exact counterpart of one of our four-sidedrazor-strops.&nbsp;&nbsp;The flat surfaces of the implement are marked withshallow parallel indentations, varying in depth on the differentsides, so as to be adapted to the several stages of theoperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;These marks produce the corduroy sort of stripesdiscernible in the tappa in its finished state.&nbsp;&nbsp;After beingbeaten in the manner I have described, the material soon becomesblended in one mass, which, moistened occasionally with water, isat intervals hammered out, by a kind of gold-beating process, toany degree of thinness required.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way the cloth is easilymade to vary in strength and thickness, so as to suit thenumerous purposes to which it is applied.</p><p> When the operation last described has been concluded, thenew-made tappa is spread out on the grass to bleach and dry, andsoon becomes of a dazzling whiteness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, in the firststages of the manufacture, the substance is impregnated with avegetable juice, which gives it a permanent colour.&nbsp;&nbsp;A rich brownand a bright yellow are occasionally seen, but the simple tasteof the Typee people inclines them to prefer the natural tint.</p><p> The notable wife of Kamehameha, the renowned conqueror and kingof the Sandwich Islands, used to pride herself in the skill shedisplayed in dyeing her tappa with contrasting colours disposedin regular figures; and, in the midst of the innovations of thetimes, was regarded, towards the decline of her life, as a ladyof the old school, clinging as she did to the national cloth, inpreference to the frippery of the European calicoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the artof printing the tappa is unknown upon the Marquesan Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inpassing along the valley, I was often attracted by the noise ofthe mallet, which, when employed in the manufacture of the clothproduces at every stroke of its hard, heavy wood, a clear,ringing, and musical sound, capable of being heard at a greatdistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;When several of these implements happen to be inoperation at the same time, near one another, the effect upon theear of a person, at a little distance, is really charming.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twenty</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p> HISTORY OF A DAY AS USUALLY SPENT IN TYPEE VALLEY--DANCES OF THEMARQUESAN GIRLS</p><p> NOTHING can be more uniform and undiversified than the life ofthe Typees; one tranquil day of ease and happiness followsanother in quiet succession; and with these unsophisicatedsavages the history of a day is the history of a life.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will,therefore, as briefly as I can, describe one of our days in thevalley.</p><p> To begin with the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were not very early risers--thesun would be shooting his golden spikes above the Happarmountain, ere I threw aside my tappa robe, and girding my longtunic about my waist, sallied out with Fayaway and Kory-Kory, andthe rest of the household, and bent my steps towards the stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we found congregated all those who dwelt in our section ofthe valley; and here we bathed with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresh morning airand the cool flowing waters put both soul and body in a glow, andafter a half-hour employed in this recreation, we sauntered backto the house--Tinor and Marheyo gathering dry sticks by the wayfor fire-wood; some of the young men laying the cocoanut treesunder contribution as they passed beneath them; while Kory-Koryplayed his outlandish pranks for my particular diversion, andFayaway and I, not arm in arm to be sure, but sometimes hand inhand, strolled along, with feelings of perfect charity for allthe world, and especial good-will towards each other.</p><p> Our morning meal was soon prepared.&nbsp;&nbsp;The islanders are somewhatabstemious at this repast; reserving the more powerful efforts oftheir appetite to a later period of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;For my own part,with the assistance of my valet, who, as I have before stated,always officiated as spoon on these occasions, I ate sparinglyfrom one of Tinor's trenchers, of poee-poee; which was devotedexclusively for my own use, being mixed with the milky meat ofripe cocoanut.&nbsp;&nbsp;A section of a roasted bread-fruit, a small cakeof 'Amar', or a mess of 'Cokoo,' two or three bananas, or amammee-apple; an annuee, or some other agreeable and nutritiousfruit served from day to day to diversify the meal, which wasfinished by tossing off the liquid contents of a young cocoanutor two.</p><p> While partaking of this simple repast, the inmates of Marheyo'shouse, after the style of the ancient Romans, reclined insociable groups upon the divan of mats, and digestion waspromoted by cheerful conversation.</p><p> After the morning meal was concluded, pipes were lighted; andamong them my own especial pipe, a present from the noble Mehevi.</p><p> The islanders, who only smoke a whiff or two at a time, and atlong intervals, and who keep their pipes going from hand to handcontinually, regarded my systematic smoking of four or fivepipefuls of tobacco in succession, as something quite wonderful.&nbsp;&nbsp;When two or three pipes had circulated freely, the companygradually broke up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marheyo went to the little hut he wasforever building.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinor began to inspect her rolls of tappa, oremployed her busy fingers in plaiting grass-mats.&nbsp;&nbsp;The girlsanointed themselves with their fragrant oils, dressed their hair,or looked over their curious finery, and compared together theirivory trinkets, fashioned out of boar's tusks or whale's teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The young men and warriors produced their spears, paddles,canoe-gear, battle-clubs, and war-conchs, and occupied themselvesin carving, all sorts of figures upon them with pointed bits ofshell or flint, and adorning them, especially the war-conchs,with tassels of braided bark and tufts of human hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some,immediately after eating, threw themselves once more upon theinviting mats, and resumed the employment of the previous night,sleeping as soundly as if they had not closed their eyes for aweek.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others sallied out into the groves, for the purpose ofgathering fruit or fibres of bark and leaves; the last two beingin constant requisition, and applied to a hundred uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few,perhaps, among the girls, would slip into the woods afterflowers, or repair to the stream will; small calabashes andcocoanut shells, in order to polish them by friction with asmooth stone in the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth these innocent people seemedto be at no loss for something to occupy their time; and it wouldbe no light task to enumerate all their employments, or ratherpleasures.</p><p> My own mornings I spent in a variety of ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Irambled about from house to house, sure of receiving a cordialwelcome wherever I went; or from grove to grove, and from oneshady place to another, in company with Kory-Kory and Fayaway,and a rabble rout of merry young idlers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I was tooindolent for exercise, and accepting one of the many invitationsI was continually receiving, stretched myself out on the mats ofsome hospitable dwelling, and occupied myself pleasantly eitherin watching the proceedings of those around me or taking part inthem myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I chose to do the latter, the delight ofthe islanders was boundless; and there was always a throng ofcompetitors for the honour of instructing me in any particularcraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;I soon became quite an accomplished hand at makingtappa--could braid a grass sling as well as the best of them--andonce, with my knife, carved the handle of a javelin soexquisitely, that I have no doubt, to this day, Karnoonoo, itsowner, preserves it as a surprising specimen of my skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asnoon approached, all those who had wandered forth from ourhabitation, began to return; and when midday was fairly comescarcely a sound was to be heard in the valley: a deep sleep fellupon all.&nbsp;&nbsp;The luxurious siesta was hardly ever omitted, exceptby old Marheyo, who was so eccentric a character, that he seemedto be governed by no fixed principles whatever; but acting justaccording to the humour of the moment, slept, eat, or tinkeredaway at his little hut, without regard to the proprieties of timeor place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequently he might have been seen taking a nap in thesun at noon-day, or a bath in the stream of mid-night.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once Ibeheld him perched eighty feet from the ground, in the tuft of acocoanut tree, smoking; and often I saw him standing up to thewaist in water, engaged in plucking out the stray hairs of hisbeard, using a piece of muscle-shell for tweezers.</p><p> The noon-tide slumber lasted generally an hour and a half: veryoften longer; and after the sleepers had arisen from their matsthey again had recourse to their pipes, and then madepreparations for the most important meal of the day.</p><p> I, however, like those gentlemen of leisure who breakfast at homeand dine at their club, almost invariably, during my intervals ofhealth, enjoyed the afternoon repast with the bachelor chiefs ofthe Ti, who were always rejoiced to see me, and lavishly spreadbefore me all the good things which their larder afforded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mehevi generally introduced among other dainties a baked pig, anarticle which I have every reason to suppose was provided for mysole gratification.</p><p> The Ti was a right jovial place.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did my heart, as well as mybody, good to visit it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secure from female intrusion, there wasno restraint upon the hilarity of the warriors, who, like thegentlemen of Europe after the cloth is drawn and the ladiesretire, freely indulged their mirth.</p><p> After spending a considerable portion of the afternoon at the Ti,I usually found myself, as the cool of the evening came on,either sailing on the little lake with Fayaway, or bathing in thewaters of the stream with a number of the savages, who, at thishour, always repaired thither.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the shadows of nightapproached Marheyo's household were once more assembled under hisroof: tapers were lit, long curious chants were raised,interminable stories were told (for which one present was littlethe wiser), and all sorts of social festivities served to whileaway the time.</p><p> The young girls very often danced by moonlight in front of theirdwellings.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a great variety of these dances, in which,however, I never saw the men take part.&nbsp;&nbsp;They all consist ofactive, romping, mischievous evolutions, in which every limb isbrought into requisition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Marquesan girls dance allover, as it were; not only do their feet dance, but their arms,hands, fingers, ay, their very eyes, seem to dance in theirheads.</p><p> The damsels wear nothing but flowers and their compendious galatunics; and when they plume themselves for the dance, they looklike a band of olive-coloured Sylphides on the point of takingwing.&nbsp;&nbsp;In good sooth, they so sway their floating forms, archtheir necks, toss aloft their naked arms, and glide, and swim,and whirl, that it was almost too much for a quiet, sober-minded,modest young man like myself.</p><p> Unless some particular festivity was going forward, the inmatesof Marheyo's house retired to their mats rather early in theevening; but not for the night, since, after slumbering lightlyfor a while, they rose again, relit their tapers, partook of thethird and last meal of the day, at which poee-poee alone waseaten, and then, after inhaling a narcotic whiff from a pipe oftobacco, disposed themselves for the great business of night,sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Marquesans it might almost most be styled thegreat business of life, for they pass a large portion of theirtime in the arms of Somnus.&nbsp;&nbsp;The native strength of theirconstitution is no way shown more emphatically than in thequantity of sleep they can endure.&nbsp;&nbsp;To many of them, indeed, lifeis little else than an often interrupted and luxurious nap.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twenty-one</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p> THE SPRING OF ARVA WAI--REMARKABLE MONUMENTAL REMAINS--SOME IDEASWITH REGARD TO THE HISTORY OF THE PI-PIS FOUND IN THE VALLEY</p><p> ALMOST every country has its medicinal springs famed for theirhealing virtues.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cheltenham of Typee is embosomed in thedeepest solitude, and but seldom receives a visitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;It issituated remote from any dwelling, a little way up the mountain,near the head of the valley; and you approach it by a pathwayshaded by the most beautiful foliage, and adorned with a thousandfragrant plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mineral waters of Arva Wai* ooze forth fromthe crevices of a rock, and gliding down its mossy side, fall atlast, in many clustering drops, into a natural basin of stonefringed round with grass and dewy-looking little violet-colouredflowers, as fresh and beautiful as the perpetual moisture theyenjoy can make them.</p><p> *I presume this might be translated into 'Strong Waters'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arvais the name bestowed upon a root the properties of which are bothinebriating and medicinal.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Wai' is the Marquesan word forwater.</p><p> </p><p> The water is held in high estimation by the islanders, some ofwhom consider it an agreeable as well as a medicinal beverage;they bring it from the mountain in their calabashes, and store itaway beneath heaps of leaves in some shady nook near the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Marheyo had a great love for the waters of the spring.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everynow and then he lugged off to the mountain a great round demijohnof a calabash, and, panting with his exertions, brought it backfilled with his darling fluid.</p><p> The water tasted like a solution of a dozen disagreeable things,and was sufficiently nauseous to have made the fortune of theproprietor, had the spa been situated in the midst of anycivilized community.</p><p> As I am no chemist, I cannot give a scientific analysis of thewater.&nbsp;&nbsp;All I know about the matter is, that one day Marheyo inmy presence poured out the last drop from his huge calabash, andI observed at the bottom of the vessel a small quantity ofgravelly sediment very much resembling our common sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whetherthis is always found in the water, and gives it its peculiarflavour and virtues, or whether its presence was merelyincidental, I was not able to ascertain.</p><p> One day in returning from this spring by a circuitous path, Icame upon a scene which reminded me of Stonehenge and thearchitectural labours of the Druids.</p><p> At the base of one of the mountains, and surrounded on all sidesby dense groves, a series of vast terraces of stone rises, stepby step, for a considerable distance up the hill side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theseterraces cannot be less than one hundred yards in length andtwenty in width.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their magnitude, however, is less striking thanthe immense size of the blocks composing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of thestones, of an oblong shape, are from ten to fifteen feet inlength, and five or six feet thick.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sides are quitesmooth, but though square, and of pretty regular formation, theybear no mark of the chisel.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are laid together withoutcement, and here and there show gaps between.&nbsp;&nbsp;The topmostterrace and the lower one are somewhat peculiar in theirconstruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have both a quadrangular depression in thecentre, leaving the rest of the terrace elevated several feetabove it.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the intervals of the stones immense trees havetaken root, and their broad boughs stretching far over, andinterlacing together, support a canopy almost impenetrable to thesun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overgrowing the greater part of them, and climbing from oneto another, is a wilderness of vines, in whose sinewy embracemany of the stones lie half-hidden, while in some places a thickgrowth of bushes entirely covers them.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wild pathwaywhich obliquely crosses two of these terraces; and so profound isthe shade, so dense the vegetation, that a stranger to the placemight pass along it without being aware of their existence.</p><p> These structures bear every indication of a very high antiquityand Kory-Kory, who was my authority in all matters of scientificresearch, gave me to understand that they were coeval with thecreation of the world; that the great gods themselves were thebuilders; and that they would endure until time shall be no more.</p><p> Kory-Kory's prompt explanation and his attributing the work to adivine origin, at once convinced me that neither he nor the restof his country-men knew anything about them.</p><p> As I gazed upon this monument, doubtless the work of an extinctand forgotten race, thus buried in the green nook of an island atthe ends of the earth, the existence of which was yesterdayunknown, a stronger feeling of awe came over me than if I hadstood musing at the mighty base of the Pyramid of Cheops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereare no inscriptions, no sculpture, no clue, by which toconjecture its history; nothing but the dumb stones.&nbsp;&nbsp;How manygenerations of the majestic trees which overshadow them havegrown and flourished and decayed since first they were erected!</p><p> These remains naturally suggest many interesting reflections.&nbsp;&nbsp;They establish the great age of the island, an opinion which thebuilders of theories concerning, the creation of the variousgroups in the South Seas are not always inclined to admit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Formy own part, I think it just as probable that human beings wereliving in the valleys of the Marquesas three thousand years agoas that they were inhabiting the land of Egypt.&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin ofthe island of Nukuheva cannot be imputed to the coral insect; forindefatigable as that wonderful creature is, it would be hardlymuscular enough to pile rocks one upon the other more than threethousand feet above the level of the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;That the land may havebeen thrown up by a submarine volcano is as possible as anythingelse.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can make an affidavit to the contrary, andtherefore I still say nothing against the supposition: indeed,were geologists to assert that the whole continent of America hadin like manner been formed by the simultaneous explosion of atrain of Etnas laid under the water all the way from the NorthPole to the parallel of Cape Horn, I am the last man in the worldto contradict them.</p><p> I have already mentioned that the dwellings of the islanders werealmost invariably built upon massive stone foundations, whichthey call pi-pis.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dimensions of these, however, as well asof the stones composing them, are comparatively small: but thereare other and larger erections of a similar descriptioncomprising the 'morais', or burying grounds, and festival-places,in nearly all the valleys of the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these piles areso extensive, and so great a degree of labour and skill must havebeen requisite in constructing them, that I can scarcely believethey were built by the ancestors of the present inhabitants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ifindeed they were, the race has sadly deteriorated in theirknowledge of the mechanic arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;To say nothing of their habitualindolence, by what contrivance within the reach of so simple apeople could such enormous masses have been moved or fixed intheir places?&nbsp;&nbsp;and how could they with their rude implements havechiselled and hammered them into shape?</p><p> All of these larger pi-pis--like that of the Hoolah Hoolah groundin the Typee valley--bore incontestible marks of great age; and Iam disposed to believe that their erection may be ascribed to thesame race of men who were the builders of the still more ancientremains I have just described.</p><p> According to Kory-Kory's account, the pi-pi upon which stands theHoolah Hoolah ground was built a great many moons ago, under thedirection of Monoo, a great chief and warrior, and, as it wouldappear, master-mason among the Typees.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was erected for theexpress purpose to which it is at present devoted, in theincredibly short period of one sun; and was dedicated to theimmortal wooden idols by a grand festival, which lasted ten daysand nights.</p><p> Among the smaller pi-pis, upon which stand the dwelling-houses ofthe natives, I never observed any which intimated a recenterection.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are in every part of the valley a great many ofthese massive stone foundations which have no houses upon them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is vastly convenient, for whenever an enterprising islanderchooses to emigrate a few hundred yards from the place where hewas born, all he has to do in order to establish himself in somenew locality, is to select one of.&nbsp;&nbsp;the many unappropriatedpi-pis, and without further ceremony pitch his bamboo tent uponit.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twenty-two</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p> PREPARATIONS FOR A GRAND FESTIVAL IN THE VALLEY--STRANGE DOINGSIN THE TABOO GROVES--MONUMENT OF CALABASHES--GALA COSTUME OF THETYPEE DAMSELS--DEPARTURE FOR THE FESTIVAL</p><p> FROM the time that my lameness had decreased I had made a dailypractice of visiting Mehevi at the Ti, who invariably gave me amost cordial reception.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was always accompanied in theseexcursions by Fayaway and the ever-present Kory- Kory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theformer, as soon as we reached the vicinity of the Ti--which wasrigorously tabooed to the whole female sex--withdrew to aneighbouring hut, as if her feminine delicacy 'restricted' herfrom approaching a habitation which might be regarded as a sortof Bachelor's Hall.</p><p> And in good truth it might well have been so considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was the permanent residence of several distinguishedchiefs, and of the noble Mehevi in particular, it was still atcertain seasons the favourite haunt of all the jolly, talkative,and elderly savages of the vale, who resorted thither in the sameway that similar characters frequent a tavern in civilizedcountries.&nbsp;&nbsp;There they would remain hour after hour, chatting,smoking, eating poee-poee, or busily engaged in sleeping for thegood of their constitutions.</p><p> This building appeared to be the head-quarters of the valley,where all flying rumours concentrated; and to have seen it filledwith a crowd of the natives, all males, conversing in animatedclusters, while multitudes were continually coming and going, onewould have thought it a kind of savage Exchange, where the riseand fall of Polynesian Stock was discussed.</p><p> Mehevi acted as supreme lord over the place, spending the greaterportion of his time there: and often when, at particular hours ofthe day, it was deserted by nearly every one else except theverd-antique looking centenarians, who were fixtures in thebuilding, the chief himself was sure to be found enjoying his'otium cum dignitate'--upon the luxurious mats which covered thefloor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I made my appearance he invariably rose, andlike a gentleman doing the honours of his mansion, invited me torepose myself wherever I pleased, and calling out 'tamaree!'(boy), a little fellow would appear, and then retiring for aninstant, return with some savoury mess, from which the chiefwould press me to regale myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the truth, Mehevi wasindebted to the excellence of his viands for the honour of myrepeated visits--a matter which cannot appear singular, when itis borne in mind that bachelors, all the world over, are famousfor serving up unexceptionable repasts.</p><p> One day, on drawing near to the Ti, I observed that extensivepreparations were going forward, plainly betokening someapproaching festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the symptoms reminded me of thestir produced among the scullions of a large hotel, where a grandjubilee dinner is about to be given.&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives were hurryingabout hither and thither, engaged in various duties, some luggingoff to the stream enormous hollow bamboos, for the purpose offilling them with water; others chasing furious-looking hogsthrough the bushes, in their endeavours to capture them; andnumbers employed in kneading great mountains of poee-poee heapedup in huge wooden vessels.</p><p> After observing these lively indications for a while, I wasattracted to a neighbouring grove by a prodigious squeaking whichI heard there.&nbsp;&nbsp;On reaching the spot I found it proceeded from alarge hog which a number of natives were forcibly holding to theearth, while a muscular fellow, armed with a bludgeon, wasineffectually aiming murderous blows at the skull of theunfortunate porker.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again and again he missed his writhing andstruggling victim, but though puffing and panting with hisexertions, he still continued them; and after striking asufficient number of blows to have demolished an entire drove ofoxen, with one crashing stroke he laid him dead at his feet.</p><p> Without letting any blood from the body, it was immediatelycarried to a fire which had been kindled near at hand and foursavages taking hold of the carcass by its legs, passed it rapidlyto and fro in the flames.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment the smell of burningbristles betrayed the object of this procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having got thusfar in the matter, the body was removed to a little distance and,being disembowelled, the entrails were laid aside as choiceparts, and the whole carcass thoroughly washed with water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anample thick green cloth, composed of the long thick leaves of aspecies of palm-tree, ingeniously tacked together with littlepins of bamboo, was now spread upon the ground, in which the bodybeing carefully rolled, it was borne to an oven previouslyprepared to receive it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it was at once laid upon the heatedstones at the bottom, and covered with thick layers of leaves,the whole being quickly hidden from sight by a mound of earthraised over it.</p><p> Such is the summary style in which the Typees convertperverse-minded and rebellious hogs into the most docile andamiable pork; a morsel of which placed on the tongue melts like asoft smile from the lips of Beauty.</p><p> I commend then peculiar mode of proceeding to the considerationof all butchers, cooks, and housewives.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hapless porker whosefate I have just rehearsed, was not the only one who suffered inthat memorable day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a dismal grunt, many an imploringsqueak, proclaimed what was going on throughout the whole extentof the valley; and I verily believe the first-born of everylitter perished before the setting of that fatal sun.</p><p> The scene around the Ti was now most animated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hogs andpoee-poee were baking in numerous ovens, which, heaped up withfresh earth into slight elevations, looked like so manyant-hills.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scores of the savages were vigorously plying theirstone pestles in preparing masses of poee-poee, and numbers weregathering green bread-fruit and young cocoanuts in thesurrounding groves; when an exceeding great multitude, with aview of encouraging the rest in their labours, stood still, andkept shouting most lustily without intermission.</p><p> It is a peculiarity among these people, that, when engaged in anemployment, they always make a prodigious fuss about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soseldom do they ever exert themselves, that when they do work theyseem determined that so meritorious an action shall not escapethe observation of those around if, for example, they haveoccasion to remove a stone to a little distance, which perhapsmight be carried by two able-bodied men, a whole swarm gatherabout it, and, after a vast deal of palavering, lift it up amongthem, every one struggling to get hold of it, and bear it offyelling and panting as if accomplishing some mighty achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing them on these occasions, one is reminded of an infinity ofblack ants clustering about and dragging away to some hole theleg of a deceased fly.</p><p> Having for some time attentively observed these demonstrations ofgood cheer, I entered the Ti, where Mehevi sat complacentlylooking out upon the busy scene, and occasionally issuing hisorders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief appeared to be in an extraordinary flow ofspirits and gave me to understand that on the morrow there wouldbe grand doings in the Groves generally, and at the Ti inparticular; and urged me by no means to absent myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incommemoration of what event, however, or in honour of whatdistinguished personage, the feast was to be given, altogetherpassed my comprehension.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mehevi sought to enlighten myignorance, but he failed as signally as when he had endeavouredto initiate me into the perplexing arcana of the taboo.</p><p> On leaving the Ti, Kory-Kory, who had as a matter of courseaccompanied me, observing that my curiosity remained unabated,resolved to make everything plain and satisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp;With thisintent, he escorted me through the Taboo Groves, pointing out tomy notice a variety of objects, and endeavoured to explain themin such an indescribable jargon of words, that it almost put mein bodily pain to listen to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, he led me to aremarkable pyramidical structure some three yards square at thebase, and perhaps ten feet in height, which had lately beenthrown up, and occupied a very conspicuous position.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wascomposed principally of large empty calabashes, with a fewpolished cocoanut shells, and looked not unlike a cenotaph ofskulls.&nbsp;&nbsp;My cicerone perceived the astonishment with which Igazed at this monument of savage crockery, and immediatelyaddressed himself in the task of enlightening me: but all invain; and to this hour the nature of the monument remains acomplete mystery to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;As, however, it formed so prominent afeature in the approaching revels, I bestowed upon the latter, inmy own mind, the title of the 'Feast of Calabashes'.</p><p> The following morning, awaking rather late, I perceived the wholeof Marheyo's family busily engaged in preparing for the festival.</p><p> The old warrior himself was arranging in round balls the two greylocks of hair that were suffered to grow from the crown of hishead; his earrings and spear, both well polished, lay beside him,while the highly decorative pair of shoes hung suspended from aprojecting cane against the side of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;The young menwere similarly employed; and the fair damsels, including Fayaway,were anointing themselves with 'aka', arranging their longtresses, and performing other matters connected with the dutiesof the toilet.</p><p> Having completed their preparations, the girls now exhibitedthemselves in gala costume; the most conspicuous feature of whichwas a necklace of beautiful white flowers, with the stemsremoved, and strung closely together upon a single fibre oftappa.&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding ornaments were inserted in their ears, andwoven garlands upon their heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;About their waist they wore ashort tunic of spotless white tappa, and some of them super-addedto this a mantle of the same material, tied in an elaborate bowupon the left shoulder, and falling about the figure inpicturesque folds.</p><p> Thus arrayed, I would have matched the charming Fayaway againstany beauty in the world.</p><p> People may say what they will about the taste evinced by ourfashionable ladies in dress.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their jewels, their feathers, theirsilks, and their furbelows, would have sunk into utterinsignificance beside the exquisite simplicity of attire adoptedby the nymphs of the vale on this festive occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shouldlike to have seen a gallery of coronation beauties, atWestminster Abbey, confronted for a moment by this band of islandgirls; their stiffness, formality, and affectation, contrastedwith the artless vivacity and unconcealed natural graces of thesesavage maidens.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be the Venus de' Medici placed beside amilliner's doll.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not long before Kory-Kory and myselfwere left alone in the house, the rest of its inmates havingdeparted for the Taboo Groves.&nbsp;&nbsp;My valet was all impatience tofollow them; and was as fidgety about my dilatory movements as adiner out waiting hat in hand at the bottom of the stairs forsome lagging companion.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, yielding to his importunities,I set out for the Ti.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we passed the houses peeping out fromthe groves through which our route lay, I noticed that they wereentirely deserted by their inhabitants.</p><p> When we reached the rock that abruptly terminated the path, andconcealed from us the festive scene, wild shouts and a confusedblending of voices assured me that the occasion, whatever itmight be, had drawn together a great multitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kory-Kory,previous to mounting the elevation, paused for a moment, like adandy at a ball-room door, to put a hasty finish to his toilet.&nbsp;&nbsp;During this short interval, the thought struck me that I oughtmyself perhaps to be taking some little pains with my appearance.</p><p> But as I had no holiday raiment, I was not a little puzzled todevise some means of decorating myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I feltdesirous to create a sensation, I determined to do all that layin my power; and knowing that I could not delight the savagesmore than by conforming to their style of dress, I removed frommy person the large robe of tappa which I was accustomed to wearover my shoulders whenever I sallied into the open air, andremained merely girt about with a short tunic descending from mywaist to my knees.</p><p> My quick-witted attendant fully appreciated the compliment I waspaying to the costume of his race, and began more sedulously toarrange the folds of the one only garment which remained to me.Whilst he was doing this,I caught sight of a knot of younglasses, who were sitting near us on the grass surrounded by heapsof flowers which they were forming into garlands.&nbsp;&nbsp;I motioned tothem to bring some of their handywork to me; and in an instant adozen wreaths were at my disposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them I put round theapology for a hat which I had been forced to construct for myselfout of palmetto-leaves, and some of the others I converted into asplendid girdle.&nbsp;&nbsp;These operations finished, with the slow anddignified step of a full-dressed beau I ascended the rock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twenty-three</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p> THE FEAST OF CALABASHES</p><p> THE whole population of the valley seemed to be gathered withinthe precincts of the grove.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance could be seen thelong front of the Ti, its immense piazza swarming with men,arrayed in every variety of fantastic costume, and allvociferating with animated gestures; while the whole intervalbetween it and the place where I stood was enlivened by groups offemales fancifully decorated, dancing, capering, and utteringwild exclamations.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they descried me they set up ashout of welcome; and a band of them came dancing towards me,chanting as they approached some wild recitative.&nbsp;&nbsp;The change inmy garb seemed to transport them with delight, and clusteringabout me on all sides, they accompanied me towards the Ti.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenhowever we drew near it these joyous nymphs paused in theircareer, and parting on either side, permitted me to pass on tothe now densely thronged building.</p><p> So soon as I mounted to the pi-pi I saw at a glance that therevels were fairly under way.</p><p> What lavish plenty reigned around?--Warwick feasting hisretainers with beef and ale, was a niggard to the nobleMehevi!--All along the piazza of the Ti were arranged elaboratelycarved canoe-shaped vessels, some twenty feet in length, tiedwith newly made poee-poee, and sheltered from the sun by thebroad leaves of the banana.&nbsp;&nbsp;At intervals were heaps of greenbread-fruit, raised in pyramidical stacks, resembling the regularpiles of heavy shot to be seen in the yard of an arsenal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inserted into the interstices of the huge stones which formed thepi-pi were large boughs of trees; hanging from the branches ofwhich, and screened from the sun by their foliage, wereinnumerable little packages with leafy coverings, containing themeat of the numerous hogs which had been slain, done up in thismanner to make it more accessible to the crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning againstthe railing on the piazza were an immense number of long, heavybamboos, plugged at the lower end, and with their projectingmuzzles stuffed with a wad of leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were filled withwater from the stream, and each of them might hold from four tofive gallons.</p><p> The banquet being thus spread, naught remained but for everyoneto help himself at his pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly not a moment passedbut the transplanted boughs I have mentioned were rifled by thethrong of the fruit they certainly had never borne before.&nbsp;&nbsp;Calabashes of poee-poee were continually being replenished fromthe extensive receptacle in which that article was stored, andmultitudes of little fires were kindled about the Ti for thepurpose of roasting the bread-fruit.</p><p> Within the building itself was presented a most extraordinaryscene.&nbsp;&nbsp;The immense lounge of mats lying between the parallelrows of the trunks of cocoanut trees, and extending the entirelength of the house, at least two hundred feet, was covered bythe reclining forms of a host of chiefs and warriors who wereeating at a great rate, or soothing the cares of Polynesian lifein the sedative fumes of tobacco.&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke was inhaled fromlarge pipes, the bowls of which, made out of small cocoanutshells, were curiously carved in strange heathenish devices. These were passed from mouth to mouth by the recumbent smokers,each of whom, taking two or three prodigious whiffs, handed thepipe to his neighbour; sometimes for that purpose stretchingindolently across the body of some dozing individual whoseexertions at the dinner-table had already induced sleep.</p><p> The tobacco used among the Typees was of a very mild and pleasingflavour, and as I always saw it in leaves, and the nativesappeared pretty well supplied with it, I was led to believe thatit must have been the growth of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed Kory-Korygave me to understand that this was the case; but I never saw asingle plant growing on the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;At Nukuheva, and, I believe,in all the other valleys, the weed is very scarce, being onlyobtained in small quantities from foreigners, and smoking isconsequently with the inhabitants of these places a very greatluxury.&nbsp;&nbsp;How it was that the Typees were so well furnished withit I cannot divine.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should think them too indolent to devoteany attention to its culture; and, indeed, as far as myobservation extended, not a single atom of the soil was under anyother cultivation than that of shower and sunshine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thetobacco-plant, however, like the sugar-cane, may grow wild insome remote part of the vale.</p><p> There were many in the Ti for whom the tobacco did not furnish asufficient stimulus, and who accordingly had recourse to 'arva',as a more powerful agent in producing the desired effect.</p><p> 'Arva' is a root very generally dispersed over the South Seas,and from it is extracted a juice, the effects of which upon thesystem are at first stimulating in a moderate degree; but it soonrelaxes the muscles, and exerting a narcotic influence produces aluxurious sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley this beverage was universallyprepared in the following way:--Some half-dozen young boys seatedthemselves in a circle around an empty wooden vessel, each one ofthem being supplied with a certain quantity of the roots of the'arva', broken into small bits and laid by his side.&nbsp;&nbsp;A cocoanutgoblet of water was passed around the juvenile company, whorinsing their mouths with its contents, proceeded to the businessbefore them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This merely consisted in thoroughly masticating the'arva', and throwing it mouthful after mouthful into thereceptacle provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a sufficient quantity had been thusobtained water was poured upon the mass, and being stirred aboutwith the forefinger of the right hand, the preparation was soonin readiness for use.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'arva' has medicinal qualities.</p><p> Upon the Sandwich Islands it has been employed with no smallsuccess in the treatment of scrofulous affections, and incombating the ravages of a disease for whose frightful inroadsthe ill-starred inhabitants of that group are indebted to theirforeign benefactors.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the tenants of the Typee valley, as yetexempt from these inflictions, generally employ the 'arva' as aminister to social enjoyment, and a calabash of the liquidcirculates among them as the bottle with us.</p><p> Mehevi, who was greatly delighted with the change in my costume,gave me a cordial welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had reserved for me a mostdelectable mess of 'cokoo', well knowing my partiality for thatdish; and had likewise selected three or four young cocoanuts,several roasted bread-fruit, and a magnificent bunch of bananas,for my especial comfort and gratification.&nbsp;&nbsp;These various matterswere at once placed before me; but Kory-Kory deemed the banquetentirely insufficient for my wants until he had supplied me withone of the leafy packages of pork, which, notwithstanding thesomewhat hasty manner in which it had been prepared, possessed amost excellent flavour, and was surprisingly sweet and tender.</p><p> Pork is not a staple article of food among the people of theMarquesas; consequently they pay little attention to the BREEDINGof the swine.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hogs are permitted to roam at large on thegroves, where they obtain no small part of their nourishment fromthe cocoanuts which continually fall from the trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it isonly after infinite labour and difficulty, that the hungry animalcan pierce the husk and shell so as to get at the meat.&nbsp;&nbsp;I havefrequently been amused at seeing one of them, after crunching theobstinate nut with his teeth for a long time unsuccessfully, getinto a violent passion with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;He would then root furiouslyunder the cocoanut, and, with a fling of his snout, toss itbefore him on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following it up, he would crunch at itagain savagely for a moment, and then next knock it on one side,pausing immediately after, as if wondering how it could sosuddenly have disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way the persecuted cocoanutswere often chased half across the valley.</p><p> The second day of the Feast of Calabashes was ushered in by stillmore uproarious noises than the first.&nbsp;&nbsp;The skins of innumerablesheep seemed to be resounding to the blows of an army ofdrummers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Startled from my slumbers by the din, I leaped up, andfound the whole household engaged in making preparations forimmediate departure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Curious to discover of what strange eventsthese novel sounds might be the precursors, and not a littledesirous to catch a sight of the instruments which produced theterrific noise, I accompanied the natives as soon as they were inreadiness to depart for the Taboo Groves.</p><p> The comparatively open space that extended from the Ti toward therock, to which I have before alluded as forming the ascent to theplace, was, with the building itself, now altogether deserted bythe men; the whole distance being filled by bands of females,shouting and dancing under the influence of some strangeexcitement.</p><p> I was amused at the appearance of four or five old women who, ina state of utter nudity, with their arms extended flatly downtheir sides, and holding themselves perfectly erect, were leapingstiffly into the air, like so many sticks bobbing to the surface,after being pressed perpendicularly into the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theypreserved the utmost gravity of countenance, and continued theirextraordinary movements without a single moment's cessation.&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not appear to attract the observation of the crowdaround them, but I must candidly confess that for my, own part, Istared at them most pertinaciously.</p><p> Desirous of being enlightened in regard to the meaning of thispeculiar diversion, I turned, inquiringly to Kory-Kory; thatlearned Typee immediately proceeded to explain the whole matterthoroughly.&nbsp;&nbsp;But all that I could comprehend from what he saidwas, that the leaping figures before me were bereaved widows,whose partners had been slain in battle many moons previously;and who, at every festival, gave public evidence in this mannerof their calamities.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was evident that Kory-Kory consideredthis an all-sufficient reason for so indecorous a custom; but Imust say that it did not satisfy me as to its propriety.</p><p> Leaving these afflicted females, we passed on to the HoolahHoolah ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the spacious quadrangle, the wholepopulation of the valley seemed to be assembled, and the sightpresented was truly remarkable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the sheds of bamboowhich opened towards the interior of the square reclined theprincipal chiefs and warriors, while a miscellaneous throng layat their ease under the enormous trees which spread a majesticcanopy overhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the terraces of the gigantic altars, ateach end, were deposited green bread-fruit in baskets of cocoanutleaves, large rolls of tappa, bunches of ripe bananas, clustersof mammee-apples, the golden-hued fruit of the artu-tree, andbaked hogs, laid out in large wooden trenchers, fancifullydecorated with freshly plucked leaves, whilst a variety of rudeimplements of war were piled in confused heaps before the ranksof hideous idols.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruits of various; kinds were likewisesuspended in leafen baskets, from the tops of poles planteduprightly, and at regular intervals, along the lower terraces ofboth altars.&nbsp;&nbsp;At their base were arranged two parallel rows ofcumbersome drums, standing at least fifteen feet in height, andformed from the hollow trunks of large trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their heads werecovered with shark skins, and their barrels were elaboratelycarved with various quaint figures and devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;At regularintervals they were bound round by a species of sinnate ofvarious colours, and strips of native cloth flattened upon themhere and there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind these instruments were built slightplatforms, upon which stood a number of young men who, beatingviolently with the palms of their hands upon the drum-heads,produced those outrageous sounds which had awakened me in themorning.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every few minutes these musical performers hopped downfrom their elevation into the crowd below, and their places wereimmediately supplied by fresh recruits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus an incessant dinwas kept up that might have startled Pandemonium.</p><p> Precisely in the middle of the quadrangle were placedperpendicularly in the ground, a hundred or more slender,fresh-cut poles, stripped of their bark, and decorated at the endwith a floating pennon of white tappa; the whole being fencedabout with a little picket of canes.&nbsp;&nbsp;For what purpose theseangular ornaments were intended I in vain endeavoured todiscover.</p><p> Another most striking feature of the performance was exhibited bya score of old men, who sat cross-legged in the little pulpits,which encircled the trunks of the immense trees growing in themiddle of the enclosure.&nbsp;&nbsp;These venerable gentlemen, who Ipresume were the priests, kept up an uninterrupted monotonouschant, which was partly drowned in the roar of drums.&nbsp;&nbsp;In theright hand they held a finely woven grass fan, with a heavy blackwooden handle curiously chased: these fans they kept in continualmotion.</p><p> But no attention whatever seemed to be paid to the drummers or tothe old priests; the individuals who composed the vast crowdpresent being entirely taken up in chanting and laughing with oneanother, smoking, drinking 'arva', and eating.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all theobservation it attracted, or the good it achieved, the wholesavage orchestra might with great advantage to its own membersand the company in general, have ceased the prodigious uproarthey were making.</p><p> In vain I questioned Kory-Kory and others of the natives, as tothe meaning of the strange things that were going on; all theirexplanations were conveyed in such a mass of outlandish gibberishand gesticulation that I gave up the attempt in despair.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allthat day the drums resounded, the priests chanted, and themultitude feasted and roared till sunset, when the throngdispersed, and the Taboo Groves were again abandoned to quiet andrepose.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day the same scene was repeated until night,when this singular festival terminated.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twenty-four</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p> IDEAS SUGGESTED BY THE FEAST OF CALABASHES--INACCURACY OF CERTAINPUBLISHED ACCOUNTS OF THE ISLANDS--A REASON--NEGLECTED STATE OFHEATHENISM IN THE VALLEY--EFFIGY OF A DEAD WARRIOR--A SINGULARSUPERSTITION--THE PRIEST KOLORY AND THE GOD MOA ARTUA--AMAZINGRELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE--A DILAPIDATED SHRINE--KORY-KORY AND THEIDOL--AN INFERENCE</p><p> ALTHOUGH I had been baffled in my attempts to learn the origin ofthe Feast of Calabashes, yet it seemed very plain to me that itwas principally, if not wholly, of a religious character.&nbsp;&nbsp;As areligious solemnity, however, it had not at all corresponded withthe horrible descriptions of Polynesian worship which we havereceived in some published narratives, and especially in thoseaccounts of the evangelized islands with which the missionarieshave favoured us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not the sacred character of these personsrender the purity of their intentions unquestionable, I shouldcertainly be led to suppose that they had exaggerated the evilsof Paganism, in order to enhance the merit of their owndisinterested labours.</p><p> In a certain work incidentally treating of the 'Washington, orNorthern Marquesas Islands,' I have seen the frequent immolationof human victims upon the altars of their gods, positively andrepeatedly charged upon the inhabitants.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same work givesalso a rather minute account of their religion--enumerates agreat many of their superstitions--and makes known the particulardesignations of numerous orders of the priesthood.&nbsp;&nbsp;One wouldalmost imagine from the long list that is given of cannibalprimates, bishops, arch-deacons, prebendaries, and other inferiorecclesiastics, that the sacerdotal order far outnumbered the restof the population, and that the poor natives were more severelypriest-ridden than even the inhabitants of the papal states.&nbsp;&nbsp;These accounts are likewise calculated to leave upon the reader'smind an impression that human victims are daily cooked and servedup upon the altars; that heathenish cruelties of everydescription are continually practised; and that these ignorantPagans are in a state of the extremest wretchedness inconsequence of the grossness of their superstitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be itobserved, however, that all this information is given by a manwho, according to his own statement, was only at one of theislands, and remained there but two weeks, sleeping every nighton board his ship, and taking little kid-glove excursions ashorein the daytime, attended by an armed party.</p><p> Now, all I can say is, that in all my excursions through thevalley of Typee, I never saw any of these alleged enormities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ifany of them are practised upon the Marquesas Islands they mustcertainly have come to my knowledge while living for months witha tribe of savages, wholly unchanged from their originalprimitive condition, and reputed the most ferocious in the SouthSeas.</p><p> The fact is, that there is a vast deal of unintentionalhumbuggery in some of the accounts we have from scientific menconcerning the religious institutions of Polynesia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theselearned tourists generally obtain the greater part of theirinformation from retired old South-Sea rovers, who havedomesticated themselves among the barbarous tribes of thePacific.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack, who has long been accustomed to the long-bow, andto spin tough yarns on the ship's forecastle, invariablyofficiates as showman of the island on which he has settled, andhaving mastered a few dozen words of the language, is supposed toknow all about the people who speak it.&nbsp;&nbsp;A natural desire to makehimself of consequence in the eyes of the strangers, prompts himto lay claim to a much greater knowledge of such matters than heactually possesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to incessant queries, hecommunicates not only all he knows but a good deal more, and ifthere be any information deficient still he is at no loss tosupply it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The avidity with which his anecdotes are noted downtickles his vanity, and his powers of invention increase with thecredulity auditors.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows just the sort of informationwanted, and furnishes it to any extent.</p><p> This is not a supposed case; I have met with several individualslike the one described, and I have been present at two or threeof their interviews with strangers.</p><p> Now, when the scientific voyager arrives at home with hiscollection of wonders, he attempts, perhaps, to give adescription of some of,the strange people he has been visiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of representing them as a community of lusty savages, whoare leading a merry, idle, innocent life, he enters into a verycircumstantial and learned narrative of certain unaccountablesuperstitions and practices, about which he knows as little asthe islanders themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having had little time, and scarcelyany opportunity, to become acquainted with the customs hepretends to describe, he writes them down one after another in anoff-hand, haphazard style; and were the book thus produced to betranslated into the tongue of the people of whom it purports togive the history, it would appear quite as wonderful to them asit does to the American public, and much more improbable.</p><p> For my own part, I am free to confess my almost entire inabilityto gratify any curiosity that may be felt with regard to thetheology of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt whether the inhabitantsthemselves could do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are either too lazy or too sensibleto worry themselves about abstract points of religious belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was among them, they never held any synods or councils tosettle the principles of their faith by agitating them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anunbounded liberty of conscience seemed to prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those whopleased to do so were allowed to repose implicit faith in anill-favoured god with a large bottle-nose and fat shapeless armscrossed upon his breast; whilst others worshipped an image which,having no likeness either in heaven or on earth, could hardly becalled an idol.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the islanders always maintained a discreetreserve with regard to my own peculiar views on religion, Ithought it would be excessively ill-bred of me to pry intotheirs.</p><p> But, although my knowledge of the religious faith of the Typeeswas unavoidably limited, one of their superstitious observanceswith which I became acquainted interested me greatly.</p><p> In one of the most secluded portions of the valley within astone's cast of Fayaway's lake--for so I christened the scene ofour island yachting--and hard by a growth of palms, which stoodranged in order along both banks of the stream, waving theirgreen arms as if to do honour to its passage, was the mausoleumof a deceased, warrior chief.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all the other edifices of anynote, it was raised upon a small pi-pi of stones, which, being ofunusual height, was a conspicuous object from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alight thatching of bleached palmetto-leaves hung over it like aself supported canopy; for it was not until you came very nearthat you saw it was supported by four slender columns of bamboorising at each corner to a little more than the height of a man.&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear area of a few yards surrounded the pi-pi, and wasenclosed by four trunks of cocoanut trees resting at the angleson massive blocks of stone.&nbsp;&nbsp;The place was sacred.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sign ofthe inscrutable Taboo was seen in the shape of a mystic roll ofwhite tappa, suspended by a twisted cord of the same materialfrom the top of a slight pole planted within the enclosure*.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thesanctity of the spot appeared never to have been violated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thestillness of the grave was there, and the calm solitude aroundwas beautiful and touching.&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft shadows of those loftypalm-trees!--I can see them now--hanging over the little temple,as if to keep out the intrusive sun.</p><p> *White appears to be the sacred colour among the Marquesans.</p><p> On all sides as you approached this silent spot you caught sightof the dead chief's effigy, seated in the stern of a canoe, whichwas raised on a light frame a few inches above the level of thepi-pi.&nbsp;&nbsp;The canoe was about seven feet in length; of a rich, darkcoloured wood, handsomely carved and adorned in many places withvariegated bindings of stained sinnate, into which wereingeniously wrought a number of sparkling seashells, and a beltof the same shells ran all round it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the figure--ofwhatever material it might have been made--was effectuallyconcealed in a heavy robe of brown tappa, revealing; only thehands and head; the latter skilfully carved in wood, andsurmounted by a superb arch of plumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;These plumes, in thesubdued and gentle gales which found access to this sequesteredspot, were never for one moment at rest, but kept nodding andwaving over the chief's brow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The long leaves of the palmettodrooped over the eaves, and through them you saw the warriorholding his paddle with both hands in the act of rowing, leaningforward and inclining his head, as if eager to hurry on hisvoyage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Glaring at him forever, and face to face, was a polishedhuman skull, which crowned the prow of the canoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectralfigurehead, reversed in its position, glancing backwards, seemedto mock the impatient attitude of the warrior.</p><p> When I first visited this singular place with Kory-Kory, he toldme--or at least I so understood him--that the chief was paddlinghis way to the realms of bliss, and bread-fruit--the Polynesianheaven--where every moment the bread-fruit trees dropped theirripened spheres to the ground, and where there was no end to thecocoanuts and bananas: there they reposed through the livelongeternity upon mats much finer than those of Typee; and every daybathed their glowing limbs in rivers of cocoanut oil.&nbsp;&nbsp;In thathappy land there were plenty of plumes and feathers, andboars'-tusks and sperm-whale teeth, far preferable to all theshining trinkets and gay tappa of the white men; and, best ofall, women far lovelier than the daughters of earth were there inabundance.&nbsp;&nbsp;'A very pleasant place,' Kory-Kory said it was; 'butafter all, not much pleasanter, he thought, than Typee.'&nbsp;&nbsp;'Did henot then,' I asked him, 'wish to accompany the warrior?'&nbsp;&nbsp;'Oh no:he was very happy where he was; but supposed that some time orother he would go in his own canoe.'</p><p> Thus far, I think, I clearly comprehended Kory-Kory.&nbsp;&nbsp;But therewas a singular expression he made use of at the time, enforced byas singular a gesture, the meaning of which I would have givenmuch to penetrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am inclined to believe it must have been aproverb he uttered; for I afterwards heard him repeat the samewords several times, and in what appeared to me to be a somewhat:similar sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Kory-Kory had a great variety of short,smart-sounding sentences, with which he frequently enlivened hisdiscourse; and he introduced them with an air which plainlyintimated, that in his opinion, they settled the matter inquestion, whatever it might be.</p><p> Could it have been then, that when I asked him whether he desiredto go to this heaven of bread-fruit, cocoanuts, and young ladies,which he had been describing, he answered by saying somethingequivalent to our old adage--'A bird in the hand is worth two inthe bush'?--if he did, Kory-Kory was a discreet and sensiblefellow, and I cannot sufficiently admire his shrewdness.</p><p> Whenever, in the course of my rambles through the valley Ihappened to be near the chief's mausoleum, I always turned asideto visit it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The place had a peculiar charm for me; I hardlyknow why, but so it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I leaned over the railing and gazedupon the strange effigy and watched the play of the featheryhead-dress, stirred by the same breeze which in low tonesbreathed amidst the lofty palm-trees, I loved to yield myself upto the fanciful superstition of the islanders, and could almostbelieve that the grim warrior was bound heavenward.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moodwhen I turned to depart, I bade him 'God speed, and a pleasantvoyage.'&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, paddle away, brave chieftain, to the land ofspirits!&nbsp;&nbsp;To the material eye thou makest but little progress;but with the eye of faith, I see thy canoe cleaving the brightwaves, which die away on those dimly looming shores of Paradise.</p><p> This strange superstition affords another evidence of the fact,that however ignorant man may be, he still feels within him hisimmortal spirit yearning, after the unknown future.</p><p> Although the religious theories of the islands were a completemystery to me, their practical every-day operation could not beconcealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I frequently passed the little temples reposing inthe shadows of the taboo groves and beheld the offerings--mouldyfruit spread out upon a rude altar, or hanging in half-decayedbaskets around some uncouth jolly-looking image; I was presentduring the continuance of the festival; I daily beheld thegrinning idols marshalled rank and file in the Hoolah Hoolahground, and was often in the habit of meeting those whom Isupposed to be the priests.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the temples seemed to beabandoned to solitude; the festival had been nothing more than ajovial mingling of the tribe; the idols were quite harmless asany other logs of wood; and the priests were the mightiest dogsin the valley.</p><p> In fact religious affairs in Typee were at a very low ebb: allsuch matters sat very lightly upon the thoughtless inhabitants;and, in the celebration of many of their strange rites, theyappeared merely to seek a sort of childish amusement.</p><p> A curious evidence of this was given in a remarkable ceremony inwhich I frequently saw Mehevi and several other chefs andwarriors of note take part; but never a single female.</p><p> Among those whom I looked upon as forming the priesthood of thevalley, there was one in particular who often attracted mynotice, and whom I could not help regarding as the head of theorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a noble looking man, in the prime of his life, andof a most benignant aspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority this man, whose namewas Kolory, seemed to exercise over the rest, the episcopal parthe took in the Feast of Calabashes, his sleek and complacentappearance, the mystic characters which were tattooed upon hischest, and above all the mitre he frequently wore, in the shapeof a towering head-dress, consisting of part of a cocoanutbranch, the stalk planted uprightly on his brow, and the leafletsgathered together and passed round the temples and behind theears, all these pointed him out as Lord Primate of Typee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kolorywas a sort of Knight Templar--a soldier-priest; for he often worethe dress of a Marquesan warrior, and always carried a longspear, which, instead of terminating in a paddle at the lowerend, after the general fashion of these weapons, was curved intoa heathenish-looking little image.&nbsp;&nbsp;This instrument, however,might perhaps have been emblematic of his double functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Withone end in carnal combat he transfixed the enemies of his tribe;and with the other as a pastoral crook he kept in order hisspiritual flock.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not all I have to say about Kolory.</p><p> His martial grace very often carried about with him what seemedto me the half of a broken war-club.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was swathed round withragged bits of white tappa, and the upper part, which wasintended to represent a human head, was embellished with a stripof scarlet cloth of European manufacture.&nbsp;&nbsp;It required littleobservation to discover that this strange object was revered as agod.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the side of the big and lusty images standing sentinelover the altars of the Hoolah Hoolah ground, it seemed a merepigmy in tatters.&nbsp;&nbsp;But appearances all the world over aredeceptive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Little men are sometimes very potent, and ragssometimes cover very extensive pretensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this funnylittle image was the 'crack' god of the island; lording it overall the wooden lubbers who looked so grim and dreadful; its namewas Moa Artua*.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was in honour of Moa Artua, and for theentertainment of those who believe in him, that the curiousceremony I am about to describe was observed.</p><p> *The word 'Artua', although having some other significations, isin nearly all the Polynesian dialects used as the generaldesignation of the gods.</p><p> </p><p> Mehevi and the chieftains of the Ti have just risen from theirnoontide slumbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no affairs of state to dispose of;and having eaten two or three breakfasts in the course of themorning, the magnates of the valley feel no appetite as yet fordinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;How are their leisure moments to be occupied?&nbsp;&nbsp;Theysmoke, they chat, and at last one of their number makes aproposition to the rest, who joyfully acquiescing, he darts outof the house, leaps from the pi-pi, and disappears in the grove.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon you see him returning with Kolory, who bears the god MoaArtua in his arms, and carries in one hand a small trough,hollowed out in the likeness of a canoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest comes alongdandling his charge as if it were a lachrymose infant he wasendeavouring to put into a good humour.&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently entering theTi, he seats himself on the mats as composedly as a juggler aboutto perform his sleight-of-hand tricks; and with the chiefsdisposed in a circle around him, commences his ceremony.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inthe,first place he gives Moa Artua an affectionate hug, thencaressingly lays him to his breast, and, finally, whisperssomething in his ear; the rest of the company listening eagerlyfor a reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the baby-god is deaf or dumb,--perhaps both,for never a word does, he utter.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last Kolory speaks a littlelouder, and soon growing angry, comes boldly out with what he hasto say and bawls to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He put me in mind of a choleric fellow,who, after trying in vain to communicated a secret to a deaf man,all at once flies into a passion and screams it out so that everyone may hear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still Moa Artua remains as quiet as ever; andKolory, seemingly losing his temper, fetches him a box over thehead, strips him of his tappa and red cloth, and laying him in astate of nudity in a little trough, covers him from sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Atthis proceeding all present loudly applaud and signify theirapproval by uttering the adjective 'motarkee' with violentemphasis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kolory however, is so desirous his conduct should meetwith unqualified approbation, that he inquires of each individualseparately whether under existing circumstances he has not doneperfectly right in shutting up Moa Artua.&nbsp;&nbsp;The invariableresponse is 'Aa, Aa' (yes, yes), repeated over again and again ina manner which ought to quiet the scruples of the mostconscientious.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moments Kolory brings forth his dollagain, and while arraying it very carefully in the tappa and redcloth, alternately fondles and chides it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The toilet beingcompleted, he once more speaks to it aloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole companyhereupon show the greatest interest; while the priest holding MoaArtua to his ear interprets to them what he pretends the god isconfidentially communicating to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some items intelligenceappear to tickle all present amazingly; for one claps his handsin a rapture; another shouts with merriment; and a third leaps tohis feet and capers about like a madman.</p><p> What under the sun Moa Artua on these occasions had to say toKolory I never could find out; but I could not help thinking thatthe former showed a sad want of spirit in being disciplined intomaking those disclosures, which at first he seemed bent onwithholding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the priest honestly interpreted what hebelieved the divinity said to him, or whether he was not all thewhile guilty of a vile humbug, I shall not presume to decide.&nbsp;&nbsp;Atany rate, whatever as coming from the god was imparted to thosepresent seemed to be generally of a complimentary nature: a factwhich illustrates the sagacity of Kolory, or else the timeservingdisposition of this hardly used deity.</p><p> Moa Artua having nothing more to say, his bearer goes to nursinghim again, in which occupation, however, he is soon interruptedby a question put by one of the warriors to the god.&nbsp;&nbsp;Koloryhereupon snatches it up to his ear again, and after listeningattentively, once more officiates as the organ of communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;A multitude of questions and answers having passed between theparties, much to the satisfaction of those who propose them, thegod is put tenderly to bed in the trough, and the whole companyunite in a long chant, led off by Kolory.&nbsp;&nbsp;This ended, theceremony is over; the chiefs rise to their feet in high goodhumour, and my Lord Archbishop, after chatting awhile, andregaling himself with a whiff or two from a pipe of tobacco,tucks the canoe under his arm and marches off with it.</p><p> The whole of these proceedings were like those of a parcel ofchildren playing with dolls and baby houses.</p><p> For a youngster scarcely ten inches high, and with so few earlyadvantages as he doubtless had had, Moa Artua was certainly aprecocious little fellow if he really said all that was imputedto him; but for what reason this poor devil of a deity, thuscuffed about, cajoled, and shut up in a box, was held in greaterestimation than the full-grown and dignified personages of theTaboo Groves, I cannot divine.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet Mehevi, and other chiefsof unquestionable veracity--to say nothing of the Primatehimself--assured me over and over again that Moa Artua was thetutelary deity of Typee, and was more to be held in honour than awhole battalion of the clumsy idols in the Hoolah Hoolah grounds.</p><p> Kory-Kory--who seemed to have devoted considerable attention tothe study of theology, as he knew the names of all the gravenimages in the valley, and often repeated them over tome--likewise entertained some rather enlarged ideas with regardto the character and pretensions of Moa Artua.&nbsp;&nbsp;He once gave meto understand, with a gesture there was no misconceiving, that ifhe (Moa Artua) were so minded he could cause a cocoanut tree tosprout out of his (Kory-Kory's) head; and that it would be theeasiest thing in life for him (Moa Artua) to take the wholeisland of Nukuheva in his mouth and dive down to the bottom ofthe sea with it.</p><p> But in sober seriousness, I hardly knew what to make of thereligion of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing that so much perplexedthe illustrious Cook, in his intercourse with the South Seaislanders, as their sacred rites.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this prince ofnavigators was in many instances assisted by interpreters in theprosecution of his researches, he still frankly acknowledges thathe was at a loss to obtain anything like a clear insight into thepuzzling arcana of their faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar admission has beenmade by other eminent voyagers: by Carteret, Byron, Kotzebue, andVancouver.</p><p> For my own part, although hardly a day passed while I remainedupon the island that I did not witness some religious ceremony orother, it was very much like seeing a panel of 'Freemasons'making secret signs to each other; I saw everything, but couldcomprehend nothing.</p><p> On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the islanders in thePacific have no fixed and definite ideas whatever on the subjectof religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am persuaded that Kolory himself would beeffectually posed were he called upon to draw up the articles ofhis faith and pronounce the creed by which he hoped to be saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, the Typees, so far as their actions evince, submittedto no laws human or divine--always excepting the thricemysterious Taboo.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'independent electors' of the valley werenot to be brow-beaten by chiefs, priests, idol or devils.&nbsp;&nbsp;As forthe luckless idols, they received more hard knocks thansupplications.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wonder that some of them looked so grim,and stood so bolt upright as if fearful of looking to the rightor the left lest they should give any one offence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is,they had to carry themselves 'PRETTY STRAIGHT,' or suffer theconsequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their worshippers were such a precious set offickle-minded and irreverent heathens, that there was no tellingwhen they might topple one of them over, break it to pieces, andmaking a fire with it on the very altar itself, fall to roastingthe offerings of bread-fruit, and at them in spite of its teeth.</p><p> In how little reverence these unfortunate deities were held bythe natives was on one occasion most convincingly proved tome.--Walking with Kory-Kory through the deepest recesses of thegroves, I perceived a curious looking image, about six feet inheight which originally had been placed upright against a lowpi-pi, surmounted by a ruinous bamboo temple, but having becomefatigued and weak in the knees, was now carelessly leaningagainst it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The idol was partly concealed by the foliage of atree which stood near, and whose leafy boughs drooped over thepile of stones, as if to protect the rude fane from the decay towhich it was rapidly hastening.&nbsp;&nbsp;The image itself was nothingmore than a grotesquely shaped log, carved in the likeness of aportly naked man with the arms clasped over the head, the jawsthrown wide apart, and its thick shapeless legs bowed into anarch.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was much decayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower part was overgrown with abright silky moss.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin spears of grass sprouted from thedistended mouth, and fringed the outline of the head and arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;His godship had literally attained a green old age.&nbsp;&nbsp;All itsprominent points were bruised and battered, or entirely rottedaway.&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose had taken its departure, and from the generalappearance of the head it might have, been supposed that thewooden divinity, in despair at the neglect of its worshippers,had been trying to beat its own brains out against thesurrounding trees.</p><p> I drew near to inspect more closely this strange object ofidolatry, but halted reverently at the distance of two or threepaces, out of regard to the religious prejudices of my valet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoon, however, as Kory-Kory perceived that I was in one of myinquiring, scientific moods, to my astonishment, he sprang to theside of the idol, and pushing it away from the stones againstwhich it rested, endeavoured to make it stand upon its legs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Butthe divinity had lost the use of them altogether; and whileKory-Kory was trying to prop it up, placing a stick between itand the pi-pi, the monster fell clumsily to the ground, and wouldhave infallibly have broken its neck had not Kory-Koryprovidentially broken its fall by receiving its whole weight onhis own half-crushed back.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never saw the honest fellow in sucha rage before.&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaped furiously to his feet, and seizing thestick, began beating the poor image: every moment, or two pausingand talking to it in the most violent manner, as if upbraiding itfor the accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;When his indignation had subsided a little hewhirled the idol about most profanely, so as to give me anopportunity of examining it on all sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure Inever should have presumed to have taken such liberties with thegod myself, and I was not a little shocked at Kory-Kory'simpiety.</p><p> This anecdote speaks for itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;When one of the inferior orderof natives could show such contempt for a venerable and decrepitGod of the Groves, what the state of religion must be among thepeople in general is easy to be imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, I regard theTypees as a back-slidden generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are sunk in religioussloth, and require a spiritual revival.&nbsp;&nbsp;A long prosperity ofbread-fruit and cocoanuts has rendered them remiss in theperformance of their higher obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood-rot malady isspreading among the idols--the fruit upon their altars isbecoming offensive--the temples themselves need rethatching--thetattooed clergy are altogether too light-hearted and lazy--andtheir flocks are going astray.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twenty-five</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p> GENERAL INFORMATION GATHERED AT THE FESTIVAL--PERSONAL BEAUTY OFTHE TYPEES--THEIR SUPERIORITY OVER THE INHABITANTS OF THE OTHERISLANDS--DIVERSITY OF COMPLEXION--A VEGETABLE COSMETIC ANDOINTMENT--TESTIMONY OF VOYAGERS TO THE UNCOMMON BEAUTY OF THEMARQUESANS--FEW EVIDENCES OF INTERCOURSE WITH CIVILIZEDBEINGS--DILAPIDATED MUSKET--PRIMITIVE SIMPLICITY OF GOVERNMENT-REGAL DIGNITY OF MEHEVI</p><p> ALTHOUGH I had been unable during the late festival to obtaininformation on many interesting subjects which had much excitedmy curiosity, still that important event had not passed bywithout adding materially to my general knowledge of theislanders.</p><p> I was especially struck by the physical strength and beauty whichthey displayed, by their great superiority in these respects overthe inhabitants of the neighbouring bay of Nukuheva, and by thesingular contrasts they presented among themselves in theirvarious shades of complexion.</p><p> In beauty of form they surpassed anything I had ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not asingle instance of natural deformity was observable in all thethrong attending the revels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally I noticed among themen the scars of wounds they had received in battle; andsometimes, though very seldom, the loss of a finger, an eye, oran arm, attributable to the same cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;With these exceptions,every individual appeared free from those blemishes whichsometimes mar the effect of an otherwise perfect form.&nbsp;&nbsp;But theirphysical excellence did not merely consist in an exemption fromthese evils; nearly every individual of their number might havebeen taken for a sculptor's model.</p><p> When I remembered that these islanders derived no advantage fromdress, but appeared in all the naked simplicity of nature, Icould not avoid comparing them with the fine gentlemen anddandies who promenade such unexceptionable figures in ourfrequented thoroughfares.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped of the cunning artifices ofthe tailor, and standing forth in the garb of Eden--what a sorry,set of round-shouldered, spindle-shanked, crane-necked varletswould civilized men appear!&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuffed calves, padded breasts, andscientifically cut pantaloons would then avail them nothing, andthe effect would be truly deplorable.</p><p> Nothing in the appearance of the islanders struck me moreforcibly than the whiteness of their teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The novelist alwayscompares the masticators of his heroine to ivory; but I boldlypronounce the teeth of the Typee to be far more beautiful thanivory itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;The jaws of the oldest graybeards among them weremuch better garnished than those of most of the youths ofcivilized countries; while the teeth of the young andmiddle-aged, in their purity and whiteness, were actuallydazzling to the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their marvellous whiteness of the teeth isto be ascribed to the pure vegetable diet of these people, andthe uninterrupted healthfulness of their natural mode of life.</p><p> The men, in almost every instance, are of lofty stature, scarcelyever less than six feet in height, while the other sex areuncommonly diminutive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The early period of life at which thehuman form arrives at maturity in this generous tropical climate,likewise deserves to be mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;A little creature, not morethan thirteen years of age, and who in other particulars might beregarded as a mere child, is often seen nursing her own baby,whilst lads who, under less ripening skies, would be still atschool, are here responsible fathers of families.</p><p> On first entering the Typee Valley, I had been struck with themarked contrast presented by its inhabitants with those of thebay I had previously left.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latter place, I had not beenfavourably impressed with the personal appearance of the maleportion of the population; although with the females, exceptingin some truly melancholy instances, I had been wonderfullypleased.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had observed that even the little intercourseEuropeans had carried on with the Nukuheva natives had not failedto leave its traces amongst them.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most dreadfulcurses under which humanity labours had commenced its havocks,and betrayed, as it ever does among the South Sea islanders, themost aggravated symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, as from all other foreigninflictions, the yet uncontaminated tenants of the Typee Valleywere wholly exempt; and long may they continue so.&nbsp;&nbsp;Better willit be for them for ever to remain the happy and innocent heathensand barbarians that they now are, than, like the wretchedinhabitants of the Sandwich Islands, to enjoy the mere name ofChristians without experiencing any of the vital operations oftrue religion, whilst, at the same time, they are made thevictims of the worst vices and evils of civilized life.</p><p> Apart, however, from these considerations, I am inclined tobelieve that there exists a radical difference between the twotribes, if indeed they are not distinct races of men.&nbsp;&nbsp;To thosewho have merely touched at Nukuheva Bay, without visiting otherportions of the island, it would hardly appear credible thediversities presented between the various small clans inhabitingso diminutive a spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the hereditary hostility which hasexisted between them for ages, fully accounts for this.</p><p> Not so easy, however, is it to assign an adequate cause for theendless variety of complexions to be seen in the Typee Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the festival, I had noticed several young females whoseskins were almost as white as any Saxon damsel's; a slight dashof the mantling brown being all that marked the difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thiscomparative fairness of complexion, though in a great degreeperfectly natural, is partly the result of an artificial process,and of an entire exclusion from the sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;The juice of the 'papa'root found in great abundance at the head of the valley, is heldin great esteem as a cosmetic, with which many of the femalesdaily anoint their whole person.&nbsp;&nbsp;The habitual use of it whitensand beautifies the skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of the young girls who resort tothis method of heightening their charms, never expose themselvesselves to the rays of the sun; an observance, however, thatproduces little or no inconvenience, since there are but few ofthe inhabited portions of the vale which are not shaded over witha spreading canopy of boughs, so that one may journey from houseto house, scarcely deviating from the direct course, and yetnever once see his shadow cast upon the ground.</p><p> The 'papa', when used, is suffered to remain upon the skin forseveral hours; being of a light green colour, it consequentlyimparts for the time a similar hue to the complexion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing,therefore, can be imagined more singular than the appearance ofthese nearly naked damsels immediately after the application ofthe cosmetic.&nbsp;&nbsp;To look at one of them you would almost supposeshe was some vegetable in an unripe state; and that, instead ofliving in the shade for ever, she ought to be placed out in thesun to ripen.</p><p> All the islanders are more or less in the habit of anointingthemselves; the women preferring the 'aker' to 'papa', and themen using the oil of the cocoanut.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mehevi was remarkable fond ofmollifying his entire cuticle with this ointment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes hemight be seen, with his whole body fairly reeking with theperfumed oil of the nut, looking as if he had just emerged from asoap-boiler's vat, or had undergone the process of dipping in atallow-chandlery.&nbsp;&nbsp;To this cause perhaps, united to theirfrequent bathing and extreme cleanliness, is ascribable, in agreat measure, the marvellous purity and smoothness of skinexhibited by the natives in general.</p><p> The prevailing tint among the women of the valley was a lightolive, and of this style of complexion Fayaway afforded the mostbeautiful example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others were still darker; while not a fewwere of a genuine golden colour, and some of a swarthy hue.</p><p> As agreeing with much previously mentioned in this narrative Imay here observe that Mendanna, their discoverer, in his accountof the Marquesas, described the natives as wondrously beautifulto behold, and as nearly resembling the people of southernEurope.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these islands seen by Mendanna was LaMadelena, which is not far distant from Nukuheva; and itsinhabitants in every respect resemble those dwelling on that andthe other islands of the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figueroa, the chronicler ofMendanna's voyage, says, that on the morning the land wasdescried, when the Spaniards drew near the shore, there salliedforth, in rude progression, about seventy canoes, and at the sametime many of the inhabitants (females I presume) made towards theships by swimming.&nbsp;&nbsp;He adds, that 'in complexion they were nearlywhite; of good stature, and finely formed; and on their faces andbodies were delineated representations of fishes and otherdevices'.&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Don then goes on to say, 'There came, amongothers, two lads paddling their canoe, whose eyes were fixed onthe ship; they had beautiful faces and the most promisinganimation of countenance; and were in all things so becoming,that the pilot-mayor Quiros affirmed, nothing in his life evercaused him so much regret as the leaving such fine creatures tobe lost in that country.'*&nbsp;&nbsp;More than two hundred years have goneby since the passage of which the above is a translation waswritten; and it appears to me now, as I read it, as fresh andtrue as if written but yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;The islanders are still thesame; and I have seen boys in the Typee Valley of whose'beautiful faces' and promising 'animation of countenance' no onewho has not beheld them can form any adequate idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cook, in theaccount of his voyage, pronounces the Marquesans as by far themost splendid islanders in the South Seas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stewart, the chaplainof the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;ship Vincennes, in his 'Scenes in the South Seas',expresses, in more than one place, his amazement at thesurpassing loveliness of the women; and says that many of theNukuheva damsels reminded him forcibly of the most celebratedbeauties in his own land.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanning, a Yankee mariner of somereputation, likewise records his lively impressions of thephysical appearance of these people; and Commodore David Porterof the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;frigate Essex, is said to have been vastly smittenby the beauty of the ladies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their great superiority over allother Polynesians cannot fail to attract the notice of those whovisit the principal groups in the Pacific.&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluptuousTahitians are the only people who at all deserve to be comparedwith them; while the dark-haired Hawaiians and the woolly-headedFeejees are immeasurably inferior to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinguishingcharacteristic of the Marquesan islanders, and that which at oncestrikes you, is the European cast of their features--apeculiarity seldom observable among other uncivilized people. Many of their faces present profiles classically beautiful, andin the valley of Typee I saw several who, like the strangerMarnoo, were in every respect models of beauty.</p><p> * This passage, which is cited as an almost literal translationfrom the original, I found in a small volume entitled'Circumnavigation of the Globe, in which volume are severalextracts from 'Dalrymple's Historical Collections'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thelast-mentioned work I have never seen, but it is said to containa very correct English version of great part of the learnedDoctor Christoval Suaverde da Figueroa's History of Mendanna'sVoyage, published at Madrid, A.D.&nbsp;&nbsp;1613.</p><p> </p><p> Some of the natives present at the Feast of Calabashes haddisplayed a few articles of European dress; disposed however,about their persons after their own peculiar fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongthese I perceived two pieces of cotton-cloth which poor Toby andmyself had bestowed upon our youthful guides the afternoon weentered the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were evidently reserved for gala days;and during those of the festival they rendered the youngislanders who wore them very distinguished characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;The smallnumber who were similarly adorned, and the great value theyappeared to place upon the most common and most trivial articles,furnished ample evidence of the very restricted intercourse theyheld with vessels touching at the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few cottonhandkerchiefs, of a gay pattern, tied about the neck, andsuffered to fall over the shoulder; strips of fanciful calico,swathed about the loins, were nearly all I saw.</p><p> Indeed, throughout the valley, there were few things of any kindto be seen of European origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;All I ever saw, besides thearticles just alluded to, were the six muskets preserved in theTi, and three or four similar implements of warfare hung up inother houses; some small canvas bags, partly filled with bulletsand powder, and half a dozen old hatchet-heads, with the edgesblunted and battered to such a degree as to render them utterlyworthless.&nbsp;&nbsp;These last seemed to be regarded as nearly worthlessby the natives; and several times they held up, one of thembefore me, and throwing it aside with a gesture of disgust,manifested their contempt for anything that could so soon becomeunserviceable.</p><p> But the muskets, the powder, and the bullets were held in mostextravagant esteem.&nbsp;&nbsp;The former, from their great age and thepeculiarities they exhibited, were well worthy a place in anyantiquarian's armoury.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in particular one that hung inthe Ti, and which Mehevi--supposing as a matter of course that Iwas able to repair it--had put into my hands for that purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one of those clumsy, old-fashioned, English pieces knowngenerally as Tower Hill muskets, and, for aught I know, mighthave been left on the island by Wallace, Carteret, Cook, orVancouver.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock was half rotten and worm-eaten; the lockwas as rusty and about as well adapted to its ostensible purposeas an old door-hinge; the threading of the screws about thetrigger was completely worn away; while the barrel shook in thewood.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the weapon the chief desired me to restore to itsoriginal condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I did not possess the accomplishments ofa gunsmith, and was likewise destitute of the necessary tools, Iwas reluctantly obliged to signify my inability to perform thetask.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this unexpected communication Mehevi regarded me, for amoment, as if he half suspected I was some inferior sort of whiteman, who after all did not know much more than a Typee.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,after a most laboured explanation of the matter, I succeeded inmaking him understand the extreme difficulty of the task.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely satisfied with my apologies, however, he marched offwith the superannuated musket in something of a huff, as if hewould no longer expose it to the indignity of being manipulatedby such unskilful fingers.</p><p> During the festival I had not failed to remark the simplicity ofmanner, the freedom from all restraint, and, to certain degree,the equality of condition manifested by the natives in general.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one appeared to assume any arrogant pretensions.&nbsp;&nbsp;There waslittle more than a slight difference in costume to distinguishthe chiefs from the other natives.&nbsp;&nbsp;All appeared to mix togetherfreely, and without any reserve; although I noticed that thewishes of a chief, even when delivered in the mildest tone,received the same immediate obedience which elsewhere would havebeen only accorded to a peremptory command.&nbsp;&nbsp;What may be theextent of the authority of the chiefs over the rest of the tribe,I will not venture to assert; but from all I saw during my stayin the valley, I was induced to believe that in mattersconcerning the general welfare it was very limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;The requireddegree of deference towards them, however, was willingly andcheerfully yielded; and as all authority is transmitted fromfather to son, I have no doubt that one of the effects here, aselsewhere, of high birth, is to induce respect and obedience.</p><p> The civil institutions of the Marquesas Islands appear to be inthis, as in other respects, directly the reverse of those of theTahitian and Hawiian groups, where the original power of the kingand chiefs was far more despotic than that of any tyrant incivilized countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;At Tahiti it used to be death for one ofthe inferior orders to approach, without permission, under theshadow, of the king's house; or to fail in paying the customaryreverence when food destined for the king was borne past them byhis messengers.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Sandwich Islands, Kaahumanu, the giganticold dowager queen--a woman of nearly four hundred pounds weight,and who is said to be still living at Mowee--was accustomed, insome of her terrific gusts of temper, to snatch up an ordinarysized man who had offended her, and snap his spine across herknee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incredible as this may seem, it is a fact.&nbsp;&nbsp;While atLahainaluna--the residence of this monstrous Jezebel--ahumpbacked wretch was pointed out to me, who, some twenty-fiveyears previously, had had the vertebrae of his backbone veryseriously discomposed by his gentle mistress.</p><p> The particular grades of rank existing among the chiefs of Typee,I could not in all cases determine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous to the Feast ofCalabashes I had been puzzled what particular station to assignto Mehevi.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the important part he took upon that occasionconvinced me that he had no superior among the inhabitants of thevalley.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had invariably noticed a certain degree of deferencepaid to him by all with whom I had ever seen him brought incontact; but when I remembered that my wanderings had beenconfined to a limited portion of the valley, and that towards thesea a number of distinguished chiefs resided, some of whom hadseparately visited me at Marheyo's house, and whom, until theFestival, I had never seen in the company of Mehevi, I feltdisposed to believe that his rank after all might not beparticularly elevated.</p><p> The revels, however, had brought together all the warriors whom Ihad seen individually and in groups at different times andplaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them Mehevi moved with an easy air of superioritywhich was not to be mistaken; and he whom I had only looked at asthe hospitable host of the Ti, and one of the military leaders ofthe tribe, now assumed in my eyes the dignity of royal station.&nbsp;&nbsp;His striking costume, no less than his naturally commandingfigure, seemed indeed to give him pre-eminence over the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering helmet of feathers that he wore raised him in heightabove all who surrounded him; and though some others weresimilarly adorned, the length and luxuriance of their plumes wereinferior to his.</p><p> Mehevi was in fact the greatest of the chiefs--the head of hisclan--the sovereign of the valley; and the simplicity of thesocial institutions of the people could not have been morecompletely proved than by the fact, that after having beenseveral weeks in the valley, and almost in daily intercourse withMehevi, I should have remained until the time of the festivalignorant of his regal character.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a new light had now brokenin upon me.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ti was the palace--and Mehevi the king.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boththe one and the other of a most simple and patriarchal nature: itmust be allowed, and wholly unattended by the ceremonious pompwhich usually surrounds the purple.</p><p> After having made this discovery I could not avoid congratulatingmyself that Mehevi had from the first taken me as it were underhis royal protection, and that he still continued to entertainfor me the warmest regard, as far at least as I was enabled tojudge from appearances.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the future I determined to pay mostassiduous court to him, hoping that eventually through hiskindness I might obtain my liberty.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twenty-six</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p> KING MEHEVI--ALLUSION TO HIS HAWIIAN MAJESTY--CONDUCT OF MARHEYOAND MEHEVI IN CERTAIN DELICATE MATTERS--PECULIAR SYSTEM OFMARRIAGE--NUMBER OF POPULATION--UNIFORMITY--EMBALMING--PLACES OFSEPULTURE--FUNERAL OBSEQUIES AT NUKUHEVA-NUMBER OF INHABITANTS INTYPEE--LOCATION OF THE DWELLINGS--HAPPINESS ENJOYED IN THEVALLEY--A WARNING--SOME IDEAS WITH REGARD TO THE PRESENT STATE OFTHE HAWIIANS--STORY OF A MISSIONARY'S WIFE--FASHIONABLE EQUIPAGESAT OAHU--REFLECTIONS</p><p> KING MEHEVI!--A goodly sounding title--and why should I notbestow it upon the foremost man in the valley of Typee?&nbsp;&nbsp;Therepublican missionaries of Oahu cause to be gazetted in the CourtJournal, published at Honolulu, the most trivial movement of 'hisgracious majesty' King Kammehammaha III, and 'their highnessesthe princes of the blood royal'.*&nbsp;&nbsp;And who is his 'graciousmajesty', and what the quality of this blood royal'?--His'gracious majesty' is a fat, lazy, negro-looking blockhead, withas little character as power.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has lost the noble traits ofthe barbarian, without acquiring the redeeming graces of acivilized being; and, although a member of the Hawiian TemperanceSociety, is a most inveterate dram-drinker.</p><p> *Accounts like these are sometimes copied into English andAmerican journals.&nbsp;&nbsp;They lead the reader to infer that the artsand customs of civilized life are rapidly refining the natives ofthe Sandwich Islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;But let no one be deceived by theseaccounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chiefs swagger about in gold lace and broadcloth,while the great mass of the common people are nearly as primitivein their appearance as in the days of Cook.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the progress ofevents at these islands, the two classes are receding from eachother; the chiefs are daily becoming more luxurious andextravagant in their style of living, and the common people moreand more destitute of the necessaries and decencies of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Butthe end to which both will arrive at last will be the same: theone are fast destroying themselves by sensual indulgences, andthe other are fast being destroyed by a complication ofdisorders, and the want of wholesome food.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resources of thedomineering chiefs are wrung from the starving serfs, and everyadditional bauble with which they bedeck themselves is purchasedby the sufferings of their bondsmen; so that the measure ofgew-gaw refinement attained by the chiefs is only an index to theactual state in which the greater portion of the population liegrovelling.</p><p> </p><p> The 'blood royal' is an extremely thick, depraved fluid; formedprincipally of raw fish, bad brandy, and European sweetmeats, andis charged with a variety of eruptive humours, which aredeveloped in sundry blotches and pimples upon the august face of'majesty itself', and the angelic countenances of the 'princesand princesses of the blood royal'!</p><p> Now, if the farcical puppet of a chief magistrate in the SandwichIslands be allowed the title of King, why should it be withheldfrom the noble savage Mehevi, who is a thousand times more worthyof the appellation?&nbsp;&nbsp;All hail, therefore, Mehevi, King of theCannibal Valley, and long life and prosperity to his Typeeanmajesty!&nbsp;&nbsp;May Heaven for many a year preserve him, theuncompromising foe of Nukuheva and the French, if a hostileattitude will secure his lovely domain from the remorselessinflictions of South Sea civilization.</p><p> Previously to seeing the Dancing Widows I had little idea thatthere were any matrimonial relations subsisting in Typee, and Ishould as soon have thought of a Platonic affection beingcultivated between the sexes, as of the solemn connection of manand wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, there were old Marheyo and Tinor, whoseemed to have a sort of nuptial understanding with one another;but for all that, I had sometimes observed a comical-looking oldgentleman dressed in a suit of shabby tattooing, who had theaudacity to take various liberties with the lady, and that too inthe very presence of the old warrior her husband, who looked onas good-naturedly as if nothing was happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;This behaviour,until subsequent discoveries enlightened me, puzzled me more thananything else I witnessed in Typee.</p><p> As for Mehevi, I had supposed him a confirmed bachelor, as wellas most of the principal chiefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, if they had wivesand families, they ought to have been ashamed of themselves; forsure I am, they never troubled themselves about any domesticaffairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, Mehevi seemed to be the president of a clubof hearty fellows, who kept 'Bachelor's Hall' in fine style atthe Ti.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no doubt but that they regarded children as odiousincumbrances; and their ideas of domestic felicity weresufficiently shown in the fact, that they allowed no meddlesomehousekeepers to turn topsy-turvy those snug little arrangementsthey had made in their comfortable dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;I stronglysuspected however, that some of these jolly bachelors werecarrying on love intrigues with the maidens of the tribe;although they did not appear publicly to acknowledge them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ihappened to pop upon Mehevi three or four times when he wasromping--in a most undignified manner for a warrior king--withone of the prettiest little witches in the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;She livedwith an old woman and a young man, in a house near Marheyo's; andalthough in appearance a mere child herself, had a noble boyabout a year old, who bore a marvellous resemblance to Mehevi,whom I should certainly have believed to have been the father,were it not that the little fellow had no triangle on hisface--but on second thoughts, tattooing is not hereditary.Mehevi, however, was not the only person upon whom the damselMoonoony smiled--the young fellow of fifteen, who permanentlyresided in the home with her, was decidedly in her good graces.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes beheld both him and the chief making love at the sametime.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible, thought I, that the valiant warrior canconsent to give up a corner in the thing he loves?&nbsp;&nbsp;This too wasa mystery which, with others of the same kind, was afterwardssatisfactorily explained.</p><p> During the second day of the Feast of Calabashes,Kory-Kory--being determined that I should have some understandingon these matters--had, in the course of his explanations,directed my attention to a peculiarity I had frequently remarkedamong many of the females;--principally those of a mature age andrather matronly appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;This consisted in having the righthand and the left foot most elaborately tattooed; whilst the restof the body was wholly free from the operation of the art, withthe exception of the minutely dotted lips and slight marks on theshoulders, to which I have previously referred as comprising thesole tattooing exhibited by Fayaway, in common with other younggirls of her age.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand and foot thus embellished were,according to Kory-Kory, the distinguishing badge of wedlock, sofar as that social and highly commendable institution is knownamong those people.&nbsp;&nbsp;It answers, indeed, the same purpose as theplain gold ring worn by our fairer spouses.</p><p> After Kory-Kory's explanation of the subject, I was for some timestudiously respectful in the presence of all females thusdistinguished, and never ventured to indulge in the slightestapproach to flirtation with any of their number.&nbsp;&nbsp;Married women,to be sure!--I knew better than to offend them.</p><p> A further insight, however, into the peculiar domestic customs ofthe inmates of the valley did away in a measure with the severityof my scruples, and convinced me that I was deceived in some atleast of my conclusions.&nbsp;&nbsp;A regular system of polygamy existsamong the islanders; but of a most extraordinary nature,--aplurality of husbands, instead of wives!&nbsp;&nbsp;and this solitary factspeaks volumes for the gentle disposition of the male population.</p><p> Where else, indeed, could such a practice exist, even for asingle day?--Imagine a revolution brought about in a Turkishseraglio, and the harem rendered the abode of bearded men; orconceive some beautiful woman in our own country runningdistracted at the sight of her numerous lovers murdering oneanother before her eyes, out of jealousy for the unequaldistribution of her favours!--Heaven defend us from such a stateof things!--We are scarcely amiable and forbearing enough tosubmit to it.</p><p> I was not able to learn what particular ceremony was observed informing the marriage contract, but am inclined to think that itmust have been of a very simple nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the mere'popping the question', as it is termed with us, might have beenfollowed by an immediate nuptial alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, I havemore than one reason to believe that tedious courtships areunknown in the valley of Typee.</p><p> The males considerably outnumber the females.&nbsp;&nbsp;This holds true ofmany of the islands of Polynesia, although the reverse of what isthe case in most civilized countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls are first wooedand won, at a very tender age, by some stripling in the householdin which they reside.&nbsp;&nbsp;This, however, is a mere frolic of theaffections, and no formal engagement is contracted.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the timethis first love has a little subsided, a second suitor presentshimself, of graver years, and carries both boy and girl away tohis own habitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;This disinterested and generous-heartedfellow now weds the young couple--marrying damsel and lover atthe same time--and all three thenceforth live together asharmoniously as so many turtles.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, heard of some men whoin civilized countries rashly marry large families with theirwives, but had no idea that there was any place where peoplemarried supplementary husbands with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Infidelity on eitherside is very rare.&nbsp;&nbsp;No man has more than one wife, and no wife ofmature years has less than two husbands,--sometimes she hasthree, but such instances are not frequent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The marriage tie,whatever it may be, does not appear to be indissoluble; forseparations occasionally happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;These, however, when they dotake place, produce no unhappiness, and are preceded by nobickerings; for the simple reason, than an ill-used wife or ahenpecked husband is not obliged to file a bill in Chancery toobtain a divorce.&nbsp;&nbsp;As nothing stands in the way of a separation,the matrimonial yoke sits easily and lightly, and a Typee wifelives on very pleasant and sociable terms with her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;Onthe whole, wedlock, as known among these Typees, seems to be of amore distinct and enduring nature than is usually the case withbarbarous people.&nbsp;&nbsp;A baneful promiscuous intercourse of the sexesis hereby avoided, and virtue, without being damorously invoked,is, as it were, unconsciously practised.</p><p> The contrast exhibited between the Marquesas and other islands ofthe Pacific in this respect, is worthy of being noticed.&nbsp;&nbsp;AtTahiti the marriage tie was altogether unknown; and the relationof husband and wife, father and son, could hardly be said toexist.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arreory Society--one of the most singularinstitutions that ever existed in any part of the world--spreaduniversal licentiousness over the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the voluptuouscharacter of these people which rendered the disease introducedamong them by De Bougainville's ships; in 1768, doublydestructive.&nbsp;&nbsp;It visited them like a plague, sweeping them off byhundreds.</p><p> Notwithstanding the existence of wedlock among the Typees, theScriptural injunction to increase and multiply seems to be butindifferently attended to.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never saw any of those largefamilies in arithmetical or step-ladder progression which oneoften meets with at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never knew of more than twoyoungsters living together in the same home, and but seldom eventhat number.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the women, it was very plain that theanxieties of the nursery but seldom disturbed the serenity oftheir souls; and they were never seen going about the valley withhalf a score of little ones tagging at their apronstrings, orrather at the bread-fruit-leaf they usually wore in the rear.</p><p> The ratio of increase among all the Polynesian nations is verysmall; and in some places as yet uncorrupted by intercourse withEuropeans, the births would appear not very little to outnumberthe deaths; the population in such instances remaining nearly thesame for several successive generations, even upon those islandsseldom or never desolated by wars, and among people with whom thecrime of infanticide is altogether unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would seemexpressively ordained by Providence to prevent the overstockingof the islands with a race too indolent to cultivate the ground,and who, for that reason alone, would, by any considerableincrease in their numbers, be exposed to the most deplorablemisery.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the entire period of my stay in the valley ofTypee, I never saw more than ten or twelve children under the ageof six months, and only became aware of two births.</p><p> It is to the looseness of the marriage tie that the late rapiddecrease of the population of the Sandwich Islands and of Tahitiis in part to be ascribed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vices and diseases introducedamong these unhappy people annually swell the ordinary mortalityof the islands, while, from the same cause, the originally smallnumber of births is proportionally decreased.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the progressof the Hawiians and Tahitians to utter extinction is acceleratedin a sort of compound ratio.</p><p> I have before had occasion to remark, that I never saw any of theordinary signs of a pace of sepulture in the valley, acircumstance which I attributed, at the time, to my living in aparticular part of it, and being forbidden to extend my ramble toany considerable distance towards the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have since thoughtit probable, however, that the Typees, either desirous ofremoving from their sight the evidences of mortality, or promptedby a taste for rural beauty, may have some charming cemeterysituation in the shadowy recesses along the base of themountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;At Nukuheva, two or three large quadrangular'pi-pis', heavily flagged, enclosed with regular stone walls, andshaded over and almost hidden from view by the interlacingbranches of enormous trees, were pointed out to me asburial-places.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodies, I understood, were deposited in rudevaults beneath the flagging, and were suffered to remain therewithout being disinterred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although nothing could be morestrange and gloomy than the aspect of these places, where thelofty trees threw their dark shadows over rude blocks of stone, astranger looking at them would have discerned none of theordinary evidences of a place of sepulture.</p><p> During my stay in the valley, as none of its inmates were soaccommodating as to die and be buried in order to gratify mycuriosity with regard to their funeral rites, I was reluctantlyobliged to remain in ignorance of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have reason tobelieve, however, the observances of the Typees in these mattersare the same with those of all the other tribes in the island, Iwill here relate a scene I chanced to witness at Nukuheva.</p><p> A young man had died, about daybreak, in a house near the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been sent ashore that morning, and saw a good deal of thepreparations they were making for his obsequies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The body,neatly wrapped in a new white tappa, was laid out in an open shedof cocoanut boughs, upon a bier constructed of elastic bamboosingeniously twisted together.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was supported about two feetfrom the ground, by large canes planted uprightly in the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two females, of a dejected appearance, watched by its side,plaintively chanting and beating the air with large grass fanswhitened with pipe-clay.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dwelling-house adjoining anumerous company we assembled, and various articles of food werebeing prepared for consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or three individuals,distinguished by head-dresses of beautiful tappa, and wearing agreat number of ornaments, appeared to officiate as masters ofthe ceremonies.&nbsp;&nbsp;By noon the entertainment had fairly begun andwe were told that it would last during the whole of the twofollowing days.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of those who mourned by thecorpse, every one seemed disposed to drown the sense of the latebereavement in convivial indulgence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls, decked out intheir savage finery, danced; the old men chanted; the warriorssmoked and chatted; and the young and lusty, of both sexes,feasted plentifully, and seemed to enjoy themselves as pleasantlyas they could have done had it been a wedding.</p><p> The islanders understand the art of embalming, and practise itwith such success that the bodies of their great chiefs arefrequently preserved for many years in the very houses where theydied.&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw three of these in my visit to the Bay of Tior.&nbsp;&nbsp;Onewas enveloped in immense folds of tappa, with only the faceexposed, and hung erect against the side of the dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theothers were stretched out upon biers of bamboo, in open, elevatedtemples, which seemed consecrated to their memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads ofenemies killed in battle are invariably preserved and hung up astrophies in the house of the conqueror.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not acquainted withthe process which is in use, but believe that fumigation is theprincipal agency employed.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the remains which I saw presentedthe appearance of a ham after being suspended for some time in asmoky chimney.</p><p> But to return from the dead to the living.&nbsp;&nbsp;The late festival haddrawn together, as I had every reason to believe, the wholepopulation of the vale, and consequently I was enabled to makesome estimate with regard to its numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should imagine thatthere were about two thousand inhabitants in Typee; and no numbercould have been better adapted to the extent of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thevalley is some nine miles in length, and may average one inbreadth; the houses being distributed at wide intervalsthroughout its whole extent, principally, however, towards thehead of the vale.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no villages; the houses stand hereand there in the shadow of the groves, or are scattered along thebanks of the winding stream; their golden-hued bamboo sides andgleaming white thatch forming a beautiful contrast to theperpetual verdure in which they are embowered.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are noroads of any kind in the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but a labyrinth offootpaths twisting and turning among the thickets without end.</p><p> The penalty of the Fall presses very lightly upon the valley ofTypee; for, with the one solitary exception of striking a light,I scarcely saw any piece of work performed there which caused thesweat to stand upon a single brow.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for digging and delvingfor a livelihood, the thing is altogether unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature hasplanted the bread-fruit and the banana, and in her own good timeshe brings them to maturity, when the idle savage stretches forthhis hand, and satisfies his appetite.</p><p> Ill-fated people!&nbsp;&nbsp;I shudder when I think of the change a fewyears will produce in their paradisaical abode; and probably whenthe most destructive vices, and the worst attendances oncivilization, shall have driven all peace and happiness from thevalley, the magnanimous French will proclaim to the world thatthe Marquesas Islands have been converted to Christianity!&nbsp;&nbsp;andthis the Catholic world will doubtless consider as a gloriousevent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven help the 'Isles of the Sea'!--The sympathy whichChristendom feels for them, has, alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;in too many instancesproved their bane.</p><p> How little do some of these poor islanders comprehend when theylook around them, that no inconsiderable part of their disastersoriginate in certain tea-party excitements, under the influenceof which benevolent-looking gentlemen in white cravats solicitalms, and old ladies in spectacles, and young ladies in soberrusset gowns, contribute sixpences towards the creation of afund, the object of which is to ameliorate the spiritualcondition of the Polynesians, but whose end has almost invariablybeen to accomplish their temporal destruction!</p><p> Let the savages be civilized, but civilize them with benefits,and not with evils; and let heathenism be destroyed, but not bydestroying the heathen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Anglo-Saxon hive have extirpatedPaganism from the greater part of the North American continent;but with it they have likewise extirpated the greater portion ofthe Red race.&nbsp;&nbsp;Civilization is gradually sweeping from the earththe lingering vestiges of Paganism, and at the same time theshrinking forms of its unhappy worshippers.</p><p> Among the islands of Polynesia, no sooner are the imagesoverturned, the temples demolished, and the idolators convertedinto NOMINAL Christians, that disease, vice, and premature deathmake their appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The depopulated land is then recruitedfrom the rapacious, hordes of enlightened individuals who settlethemselves within its borders, and clamorously announce theprogress of the Truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neat villas, trim gardens, shaven lawns,spires, and cupolas arise, while the poor savage soon findshimself an interloper in the country of his fathers, and that tooon the very site of the hut where he was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;The spontaneousfruits of the earth, which God in his wisdom had ordained for thesupport of the indolent natives, remorselessly seized upon andappropriated by the stranger, are devoured before the eyes of thestarving inhabitants, or sent on board the numerous vessels whichnow touch at their shores.</p><p> When the famished wretches are cut off in this manner from theirnatural supplies, they are told by their benefactors to work andearn their support by the sweat of their brows!&nbsp;&nbsp;But to no finegentleman born to hereditary opulence, does this manual labourcome more unkindly than to the luxurious Indian when thus robbedof the bounty of heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;Habituated to a life of indolence, hecannot and will not exert himself; and want, disease, and vice,all evils of foreign growth, soon terminate his miserableexistence.</p><p> But what matters all this?&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold the glorious result!--Theabominations of Paganism have given way to the pure rites of theChristian worship,--the ignorant savage has been supplanted bythe refined European!&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Honolulu, the metropolis of theSandwich Islands!--A community of disinterested merchants, anddevoted self-exiled heralds of the Cross, located on the veryspot that twenty years ago was defiled by the presence ofidolatry.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a subject for an eloquent Bible-melting orator!&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor has such an opportunity for a display of missionary rhetoricbeen allowed to pass by unimproved!--But when thesephilanthropists send us such glowing accounts of one half oftheir labours, why does their modesty restrain them frompublishing the other half of the good they have wrought?--Notuntil I visited Honolulu was I aware of the fact that the smallremnant of the natives had been civilized into drought-horses;and evangelized into beasts of burden.&nbsp;&nbsp;But so it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;They havebeen literally broken into the traces, and are harnessed to thevehicles of their spiritual instructors like so many dumb brutes!</p><p> .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> Lest the slightest misconception should arise from anythingthrown out in this chapter, or indeed in any other part of thevolume, let me here observe that against the cause of missionsin, the abstract no Christian can possibly be opposed: it is intruth a just and holy cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the great end proposed by itbe spiritual, the agency employed to accomplish that end ispurely earthly; and, although the object in view be theachievement of much good, that agency may nevertheless beproductive of evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, missionary undertaking, however itmay blessed of heaven, is in itself but human; and subject, likeeverything else, to errors and abuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;And have not errors andabuses crept into the most sacred places, and may there not beunworthy or incapable missionaries abroad,as well asecclesiastics of similar character at home?&nbsp;&nbsp;May not theunworthiness or incapacity of those who assume apostolicfunctions upon the remote islands of the sea more easily escapedetection by the world at large than if it were displayed in theheart of a city?&nbsp;&nbsp;An unwarranted confidence in the sanctity ofits apostles--a proneness to regard them as incapable ofguile--and an impatience of the least suspicion to theirrectitude as men or Christians, have ever been prevailing faultsin the Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is this to be wondered at: for subject asChristianity is to the assaults of unprincipled foes, we arenaturally disposed to regard everything like an exposure ofecclesiastical misconduct as the offspring of malevolence orirreligious feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even this last consideration, howevershall deter me from the honest expression of my sentiments.</p><p> There is something apparently wrong in the practical operationsof the Sandwich Islands Mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who from pure religiousmotives contribute to the support of this enterprise should takecare to ascertain that their donations, flowing through manydevious channels, at last effect their legitimate object, theconversion of the Hawaiians.&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge this not because I doubt themoral probity of those who disburse the funds, but because I knowthat they are not rightly applied.&nbsp;&nbsp;To read pathetic accounts ofmissionary hardships, and glowing descriptions of conversion, andbaptisms, taking place beneath palm-trees, is one thing; and togo to the Sandwich Islands and see the missionaries dwelling inpicturesque and prettily furnished coral-rock villas, whilst themiserable natives are committing all sorts of immorality aroundthem, is quite another.</p><p> In justice to the missionaries, however, I will willingly admit,that where-ever evils may have resulted from their collectivemismanagement of the business of the mission, and from the wantof vital piety evinced by some of their number, still the presentdeplorable condition of the Sandwich Islands is by no meanswholly chargeable against them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The demoralizing influence of adissolute foreign population, and the frequent visits of alldescriptions of vessels, have tended not a little to increase theevils alluded to.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, here, as in every case wherecivilization has in any way been introduced among those whom wecall savages, she has scattered her vices, and withheld herblessings.</p><p> As wise a man as Shakespeare has said, that the bearer of eviltidings hath but a losing office; and so I suppose will it provewith me, in communicating to the trusting friends of the HawiianMission what has been disclosed in various portions of thisnarrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am persuaded, however, that as these disclosureswill by their very nature attract attention, so they will lead tosomething which will not be without ultimate benefit to the causeof Christianity in the Sandwich Islands.</p><p> I have but one more thing to add in connection with thissubject--those things which I have stated as facts will remainfacts, in spite of whatever the bigoted or incredulous may say orwrite against them.&nbsp;&nbsp;My reflections, however, on those facts maynot be free from error.&nbsp;&nbsp;If such be the case, I claim no furtherindulgence than should be conceded to every man whose object isto do good.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twenty-seven</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p> THE SOCIAL CONDITION AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE TYPEES</p><p> I HAVE already mentioned that the influence exerted over thepeople of the valley by their chiefs was mild in the extreme; andas to any general rule or standard of conduct by which thecommonality were governed in their intercourse with each other,so far as my observation extended, I should be almost tempted tosay, that none existed on the island, except, indeed, themysterious 'Taboo' be considered as such.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the time Ilived among the Typees, no one was ever put upon his trial forany offence against the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;To all appearance there were nocourts of law or equity.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no municipal police for thepurpose of apprehending vagrants and disorderly characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inshort, there were no legal provisions whatever for the well-beingand conservation of society, the enlightened end of civilizedlegislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet everything went on in the valley with aharmony and smoothness unparalleled, I will venture to assert, inthe most select, refined, and pious associations of mortals inChristendom.&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we to explain this enigma?&nbsp;&nbsp;These islanderswere heathens!&nbsp;&nbsp;savages!&nbsp;&nbsp;ay, cannibals!&nbsp;&nbsp;and how came theywithout the aid of established law, to exhibit, in so eminent adegree, that social order which is the greatest blessing andhighest pride of the social state?</p><p> It may reasonably be inquired, how were these people governed?how were their passions controlled in their everydaytransactions?&nbsp;&nbsp;It must have been by an inherent principle ofhonesty and charity towards each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;They seemed to begoverned by that sort of tacit common-sense law which, say whatthey will of the inborn lawlessness of the human race, has itsprecepts graven on every breast.&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand principles of virtueand honour, however they may be distorted by arbitrary codes, arethe same all the world over: and where these principles areconcerned, the right or wrong of any action appears the same tothe uncultivated as to the enlightened mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to thisindwelling, this universally diffused perception of what is justand noble, that the integrity of the Marquesans in theirintercourse with each other, is to be attributed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkestnights they slept securely, with all their worldly wealth aroundthem, in houses the doors of which were never fastened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thedisquieting ideas of theft or assassination never disturbed them.</p><p> Each islander reposed beneath his own palmetto thatching, or satunder his own bread-fruit trees, with none to molest or alarmhim.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not a padlock in the valley, nor anything thatanswered the purpose of one: still there was no community ofgoods.&nbsp;&nbsp;This long spear, so elegantly carved, and highlypolished, belongs to Wormoonoo: it is far handsomer than the onewhich old Marheyo so greatly prizes; it is the most valuablearticle belonging to its owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I have seen it leaningagainst a cocoanut tree in the grove, and there it was found whensought for.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a sperm-whale tooth, graven all over withcunning devices: it is the property of Karluna; it is the mostprecious of the damsel's ornaments.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her estimation its priceis far above rubies--and yet there hangs the dental jewel by itscord of braided bark, in the girl's house, which is far back inthe valley; the door is left open, and all the inmates have goneoff to bathe in the stream.*</p><p> *The strict honesty which the inhabitants of nearly all thePolynesian Islands manifest toward each other, is in strikingcontrast with the thieving propensities some of them evince intheir intercourse with foreigners.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would almost seem that,according to their peculiar code of morals, the pilfering of ahatchet or a wrought nail from a European, is looked upon as apraiseworthy action.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rather, it may be presumed, that bearingin mind the wholesale forays made upon them by their nauticalvisitors, they consider the property of the latter as a fairobject of reprisal.&nbsp;&nbsp;This consideration, while it serves toreconcile an apparent contradiction in the moral character of theislanders, should in some measure alter that low opinion of itwhich the reader of South Sea voyages is too apt to form.</p><p> </p><p> So much for the respect in which 'personal property' is held inTypee; how secure an investment of 'real property' may be, Icannot take upon me to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the land of the valley wasthe joint property of its inhabitants, or whether it wasparcelled out among a certain number of landed proprietors whoallowed everybody to 'squat' and 'poach' as much as he or shepleased, I never could ascertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, musty parchmentsand title-deeds there were none on the island; and I am halfinclined to believe that its inhabitants hold their broad valleysin fee simple from Nature herself; to have and to hold, so longas grass grows and water runs; or until their French visitors, bya summary mode of conveyancing, shall appropriate them to theirown benefit and behoof.</p><p> Yesterday I saw Kory-Kory hie him away armed with a long pole,with which, standing on the ground, he knocked down the fruitfrom the topmost boughs of the trees, and brought them home inhis basket of cocoanut leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I see an islander, whom Iknow to reside in a distant part of the valley, doing theself-same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sloping bank of the stream are a numberof banana-trees I have often seen a score or two of young peoplemaking a merry foray on the great golden clusters, and bearingthem off, one after another, to different parts of the vale,shouting and trampling as they went.&nbsp;&nbsp;No churlish old curmudgeoncould have been the owner of that grove of bread-fruit trees, orof these gloriously yellow bunches of bananas.</p><p> From what I have said it will be perceived that there is a vastdifference between 'personal property' and 'real estate' in thevalley of Typee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some individuals, of course, are more wealthythan others.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the ridge-pole of Marheyo's housebends under the weight of many a huge packet of tappa; his longcouch is laid with mats placed one upon the other seven deep. Outside, Tinor has ranged along in her bamboo cupboard--orwhatever the place may be called--a goodly array of calabashesand wooden trenchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the house just beyond the grove, andnext to Marheyo's, occupied by Ruaruga, is not quite so wellfurnished.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three moderate-sized packagesswinging overhead: there are only two layers of mats beneath; andthe calabashes and trenchers are not so numerous, nor sotastefully stained and carved.&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, Ruaruga has ahouse--not so pretty a one, to be sure--but just as commodious asMarheyo's; and, I suppose, if he wished to vie with hisneighbour's establishment, he could do so with very littletrouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;These, in short, constituted the chief differencesperceivable in the relative wealth of the people in Typee.</p><p> Civilization does not engross all the virtues of humanity: shehas not even her full share of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;They flourish in greaterabundance and attain greater strength among many barbarouspeople.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitality of the wild Arab, the courage of theNorth American Indian, and the faithful friendship of some of thePolynesian nations, far surpass anything of a similar kind amongthe polished communities of Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;If truth and justice, andthe better principles of our nature, cannot exist unless enforcedby the statute-book, how are we to account for the socialcondition of the Typees?&nbsp;&nbsp;So pure and upright were they in allthe relations of life, that entering their valley, as I did,under the most erroneous impressions of their character, I wassoon led to exclaim in amazement: 'Are these the ferocioussavages, the blood-thirsty cannibals of whom I have heard suchfrightful tales!&nbsp;&nbsp;They deal more kindly with each other, and aremore humane than many who study essays on virtue and benevolence,and who repeat every night that beautiful prayer breathed firstby the lips of the divine and gentle Jesus.'&nbsp;&nbsp;I will franklydeclare that after passing a few weeks in this valley of theMarquesas, I formed a higher estimate of human nature than I hadever before entertained.&nbsp;&nbsp;But alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;since then I have been oneof the crew of a man-of-war, and the pent-up wickedness of fivehundred men has nearly overturned all my previous theories.</p><p> There was one admirable trait in the general character of theTypees which, more than anything else, secured my admiration: itwas the unanimity of feeling they displayed on every occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;With them there hardly appeared to be any difference of opinionupon any subject whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;They all thought and acted alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ido not conceive that they could support a debating society for asingle night: there would be nothing to dispute about; and werethey to call a convention to take into consideration the state ofthe tribe, its session would be a remarkably short one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theyshowed this spirit of unanimity in every action of life;everything was done in concert and good fellowship.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will givean instance of this fraternal feeling.</p><p> One day, in returning with Kory-Kory from my accustomed visit tothe Ti, we passed by a little opening in the grove; on one sideof which, my attendant informed me, was that afternoon to bebuilt a dwelling of bamboo.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least a hundred of the nativeswere bringing materials to the ground, some carrying in theirhands one or two of the canes which were to form the sides,others slender rods of the habiscus, strung with palmetto leaves,for the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every one contributed something to the work; andby the united, but easy, and even indolent, labours of all, theentire work was completed before sunset.&nbsp;&nbsp;The islanders, whileemployed in erecting this tenement, reminded me of a colony ofbeavers at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, they were hardly as silent anddemure as those wonderful creatures, nor were they by any meansas diligent.&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the truth they were somewhat inclined to belazy, but a perfect tumult of hilarity prevailed; and they workedtogether so unitedly, and seemed actuated by such an instinct offriendliness, that it was truly beautiful to behold.</p><p> Not a single female took part in this employment: and if thedegree of consideration in which the ever-adorable sex is held bythe men be--as the philosophers affirm--a just criterion of thedegree of refinement among a people, then I may truly pronouncethe Typees to be as polished a community as ever the sun shoneupon.&nbsp;&nbsp;The religious restrictions of the taboo alone excepted,the women of the valley were allowed every possible indulgence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere are the ladies more assiduously courted; nowhere are theybetter appreciated as the contributors to our highest enjoyments;and nowhere are they more sensible of their power.&nbsp;&nbsp;Far differentfrom their condition among many rude nations, where the women aremade to perform all the work while their ungallant lords andmasters lie buried in sloth, the gentle sex in the valley ofTypee were exempt from toil, if toil it might be called that,even in the tropical climate, never distilled one drop ofperspiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their light household occupations, together withthe manufacture of tappa, the platting of mats, and the polishingof drinking-vessels, were the only employments pertaining to thewomen.&nbsp;&nbsp;And even these resembled those pleasant avocations whichfill up the elegant morning leisure of our fashionable ladies athome.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in these occupations, slight and agreeable though theywere, the giddy young girls very seldom engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed thesewilful care-killing damsels were averse to all useful employment.</p><p> Like so many spoiled beauties, they ranged through thegroves--bathed in the stream--danced--flirted--played all mannerof mischievous pranks, and passed their days in one merry roundof thoughtless happiness.</p><p> During my whole stay on the island I never witnessed a singlequarrel, nor anything that in the slightest degree approachedeven to a dispute.&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives appeared to form one household,whose members were bound together by the ties of strongaffection.&nbsp;&nbsp;The love of kindred I did not so much perceive, forit seemed blended in the general love; and where all were treatedas brothers and sisters, it was hard to tell who were actuallyrelated to each other by blood.</p><p> Let it not be supposed that I have overdrawn this picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ihave not done so.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor let it be urged, that the hostility ofthis tribe to foreigners, and the hereditary feuds they carry onagainst their fellow-islanders beyond the mountains, are factswhich contradict me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so; these apparent discrepancies areeasily reconciled.&nbsp;&nbsp;By many a legendary tale of violence andwrong, as well as by events which have passed before their eyes,these people have been taught to look upon white men withabhorrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cruel invasion of their country by Porter hasalone furnished them with ample provocation; and I can sympathizein the spirit which prompts the Typee warrior to guard all thepasses to his valley with the point of his levelled spear, and,standing upon the beach, with his back turned upon his greenhome, to hold at bay the intruding European.</p><p> As to the origin of the enmity of this particular clan towardsthe neighbouring tribes, I cannot so confidently speak.&nbsp;&nbsp;I willnot say that their foes are the aggressors, nor will I endeavourto palliate their conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;But surely, if our evil passions mustfind vent, it is far better to expend them on strangers andaliens, than in the bosom of the community in which we dwell.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inmany polished countries civil contentions, as well as domesticenmities, are prevalent, and the same time that the mostatrocious foreign wars are waged.&nbsp;&nbsp;How much less guilty, then,are our islanders, who of these three sins are only chargeablewith one, and that the least criminal!</p><p> The reader will ere long have reason to suspect that the Typeesare not free from the guilt of cannibalism; and he will then,perhaps, charge me with admiring a people against whom so odiousa crime is chargeable.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this only enormity in their characteris not half so horrible as it is usually described.&nbsp;&nbsp;According tothe popular fictions, the crews of vessels, shipwrecked on somebarbarous coast, are eaten alive like so many dainty joints bythe uncivil inhabitants; and unfortunate voyagers are lured intosmiling and treacherous bays; knocked on the head with outlandishwar-clubs; and served up without any prelimary dressing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Intruth, so horrific and improbable are these accounts, that manysensible and well-informed people will not believe that anycannibals exist; and place every book of voyages which purportsto give any account of them, on the same shelf with Blue Beardand Jack the Giant-Killer.&nbsp;&nbsp;While others, implicitly creditingthe most extravagant fictions, firmly believe that there arepeople in the world with tastes so depraved that they wouldinfinitely prefer a single mouthful of material humanity to agood dinner of roast beef and plum pudding.&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, Truth, wholoves to be centrally located, is again found between the twoextremes;

butnone of them can be more so than the inhabitants of Typee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Icould not comprehend, therefore, why they so seldom sought it intheir waters, for it was only at stated times that the fishingparties were formed, and these occasions were always lookedforward to with no small degree of interest.</p><p> During their absence the whole population of the place were in aferment, and nothing was talked of but 'pehee, pehee' (fish,fish).&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the time when they were expected to return thevocal telegraph was put into operation--the inhabitants, who werescattered throughout the length of the valley, leaped upon rocksand into trees, shouting with delight at the thoughts of theanticipated treat.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the approach of the party wasannounced, there was a general rush of the men towards the beach;some of them remaining, however, about the Ti in order to getmatters in readiness for the reception of the fish, which werebrought to the Taboo Groves in immense packages of leaves, eachone of them being suspended from a pole carried on the shouldersof two men.</p><p> I was present at the Ti on one of these occasions, and the sightwas most interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the packages had arrived, theywere laid in a row under the verandah of the building and opened.</p><p> The fish were all quite small, generally about the size of aherring, and of every variety.&nbsp;&nbsp;About one-eighth of the wholebeing reserved for the use of the Ti itself, the remainder wasdivided into numerous smaller packages, which were immediatelydispatched in every direction to the remotest parts of thevalley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrived at their destination, these were in turnportioned out, and equally distributed among the various housesof each particular district.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish were under a strict Taboo,until the distribution was completed, which seemed to be effectedin the most impartial manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the operation of this systemevery man, woman, and child in the vale, were at one and the sametime partaking of this favourite article of food.</p><p> Once I remember the party arrived at midnight; but theunseasonableness of the tour did not repress the impatience ofthe islanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriers dispatched from the Ti were to beseen hurrying in all directions through the deep groves; eachindividual preceded by a boy bearing a flaming torch of driedcocoanut boughs, which from time to time was replenished from thematerials scattered along the path.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild glare of theseenormous flambeaux, lighting up with a startling brilliancy theinnermost recesses of the vale, and seen moving rapidly alongbeneath the canopy of leaves, the savage shout of the excitedmessengers sounding the news of their approach, which wasanswered on all sides, and the strange appearance of their nakedbodies, seen against the gloomy background, produced altogetheran effect upon my mind that I shall long remember.</p><p> It was on this same occasion that Kory-Kory awakened me at thedead hour of night, and in a sort of transport communicated theintelligence contained in the words 'pehee perni' (fish come).&nbsp;&nbsp;As I happened to have been in a remarkably sound and refreshingslumber, I could not imagine why the information had not beendeferred until morning, indeed, I felt very much inclined to flyinto a passion and box my valet's ears; but on second thoughts Igot quietly up, and on going outside the house was not a littleinterested by the moving illumination which I beheld.</p><p> When old Marheyo received his share of the spoils, immediatepreparations were made for a midnight banquet; calabashes ofpoee-poee were filled to the brim; green bread-fruit wereroasted; and a huge cake of 'amar' was cut up with a sliver ofbamboo and laid out on an immense banana-leaf.</p><p> At this supper we were lighted by several of the native tapers,held in the hands of young girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;These tapers are mostingeniously made.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a nut abounding in the valley, calledby the Typees 'armor', closely resembling our commonhorse-chestnut.&nbsp;&nbsp;The shell is broken, and the contents extractedwhole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any number of these are strung at pleasure upon the longelastic fibre that traverses the branches of the cocoanut tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these tapers are eight or ten feet in length; but beingperfectly flexible, one end is held in a coil, while the other islighted.&nbsp;&nbsp;The nut burns with a fitful bluish flame, and the oilthat it contains is exhausted in about ten minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;As one burnsdown, the next becomes ignited, and the ashes of the former areknocked into a cocoanut shell kept for the purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thisprimitive candle requires continual attention, and must beconstantly held in the hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;The person so employed marks thelapse of time by the number of nuts consumed, which is easilylearned by counting the bits of tappa distributed at regularintervals along the string.</p><p> I grieve to state so distressing a fact, but the inhabitants ofTypee were in the habit of devouring fish much in the same waythat a civilized being would eat a radish, and without any moreprevious preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp;They eat it raw; scales, bones, gills, andall the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish is held by the tail, and the head beingintroduced into the mouth, the animal disappears with a rapiditythat would at first nearly lead one to imagine it had beenlaunched bodily down the throat.</p><p> Raw fish!&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I ever forget my sensations when I first saw myisland beauty devour one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, heavens!&nbsp;&nbsp;Fayaway, how could youever have contracted so vile a habit?&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after the firstshock had subsided, the custom grew less odious in my eyes, and Isoon accustomed myself to the sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let no one imagine,however, that the lovely Fayaway was in the habit of swallowinggreat vulgar-looking fishes: oh, no; with her beautiful smallhand she would clasp a delicate, little, golden-hued love of afish and eat it as elegantly and as innocently as though it werea Naples biscuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;But alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;it was after all a raw fish; andall I can say is, that Fayaway ate it in a more ladylike mannerthan any other girl of the valley.</p><p> When at Rome do as the Romans do, I held to be so good a proverb,that being in Typee I made a point of doing as the Typees did.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I ate poee-poee as they did; I walked about in a garbstriking for its simplicity; and I reposed on a community ofcouches; besides doing many other things in conformity with theirpeculiar habits; but the farthest I ever went in the way ofconformity, was on several occasions to regale myself with rawfish.&nbsp;&nbsp;These being remarkably tender, and quite small, theundertaking was not so disagreeable in the main, and after a fewtrials I positively began to relish them; however, I subjectedthem to a slight operation with a knife previously to making myrepast.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Twenty-nine</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p> NATURAL HISTORY OF THE VALLEY--GOLDEN LIZARDS--TAMENESS OF THEBIRDS--MOSQUITOES--FLIES--DOGS--A SOLITARY CAT--THE CLIMATE--THECOCOANUT TREE--SINGULAR MODES OF CLIMBING IT--AN AGILE YOUNGCHIEF--FEARLESSNESS OF THE CHILDREN--TOO-TOO AND THE COCOANUTTREE--THE BIRDS OF THE VALLEY</p><p> I THINK I must enlighten the reader a little about the naturalhistory of the valley.</p><p> Whence, in the name of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came thosedogs that I saw in Typee?&nbsp;&nbsp;Dogs!--Big hairless rats rather; allwith smooth, shining speckled hides--fat sides, and verydisagreeable faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence could they have come?&nbsp;&nbsp;That they werenot the indigenous production of the region, I am firmlyconvinced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers,looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves insome dark corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was plain enough they did not feel at homein the vale--that they wished themselves well out of it, and backto the ugly country from which they must have come.</p><p> Scurvy curs!&nbsp;&nbsp;they were my abhorrence; I should have likednothing better than to have been the death of every one of them. In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a caninecrusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent toit.&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard me very patiently; but when I had finished, shookhis head, and told me in confidence that they were 'taboo'.</p><p> As for the animal that made the fortune of the ex-lord-mayorWhittington, I shall never forget the day that I was lying in thehouse about noon, everybody else being fast asleep; and happeningto raise my eyes, met those of a big black spectral cat, whichsat erect in the doorway, looking at me with its frightfulgoggling green orbs, like one of those monstrous imps thattorment some of Teniers' saints!&nbsp;&nbsp;I am one of those unfortunatepersons to whom the sight of these animals are, at any time aninsufferable annoyance.</p><p> Thus constitutionally averse to cats in general, the unexpectedapparition of this one in particular utterly confounded me.&nbsp;&nbsp;WhenI had a little recovered from the fascination of its glance, Istarted up; the cat fled, and emboldened by this, I rushed out ofthe house in pursuit; but it had disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the onlytime I ever saw one in the valley, and how it got there I cannotimagine.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just possible that it might have escaped from oneof the ships at Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in vain to seek information onthe subject from the natives, since none of them had seen theanimal, the appearance of which remains a mystery to me to thisday.</p><p> Among the few animals which are to be met with in Typee, therewas none which I looked upon with more interest than a beautifulgolden-hued species of lizard.&nbsp;&nbsp;It measured perhaps five inchesfrom head to tail, and was most gracefully proportioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbersof those creatures were to be seen basking in the sunshine uponthe thatching of the houses, and multitudes at all hours of theday showed their glittering sides as they ran frolicking betweenthe spears of grass or raced in troops up and down the tallshafts of the cocoanut trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the remarkable beauty of theselittle animals and their lively ways were not their only claimsupon my admiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were perfectly tame and insensible tofear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequently, after seating myself upon the ground in someshady place during the heat of the day, I would be completelyoverrun with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I brushed one off my arm, it would leapperhaps into my hair: when I tried to frighten it away by gentlypinching its leg, it would turn for protection to the very handthat attacked it.</p><p> The birds are also remarkably tame.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you happened to see oneperched upon a branch within reach of your arm, and advancedtowards it, it did not fly away immediately, but waited quietlylooking at you, until you could almost touch it, and then tookwing slowly, less alarmed at your presence, it would seem, thandesirous of removing itself from your path.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had salt been lessscarce in the valley than it was, this was the very place to havegone birding with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that once, on an uninhabitedisland of the Gallipagos, a bird alighted on my outstretched arm,while its mate chirped from an adjoining tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its tameness, farfrom shocking me, as a similar occurrence did Selkirk, impartedto me the most exquisite thrill of delight I ever experienced,and with somewhat of the same pleasure did I afterwards beholdthe birds and lizards of the valley show their confidence in thekindliness of man.</p><p> Among the numerous afflictions which the Europeans have entailedupon some of the natives of the South Seas, is the accidentalintroduction among them of that enemy of all repose and rufflerof even tempers--the Mosquito.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Sandwich Islands and attwo or three of the Society group, there are now thrivingcolonies of these insects, who promise ere long to supplantaltogether the aboriginal sand-flies.&nbsp;&nbsp;They sting, buzz, andtorment, from one end of the year to the other, and byincessantly exasperating the natives materially obstruct thebenevolent labours of the missionaries.</p><p> From this grievous visitation, however the Typees are as yetwholly exempt; but its place is unfortunately in some degreesupplied by the occasional presence of a minute species of fly,which, without stinging, is nevertheless productive of no littleannoyance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tameness of the birds and lizards is as nothingwhen compared to the fearless confidence of this insect.&nbsp;&nbsp;He willperch upon one of your eye-lashes, and go to roost there if youdo not disturb him, or force his way through your hair, or alongthe cavity of the nostril, till you almost fancy he is resolvedto explore the very brain itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion I was soinconsiderate as to yawn while a number of them were hoveringaround me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never repeated the act.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some half-dozen dartedinto the open apartment, and began walking about its ceiling; thesensation was dreadful.&nbsp;&nbsp;I involuntarily closed my mouth, and thepoor creatures being enveloped in inner darkness, must in theirconsternation have stumbled over my palate, and been precipitatedinto the gulf beneath.&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate, though I afterwardscharitably held my mouth open for at least five minutes, with aview of affording egress to the stragglers, none of them everavailed themselves of the opportunity.</p><p> There are no wild animals of any kind on the island unless it bedecided that the natives themselves are such.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains andthe interior present to the eye nothing but silent solitudes,unbroken by the roar of beasts of prey, and enlivened by fewtokens even of minute animated existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no venomousreptiles, and no snakes of any description to be found in any ofthe valleys.</p><p> In a company of Marquesan natives the weather affords no topic ofconversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;It can hardly be said to have any vicissitudes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainy season, it is true, brings frequent showers, but theyare intermitting and refreshing.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an islander bound on someexpedition rises from his couch in the morning, he is neversolicitous to peep out and see how the sky looks, or ascertainfrom what quarter the wind blows.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is always sure of a 'fineday', and the promise of a few genial showers he hails withpleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is never any of that 'remarkable weather' on theislands which from time immemorial has been experienced inAmerica, and still continues to call forth the wonderingconversational exclamations of its elderly citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor dothere even occur any of those eccentric meteorological changeswhich elsewhere surprise us.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley of Typee ice-creamswould never be rendered less acceptable by sudden frosts, norwould picnic parties be deferred on account of inauspicioussnowstorms: for there day follows day in one unvarying round ofsummer and sunshine, and the whole year is one long tropicalmonth of June just melting into July.</p><p> It is this genial climate which causes the cocoanuts to flourishas they do.&nbsp;&nbsp;This invaluable fruit, brought to perfection by therich soil of the Marquesas, and home aloft on a stately columnmore than a hundred feet from the ground, would seem at firstalmost inaccessible to the simple natives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed the slender,smooth, and soaring shaft, without a single limb or protuberanceof any kind to assist one in mounting it, presents an obstacleonly to be overcome by the surprising agility and ingenuity ofthe islanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be supposed that their indolence wouldlead them patiently to await the period when the ripened nuts,slowly parting from their stems, fall one by one to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;This certainly would be the case, were it not that the youngfruit, encased in a soft green husk, with the incipient meatadhering in a jelly-like pellicle to its sides, and containing abumper of the most delicious nectar, is what they chiefly prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have at least twenty different terms to express as manyprogressive stages in the growth of the nut.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of them rejectthe fruit altogether except at a particular period of its growth,which, incredible as it may appear, they seemed to me to be ableto ascertain within an hour or two.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are still morecapricious in their tastes; and after gathering together a heapof the nuts of all ages, and ingeniously tapping them, will firstsip from one and then from another, as fastidiously as somedelicate wine-bibber experimenting glass in hand among his dustydemi-johns of different vintages.</p><p> Some of the young men, with more flexible frames than theircomrades, and perhaps with more courageous souls, bad a way ofwalking up the trunk of the cocoanut trees which to me seemedlittle less than miraculous; and when looking at them in the act,I experienced that curious perplexity a child feels when hebeholds a fly moving feet uppermost along a ceiling.</p><p> I will endeavour to describe the way in which Narnee, a nobleyoung chief, sometimes performed this feat for my peculiargratification; but his preliminary performances must also berecorded.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my signifying my desire that he should pluck methe young fruit of some particular tree, the handsome savage,throwing himself into a sudden attitude of surprise, feignsastonishment at the apparent absurdity of the request.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining this position for a moment, the strange emotionsdepicted on his countenance soften down into one of humorousresignation to my will, and then looking wistfully up to thetufted top of the tree, he stands on tip-toe, straining his neckand elevating his arm, as though endeavouring to reach the fruitfrom the ground where he stands.&nbsp;&nbsp;As if defeated in this childishattempt, he now sinks to the earth despondingly, beating hisbreast in well-acted despair; and then, starting to his feet allat once, and throwing back his head, raises both hands, like aschool-boy about to catch a falling ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;After continuing thisfor a moment or two, as if in expectation that the fruit wasgoing to be tossed down to him by some good spirit in thetree-top, he turns wildly round in another fit of despair, andscampers off to the distance of thirty or forty yards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here heremains awhile, eyeing the tree, the very picture of misery; butthe next moment, receiving, as it were, a flash of inspiration,he rushes again towards it, and clasping both arms about thetrunk, with one elevated a little above the other, he presses thesoles of his feet close together against the tree, extending hislegs from it until they are nearly horizontal, and his bodybecomes doubled into an arch; then, hand over hand and foot overfoot, he rises from the earth with steady rapidity, and almostbefore you are aware of it, has gained the cradled and embowerednest of nuts, and with boisterous glee flings the fruit to theground.</p><p> This mode of walking the tree is only practicable where the trunkdeclines considerably from the perpendicular.&nbsp;&nbsp;This, however, isalmost always the case; some of the perfectly straight shafts ofthe trees leaning at an angle of thirty degrees.</p><p> The less active among the men, and many of the children of thevalley have another method of climbing.&nbsp;&nbsp;They take a broad andstout piece of bark, and secure each end of it to their ankles,so that when the feet thus confined are extended apart, a spaceof little more than twelve inches is left between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thiscontrivance greatly facilitates the act of climbing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bandpressed against the tree, and closely embracing it, yields apretty firm support; while with the arms clasped about the trunk,and at regular intervals sustaining the body, the feet are drawnup nearly a yard at a time, and a corresponding elevation of thehands immediately succeeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way I have seen littlechildren, scarcely five years of age, fearlessly climbing theslender pole of a young cocoanut tree, and while hanging perhapsfifty feet from the ground, receiving the plaudits of theirparents beneath, who clapped their hands, and encouraged them tomount still higher.</p><p> What, thought I, on first witnessing one of these exhibitions,would the nervous mothers of America and England say to a similardisplay of hardihood in any of their children?&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lacedemoniannation might have approved of it, but most modern dames wouldhave gone into hysterics at the sight.</p><p> At the top of the cocoanut tree the numerous branches, radiatingon all sides from a common centre, form a sort of green andwaving basket, between the leaflets of which you just discern thenuts thickly clustering together, and on the loftier treeslooking no bigger from the ground than bunches of grapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iremember one adventurous little fellow--Too-Too was the rascal'sname--who had built himself a sort of aerial baby-house in thepicturesque tuft of a tree adjoining Marheyo's habitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heused to spend hours there,--rustling among the branches, andshouting with delight every time the strong gusts of wind rushingdown from the mountain side, swayed to and fro the tall andflexible column on which he was perched.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I heardToo-Too's musical voice sounding strangely to the ear from sogreat a height, and beheld him peeping down upon me from out hisleafy covert, he always recalled to my mind Dibdin's lines--&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> 'There's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft,&nbsp;&nbsp;To look outfor the life of poor Jack.'</p><p> Birds--bright and beautiful birds--fly over the valley of Typee.&nbsp;&nbsp;You see them perched aloft among the immovable boughs of themajestic bread-fruit trees, or gently swaying on the elasticbranches of the Omoo; skimming over the palmetto thatching of thebamboo huts; passing like spirits on the wing through the shadowsof the grove, and sometimes descending into the bosom of thevalley in gleaming flights from the mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their plumage ispurple and azure, crimson and white, black and gold; with billsof every tint: bright bloody red, jet black, and ivory white, andtheir eyes are bright and sparkling; they go sailing through theair in starry throngs; but, alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;the spell of dumbness is uponthem all--there is not a single warbler in the valley!</p><p> I know not why it was, but the sight of these birds, generallythe ministers of gladness, always oppressed me with melancholy.&nbsp;&nbsp;As in their dumb beauty they hovered by me whilst I was walking,or looked down upon me with steady curious eyes from out thefoliage, I was almost inclined to fancy that they knew they weregazing upon a stranger, and that they commiserated his fate.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Thirty</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p> A PROFESSOR OF THE FINE ARTS--HIS PERSECUTIONS--SOMETHING ABOUTTATTOOING AND TABOOING--TWO ANECDOTES IN ILLUSTRATION OF THELATTER--A FEW THOUGHTS ON THE TYPEE DIALECT</p><p> IN one of my strolls with Kory-Kory, in passing along the borderof a thick growth of bushes, my attention was arrested by asingular noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;On entering the thicket I witnessed for thefirst time the operation of tattooing as performed by theseislanders.</p><p> I beheld a man extended flat upon his back on the ground, and,despite the forced composure of his countenance, it was evidentthat he was suffering agony.&nbsp;&nbsp;His tormentor bent over him,working away for all the world like a stone-cutter with malletand chisel.&nbsp;&nbsp;In one hand he held a short slender stick, pointedwith a shark's tooth, on the upright end of which he tapped witha small hammer-like piece of wood, thus puncturing the skin, andcharging it with the colouring matter in which the instrument wasdipped.&nbsp;&nbsp;A cocoanut shell containing this fluid was placed uponthe ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is prepared by mixing with a vegetable juice theashes of the 'armor', or candle-nut, always preserved for thepurpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the savage, and spread out upon a piece ofsoiled tappa, were a great number of curious black-looking littleimplements of bone and wood, used in the various divisions of hisart.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few terminated in a single fine point, and, like verydelicate pencils, were employed in giving the finishing touches,or in operating upon the more sensitive portions of the body, aswas the case in the present instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others presented severalpoints distributed in a line, somewhat resembling the teeth of asaw.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were employed in the coarser parts of the work, andparticularly in pricking in straight marks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some presented theirpoints disposed in small figures, and being placed upon the body,were, by a single blow of the hammer, made to leave theirindelible impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;I observed a few the handles of which weremysteriously curved, as if intended to be introduced into theorifice of the ear, with a view perhaps of beating the tattooupon the tympanum.&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether the sight of these strangeinstruments recalled to mind that display of cruel-lookingmother-of-pearl-handled things which one sees in theirvelvet-lined cases at the elbow of a dentist.</p><p> The artist was not at this time engaged on an original sketch,his subject being a venerable savage, whose tattooing had becomesomewhat faded with age and needed a few repairs, and accordinglyhe was merely employed in touching up the works of some of theold masters of the Typee school, as delineated upon the humancanvas before him.&nbsp;&nbsp;The parts operated upon were the eyelids,where a longitudinal streak, like the one which adornedKory-Kory, crossed the countenance of the victim.</p><p> In spite of all the efforts of the poor old man, sundrytwitchings and screwings of the muscles of the face denoted theexquisite sensibility of these shutters to the windows of hissoul, which he was now having repainted.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the artist, with aheart as callous as that of an army surgeon, continued hisperformance, enlivening his labours with a wild chant, tappingaway the while as merrily as a woodpecker.</p><p> So deeply engaged was he in his work, that he had not observedour approach, until, after having, enjoyed an unmolested view ofthe operation, I chose to attract his attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as heperceived me, supposing that I sought him in his professionalcapacity, he seized hold of me in a paroxysm of delight, and wasan eagerness to begin the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;When, however, I gave him tounderstand that he had altogether mistaken my views, nothingcould exceed his grief and disappointment.&nbsp;&nbsp;But recovering fromthis, he seemed determined not to discredit my assertion, andgrasping his implements, he flourished them about in fearfulvicinity to my face, going through an imaginary performance ofhis art, and every moment bursting into some admiring exclamationat the beauty of his designs.</p><p> Horrified at the bare thought of being rendered hideous for lifeif the wretch were to execute his purpose upon me, I struggled toget away from him, while Kory-Kory, turning traitor, stood by,and besought me to comply with the outrageous request.&nbsp;&nbsp;On myreiterated refusals the excited artist got half beside himself,and was overwhelmed with sorrow at losing so noble an opportunityof distinguishing himself in his profession.</p><p> The idea of engrafting his tattooing upon my white skin filledhim with all a painter's enthusiasm; again and again he gazedinto my countenance, and every fresh glimpse seemed to add to thevehemence of his ambition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not knowing to what extremities hemight proceed, and shuddering at the ruin he might inflict uponmy figure-head, I now endeavoured to draw off his attention fromit, and holding out my arm in a fit of desperation, signed to himto commence operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;But he rejected the compromiseindignantly, and still continued his attack on my face, as thoughnothing short of that would satisfy him.&nbsp;&nbsp;When his forefingerswept across my features, in laying out the borders of thoseparallel bands which were to encircle my countenance, the fleshfairly crawled upon my bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, half wild with terror andindignation, I succeeded in breaking away from the three savages,and fled towards old Marheyo's house, pursued by the indomitableartist, who ran after me, implements in hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kory-Kory,however, at last interfered and drew him off from the chase.</p><p> This incident opened my eyes to a new danger; and I now feltconvinced that in some luckless hour I should be disfigured insuch a manner as never more to have the FACE to return to mycountrymen, even should an opportunity offer.</p><p> These apprehensions were greatly increased by the desire whichKing Mehevi and several of the inferior chiefs now manifestedthat I should be tattooed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasure of the king was firstsignified to me some three days after my casual encounter withKarky the artist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavens!&nbsp;&nbsp;what imprecations I showered uponthat Karky.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubtless he had plotted a conspiracy against me andmy countenance, and would never rest until his diabolical purposewas accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several times I met him in various parts ofthe valley, and, invariably, whenever he descried me, he camerunning after me with his mallet and chisel, flourishing themabout my face as if he longed to begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;What an object he wouldhave made of me!</p><p> When the king first expressed his wish to me, I made known to himmy utter abhorrence of the measure, and worked myself into such astate of excitement, that he absolutely stared at me inamazement.&nbsp;&nbsp;It evidently surpassed his majesty's comprehensionhow any sober-minded and sensible individual could entertain theleast possible objection to so beautifying an operation.</p><p> Soon afterwards he repeated his suggestion, and meeting with alittle repulse, showed some symptoms of displeasure at myobduracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;On his a third time renewing his request, I plainlyperceived that something must be done, or my visage was ruinedfor ever; I therefore screwed up my courage to the stickingpoint, and declared my willingness to have both arms tattooedfrom just above the wrist to the shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;His majesty wasgreatly pleased at the proposition, and I was congratulatingmyself with having thus compromised the matter, when he intimatedthat as a thing of course my face was first to undergo theoperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was fairly driven to despair; nothing but the utterruin of my 'face divine', as the poets call it, would, Iperceived, satisfy the inexorable Mehevi and his chiefs, orrather, that infernal Karky, for he was at the bottom of it all.</p><p> The only consolation afforded me was a choice of patterns: I wasat perfect liberty to have my face spanned by three horizontalbars, after the fashion of my serving-man's; or to have as manyoblique stripes slanting across it; or if, like a true courtier,I chose to model my style on that of royalty, I might wear a sortof freemason badge upon my countenance in the shape of a mystictriangle.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would have none of these, though the kingmost earnestly impressed upon my mind that my choice was whollyunrestricted.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, seeing my unconquerable repugnance, heceased to importune me.</p><p> But not so some other of the savages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly a day passed but Iwas subjected to their annoying requests, until at last myexistence became a burden to me; the pleasures I had previouslyenjoyed no longer afforded me delight, and all my former desireto escape from the valley now revived with additional force.</p><p> A fact which I soon afterwards learned augmented my apprehension.The whole system of tattooing was, I found, connected with theirreligion; and it was evident, therefore, that they were resolvedto make a convert of me.</p><p> In the decoration of the chiefs it seems to be necessary toexercise the most elaborate pencilling; while some of theinferior natives looked as if they had been daubed overindiscriminately with a house-painter's brush.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember onefellow who prided himself hugely upon a great oblong patch,placed high upon his back, and who always reminded me of a manwith a blister of Spanish flies, stuck between his shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another whom I frequently met had the hollow of his eyes tattooedin two regular squares and his visual organs being remarkablybrilliant, they gleamed forth from out this setting like a coupleof diamonds inserted in ebony.</p><p> Although convinced that tattooing was a religious observance,still the nature of the connection between it and thesuperstitious idolatry of the people was a point upon which Icould never obtain any information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the still moreimportant system of the 'Taboo', it always appeared inexplicableto me.</p><p> There is a marked similarity, almost an identity, between thereligious institutions of most of the Polynesian islands, and inall exists the mysterious 'Taboo', restricted in its uses to agreater or less extent.&nbsp;&nbsp;So strange and complex in itsarrangements is this remarkable system, that I have in severalcases met with individuals who, after residing for years amongthe islands in the Pacific, and acquiring a considerableknowledge of the language, have nevertheless been altogetherunable to give any satisfactory account of its operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Situated as I was in the Typee valley, I perceived every hour theeffects of this all-controlling power, without in the leastcomprehending it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those effects were, indeed, wide-spread anduniversal, pervading the most important as well as the minutesttransactions of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage, in short, lives in thecontinual observance of its dictates, which guide and controlevery action of his being.</p><p> For several days after entering the valley I had been saluted atleast fifty times in the twenty-four hours with the talismanicword 'Taboo' shrieked in my ears, at some gross violation of itsprovisions, of which I had unconsciously been guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dayafter our arrival I happened to hand some tobacco to Toby overthe head of a native who sat between us.&nbsp;&nbsp;He started up, as ifstung by an adder; while the whole company, manifesting an equaldegree of horror, simultaneously screamed out 'Taboo!'&nbsp;&nbsp;I neveragain perpetrated a similar piece of ill-manners, which, indeed,was forbidden by the canons of good breeding, as well as by themandates of the taboo.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was not always so easy to perceivewherein you had contravened the spirit of this institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iwas many times called to order, if I may use the phrase, when Icould not for the life of me conjecture what particular offence Ihad committed.</p><p> One day I was strolling through a secluded portion of the valley,and hearing the musical sound of the cloth-mallet at a littledistance, I turned down a path that conducted me in a few momentsto a house where there were some half-dozen girls employed inmaking tappa.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an operation I had frequently witnessed,and had handled the bark in all the various stages of itspreparation.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the present occasion the females were intentupon their occupation, and after looking up and talking gaily tome for a few moments, they resumed their employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;I regardedthem for a while in silence, and then carelessly picking up ahandful of the material that lay around, proceeded unconsciouslyto pick it apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;While thus engaged, I was suddenly startled bya scream, like that of a whole boarding-school of young ladiesjust on the point of going into hysterics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaping up with theidea of seeing a score of Happar warriors about to perform anewthe Sabine atrocity, I found myself confronted by the company ofgirls, who, having dropped their work, stood before me withstarting eyes, swelling bosoms, and fingers pointed in horrortowards me.</p><p> Thinking that some venomous reptile must be concealed in the barkwhich I held in my hand, I began cautiously to separate andexamine it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I did so the horrified girls re-doubled theirshrieks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wild cries and frightened motions actuallyalarmed me, and throwing down the tappa, I was about to rush fromthe house, when in the same instant their clamours ceased, andone of them, seizing me by the arm, pointed to the broken fibresthat had just fallen from my grasp, and screamed in my ears thefatal word Taboo!</p><p> I subsequently found out that the fabric they were engaged inmaking was of a peculiar kind, destined to be worn on the headsof the females, and through every stage of its manufacture wasguarded by a rigorous taboo, which interdicted the wholemasculine gender from even so much as touching it.</p><p> Frequently in walking through the groves I observed bread-fruitand cocoanut trees, with a wreath of leaves twined in a peculiarfashion about their trunks.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the mark of the taboo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thetrees themselves, their fruit, and even the shadows they castupon the ground, were consecrated by its presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sameway a pipe, which the king had bestowed upon me, was renderedsacred in the eyes of the natives, none of whom could I everprevail upon to smoke from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bowl was encircled by a wovenband of grass, somewhat resembling those Turks' headsoccasionally worked in the handles of our whip-stalks,</p><p> A similar badge was once braided about my wrist by the royal handof Mehevi himself, who, as soon as he had concluded theoperation, pronounced me 'Taboo'.&nbsp;&nbsp;This occurred shortly afterToby's disappearance; and, were it not that from the first momentI had entered the valley the natives had treated me with uniformkindness, I should have supposed that their conduct afterwardswas to be ascribed to the fact that I had received this sacredinvestiture.</p><p> The capricious, operations of the taboo are not its leastremarkable feature: to enumerate them all would be impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Black hogs--infants to a certain age--women in an interestingsituation--young men while the operation of tattooing their facesis going on--and certain parts of the valley during thecontinuance of a shower--are alike fenced about by the operationof the taboo.</p><p> I witnessed a striking instance of its effects in the bay ofTior, my visit to which place has been alluded to in a formerpart of this narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;On that occasion our worthy captainformed one of the party.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a most insatiable sportsman.&nbsp;&nbsp;Outward bound, and off the pitch of Cape Horn, he used to sit onthe taffrail, and keep the steward loading three or four oldfowling pieces, with which he would bring down albatrosses, Capepigeons, jays, petrels, and divers other marine fowl, whofollowed chattering in our wake.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors were struck aghastat his impiety, and one and all attributed our forty days'beating about that horrid headland to his sacrilegious slaughterof these inoffensive birds.</p><p> At Tior he evinced the same disregard for the religiousprejudices of the islanders, as he had previously shown for thesuperstitions of the sailors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard that there were aconsiderable number of fowls in the valley the progeny of somecocks and hens accidentally left there by an English vessel, andwhich, being strictly tabooed, flew about almost in a wildstate--he determined to break through all restraints, and be thedeath of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, he provided himself with a mostformidable looking gun, and announced his landing on the beach byshooting down a noble cock that was crowing what proved to be hisown funeral dirge, on the limb of an adjoining tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Taboo',shrieked the affrighted savages.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Oh, hang your taboo,' says thenautical sportsman; 'talk taboo to the marines'; and bang wentthe piece again, and down came another victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this thenatives ran scampering through the groves, horror-struck at theenormity of the act.</p><p> All that afternoon the rocky sides of the valley rang withsuccessive reports, and the superb plumage of many a beautifulfowl was ruffled by the fatal bullet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had it not been that theFrench admiral, with a large party, was then in the glen, I haveno doubt that the natives, although their tribe was small anddispirited, would have inflicted summary vengeance upon the manwho thus outraged their most sacred institutions; as it was, theycontrived to annoy him not a little.</p><p> Thirsting with his exertions, the skipper directed his steps to astream; but the savages, who had followed at a little distance,perceiving his object, rushed towards him and forced him awayfrom its bank--his lips would have polluted it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearied at last,he sought to enter a house that he might rest for a while on themats; its inmates gathered tumultuously about the door and deniedhim admittance.&nbsp;&nbsp;He coaxed and blustered by turns, but in vain;the natives were neither to be intimidated nor appeased, and as afinal resort he was obliged to call together his boat's crew, andpull away from what he termed the most infernal place he everstepped upon.</p><p> Lucky was it for him and for us that we were not honoured on ourdeparture by a salute of stones from the hands of the exasperatedTiors.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, on the neighbouring island of Ropo, werekilled, but a few weeks previously, and for a nearly similaroffence, the master and three of the crew of the K---.</p><p> I cannot determine with anything approaching to certainty, whatpower it is that imposes the taboo.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I consider the slightdisparity of condition among the islanders--the very limited andinconsiderable prerogatives of the king and chiefs--and the looseand indefinite functions of the priesthood, most of whom werehardly to be distinguished from the rest of their countrymen, Iam wholly at a loss where to look for the authority whichregulates this potent institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imposed upon somethingtoday, and withdrawn tomorrow; while its operations in othercases are perpetual.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes its restrictions only affect asingle individual--sometimes a particular family--sometimes awhole tribe; and in a few instances they extend not merely overthe various clans on a single island, but over all theinhabitants of an entire group.&nbsp;&nbsp;In illustration of this latterpeculiarity, I may cite the law which forbids a female to enter acanoe--a prohibition which prevails upon all the northernMarquesas Islands.</p><p> The word itself (taboo) is used in more than one signification.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sometimes used by a parent to his child, when in theexercise of parental authority he forbids it to perform aparticular action.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything opposed to the ordinary customs ofthe islanders, although not expressly prohibited, is said to be'taboo'.</p><p> The Typee language is one very difficult to be acquired; it bearsa close resemblance to the other Polynesian dialects, all ofwhich show a common origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The duplication of words, as 'lumeelumee', 'poee poee', 'muee muee', is one of their peculiarfeatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;But another, and a more annoying one, is the differentsenses in which one and the same word is employed; its variousmeanings all have a certain connection, which only makes thematter more puzzling.&nbsp;&nbsp;So one brisk, lively little word isobliged, like a servant in a poor family, to perform all sorts ofduties; for instance, one particular combination of syllablesexpresses the ideas of sleep, rest, reclining, sitting, leaning,and all other things anywise analogous thereto, the particularmeaning being shown chiefly by a variety of gestures and theeloquent expression of the countenance.</p><p> The intricacy of these dialects is another peculiarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;In theMissionary College at Lahainaluna, on Mowee, one of the SandwichIslands, I saw a tabular exhibition of a Hawiian verb, conjugatedthrough all its moods and tenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;It covered the side of aconsiderable apartment, and I doubt whether Sir William Joneshimself would not have despaired of mastering it.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Thirty-one</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER THIRTY-ONESTRANGE CUSTOM OF THE ISLANDERS--THEIR CHANTING, AND THEPECULIARITY OF THEIR VOICE--RAPTURE OF THE KING AT FIRST HEARINGA SONG--A NEW DIGNITY CONFERRED ON THE AUTHOR--MUSICALINSTRUMENTS IN THE VALLEY--ADMIRATION OF THE SAVAGES AT BEHOLDINGA PUGILISTIC PERFORMANCE--SWIMMING INFANT--BEAUTIFUL TRESSES OFTHE GIRLS--OINTMENT FOR THE HAIRSADLY discursive as I have already been, I must still furtherentreat the reader's patience, as I am about to string together,without any attempt at order, a few odds and ends of things nothitherto mentioned, but which are either curious in themselves orpeculiar to the Typees.There was one singular custom observed in old Marheyo's domesticestablishment, which often excited my surprise. Every night,before retiring, the inmates of the house gathered together onthe mats, and so squatting upon their haunches, after theuniversal practice of these islanders, would commence a low,dismal and monotonous chant, accompanying the voice with theinstrumental melody produced by two small half-rotten stickstapped slowly together, a pair of which were held in the hands ofeach person present. Thus would they employ themselves for anhour or two, sometimes longer. Lying in the gloom which wrappedthe further end of the house, I could not avoid looking at them,although the spectacle suggested nothing but unpleasantreflection. The flickering rays of the 'armor' nut just servedto reveal their savage lineaments, without dispelling thedarkness that hovered about them.Sometimes when, after falling into a kind of doze, and awakingsuddenly in the midst of these doleful chantings, my eye wouldfall upon the wild-looking group engaged in their strangeoccupation, with their naked tattooed limbs, and shaven headsdisposed in a circle, I was almost tempted to believe that Igazed upon a set of evil beings in the act of working at afrightful incantation.What was the meaning or purpose of this custom, whether it waspracticed merely as a diversion, or whether it was a religiousexercise, a sort of family prayers, I never could discover.The sounds produced by the natives on these occasions were of amost singular description; and had I not actually been present, Inever would have believed that such curious noises could havebeen produced by human beings.To savages generally is imputed a guttural articulation. Thishowever, is not always the case, especially among the inhabitantsof the Polynesian Archipelago. The labial melody with which theTypee girls carry on an ordinary conversation, giving a musicalprolongation to the final syllable of every sentence, andchirping out some of the words with a liquid, bird-like accent,was singularly pleasing.The men however, are not quite so harmonious in their utterance,and when excited upon any subject, would work themselves up intoa sort of wordy paroxysm, during which all descriptions ofrough-sided sounds were projected from their mouths, with a forceand rapidity which was absolutely astonishing. . . . . . . . .Although these savages are remarkably fond of chanting, stillthey appear to have no idea whatever of singing, at least as theart is practised in other nations.I shall never forget the first time I happened to roar out astave in the presence of noble Mehevi. It was a stanza from the'Bavarian broom-seller'. His Typeean majesty, with all hiscourt, gazed upon me in amazement, as if I had displayed somepreternatural faculty which Heaven had denied to them. The Kingwas delighted with the verse; but the chorus fairly transportedhim. At his solicitation I sang it again and again, and nothingcould be more ludicrous than his vain attempts to catch the airand the words. The royal savage seemed to think that by screwingall the features of his face into the end of his nose he mightpossibly succeed in the undertaking, but it failed to answer thepurpose; and in the end he gave it up, and consoled himself bylistening to my repetition of the sounds fifty times over.Previous to Mehevi's making the discovery, I had never been awarethat there was anything of the nightingale about me; but I wasnow promoted to the place of court-minstrel, in which capacity Iwas afterwards perpetually called upon to officiate. . . . . . . . .Besides the sticks and the drums, there are no other musicalinstruments among the Typees, except one which mightappropriately be denominated a nasal flute. It is somewhatlonger than an ordinary fife; is made of a beautifulscarlet-coloured reed; and has four or five stops, with a largehole near one end, which latter is held just beneath the leftnostril. The other nostril being closed by a peculiar movementof the muscles about the nose, the breath is forced into thetube, and produces a soft dulcet sound which is varied by thefingers running at random over the stops. This is a favouriterecreation with the females and one in which Fayaway greatlyexcelled. Awkward as such an instrument may appear, it was, inFayaway's delicate little hands, one of the most graceful I haveever seen. A young lady, in the act of tormenting a guitarstrung about her neck by a couple of yards of blue ribbon, is nothalf so engaging. . . . . . . . .Singing was not the only means I possessed of diverting the royalMehevi and his easy-going subject. Nothing afforded them morepleasure than to see me go through the attitude of pugilisticencounter. As not one of the natives had soul enough in him tostand up like a man, and allow me to hammer away at him, for myown personal gratification and that of the king, I wasnecessitated to fight with an imaginary enemy, whom I invariablymade to knock under to my superior prowess. Sometimes when thissorely battered shadow retreated precipitately towards a group ofthe savages, and, following him up, I rushed among them dealingmy blows right and left, they would disperse in all directionsmuch to the enjoyment of Mehevi, the chiefs, and themselves.The noble art of self-defence appeared to be regarded by them asthe peculiar gift of the white man; and I make little doubt thatthey supposed armies of Europeans were drawn up provided withnothing else but bony fists and stout hearts, with which they setto in column, and pummelled one another at the word of command. . . . . . . . .One day, in company with Kory-Kory, I had repaired to the streamfor the purpose of bathing, when I observed a woman sitting upona rock in the midst of the current, and watching with theliveliest interest the gambols of something, which at first Itook to be an uncommonly large species of frog that was sportingin the water near her. Attracted by the novelty of the sight, Iwaded towards the spot where she sat, and could hardly credit theevidence of my senses when I beheld a little infant, the periodof whose birth could not have extended back many days, paddlingabout as if it had just risen to the surface, after being hatchedinto existence at the bottom. Occasionally, the delighted parentreached out her hand towards it, when the little thing, utteringa faint cry, and striking out its tiny limbs, would sidle for therock, and the next moment be clasped to its mother's bosom. Thiswas repeated again and again, the baby remaining in the streamabout a minute at a time. Once or twice it made wry faces atswallowing a mouthful of water, and choked a spluttered as if onthe point of strangling. At such times however, the mothersnatched it up and by a process scarcely to be mentioned obligedit to eject the fluid. For several weeks afterwards I observedthis woman bringing her child down to the stream regularly everyday, in the cool of the morning and evening and treating it to abath. No wonder that the South Sea Islanders are so amphibious arace, when they are thus launched into the water as soon as theysee the light. I am convinced that it is as natural for a humanbeing to swim as it is for a duck. And yet in civilizedcommunities how many able-bodied individuals die, like so manydrowning kittens, from the occurrence of the most trivialaccidents! . . . . . . . .The long luxuriant and glossy tresses of the Typee damsels oftenattracted my admiration. A fine head of hair is the pride andjoy of every woman's heart. Whether against the express will ofProvidence, it is twisted upon the crown of the head and therecoiled away like a rope on a ship's deck; whether it be stuckbehind the ears and hangs down like the swag of a smallwindow-curtain; or whether it be permitted to flow over theshoulders in natural ringlets, it is always the pride of theowner, and the glory of the toilette.The Typee girls devote much of their time to the dressing oftheir fair and redundant locks. After bathing, as they sometimesdo five or six times every day, the hair is carefully dried, andif they have been in the sea, invariably washed in fresh water,and anointed with a highly scented oil extracted from the meat ofthe cocoanut. This oil is obtained in great abundance by thefollowing very simple process:A large vessel of wood, with holes perforated in the bottom, isfilled with the pounded meat, and exposed to the rays of the sun. As the oleaginous matter exudes, it falls in drops through theapertures into a wide-mouthed calabash placed underneath. Aftera sufficient quantity has thus been collected, the oil undergoesa purifying process, and is then poured into the small sphericalshells of the nuts of the moo-tree, which are hollowed out toreceive it. These nuts are then hermetically sealed with aresinous gum, and the vegetable fragrance of their green rindsoon imparts to the oil a delightful odour. After the lapse of afew weeks the exterior shell of the nuts becomes quite dry andhard, and assumes a beautiful carnation tint; and when openedthey are found to be about two-thirds full of an ointment of alight yellow colour and diffusing the sweetest perfume. Thiselegant little odorous globe would not be out of place even uponthe toilette of a queen. Its merits as a preparation for the hairare undeniable--it imparts to it a superb gloss and a silkyfineness. </p><h2>Chapter Thirty-two</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p> APPREHENSIONS OF EVIL-- FRIGHTFUL DISCOVERY--SOME REMARKS ONCANNIBALISM--SECOND BATTLE WITH THE HAPPARS--SAVAGESPECTACLE--MYSTERIOUS FEAST--SUBSEQUENT DISCLOSURES</p><p> FROM the time of my casual encounter with Karky the artist, mylife was one of absolute wretchedness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a day passed but Iwas persecuted by the solicitations of some of the natives tosubject myself to the odious operation of tattooing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirimportunities drove me half wild, for I felt how easily theymight work their will upon me regarding this or anything elsewhich they took into their heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, however, the behaviourof the islanders towards me was as kind as ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fayaway wasquite as engaging; Kory-Kory as devoted; and Mehevi the king justas gracious and condescending as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I had now beenthree months in their valley, as nearly as I could estimate; Ihad grown familiar with the narrow limits to which my wanderinghad been confined; and I began bitterly to feel the state ofcaptivity in which I was held.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no one with whom Icould freely converse; no one to whom I could communicate mythoughts; no one who could sympathize with my sufferings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Athousand times I thought how much more endurable would have beenmy lot had Toby still been with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was left alone, andthe thought was terrible to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, despite my griefs, I didall in my power to appear composed and cheerful, well knowingthat by manifesting any uneasiness, or any desire to escape, Ishould only frustrate my object.</p><p> It was during the period I was in this unhappy frame of mind thatthe painful malady under which I had been labouring--after havingalmost completely subsided--began again to show itself, and withsymptoms as violent as ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;This added calamity nearly unmannedme; the recurrence of the complaint proved that without powerfulremedial applications all hope of cure was futile; and when Ireflected that just beyond the elevations, which bound me in, wasthe medical relief I needed, and that although so near, it wasimpossible for me to avail myself of it, the thought was misery.</p><p> In this wretched situation, every circumstance which evinced thesavage nature of the beings at whose mercy I was, augmented thefearful apprehensions that consumed me.&nbsp;&nbsp;An occurrence whichhappened about this time affected me most powerfully.</p><p> I have already mentioned that from the ridge-pole of Marheyo'shouse were suspended a number of packages enveloped in tappa.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these I had often seen in the hands of the natives, andtheir contents had been examined in my presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there werethree packages hanging very nearly over the place where I lay,which from their remarkable appearance had often excited mycuriousity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several times I had asked Kory-Kory to show me theircontents, but my servitor, who, in almost every other particularhad acceded to my wishes, refused to gratify me in this.</p><p> One day, returning unexpectedly from the 'Ti', my arrival seemedto throw the inmates of the house into the greatest confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were seated together on the mats, and by the lines whichextended from the roof to the floor I immediately perceived thatthe mysterious packages were for some purpose or another underinspection.&nbsp;&nbsp;The evident alarm the savages betrayed filled mewith forebodings of evil, and with an uncontrollable desire topenetrate the secret so jealously guarded Despite the efforts ofMarheyo and Kory-Kory to restrain me, I forced my way into themidst of the circle, and just caught a glimpse of three humanheads, which others of the party were hurriedly enveloping in thecoverings from which they had been taken.</p><p> One of the three I distinctly saw.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in a state of perfectpreservation, and from the slight glimpse I had of it, seemed tohave been subjected to some smoking operation which had reducedit to the dry, hard, and mummy-like appearance it presented.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thetwo long scalp locks were twisted up into balls upon the crown ofthe head in the same way that the individual had worn them duringfife.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunken cheeks were rendered yet more ghastly by therows of glistening teeth which protruded from between the lips,while the sockets of the eyes--filled with oval bits ofmother-of-pearl shell, with a black spot in thecentre--heightened the hideousness of its aspect.</p><p> Two of the three were heads of the islanders; but the third, tomy horror, was that of a white man.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it had been quicklyremoved from my sight, still the glimpse I had of it was enoughto convince me that I could not be mistaken.</p><p> Gracious God!&nbsp;&nbsp;what dreadful thoughts entered my head; in solvingthis mystery perhaps I had solved another, and the fate of mylost companion might be revealed in the shocking spectacle I hadjust witnessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I longed to have torn off the folds of cloth andsatisfied the awful doubts under which I laboured.&nbsp;&nbsp;But before Ihad recovered from the consternation into which I had beenthrown, the fatal packages were hoisted aloft, and once moreswung over my head.&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives now gathered round metumultuously, and laboured to convince me that what I had justseen were the heads of three Happar warriors, who had been slainin battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;This glaring falsehood added to my alarm, and it wasnot until I reflected that I had observed the packages swingingfrom their elevation before Toby's disappearance, that I could atall recover my composure.</p><p> But although this horrible apprehension had been dispelled, I haddiscovered enough to fill me, in my present state of mind, withthe most bitter reflections.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was plain that I had seen thelast relic of some unfortunate wretch, who must have beenmassacred on the beach by the savages, in one of those periloustrading adventures which I have before described.</p><p> It was not, however, alone the murder of the stranger thatovercame me with gloom.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shuddered at the idea of thesubsequent fate his inanimate body might have met with Was thesame doom reserved for me?&nbsp;&nbsp;Was I destined to perish like him-like him perhaps, to be devoured and my head to be preserved as afearful memento of the events?&nbsp;&nbsp;My imagination ran riot in thesehorrid speculations, and I felt certain that the worst possibleevils would befall me.&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever were my misgivings, Istudiously concealed them from the islanders, as well as the fullextent of the discovery I had made.</p><p> Although the assurances which the Typees had often given me, thatthey never eat human flesh, had not convinced me that such wasthe case, yet, having been so long a time in the valley withoutwitnessing anything which indicated the existence of thepractice, I began to hope that it was an event of very rareoccurrence, and that I should be spared the horror of witnessingit during my stay among them: but, alas, these hopes were soondestroyed.</p><p> It is a singular fact, that in all our accounts of cannibaltribes we have seldom received the testimony of an eye-witnessaccount to this revolting practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible conclusion hasalmost always been derived from the second-hand evidence ofEuropeans, or else from the admissions of the savages themselves,after they have in some degree become civilized.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polynesiansare aware of the detestation in which Europeans hold this custom,and therefore invariably deny its existence, and with the craftpeculiar to savages, endeavour to conceal every trace of it.</p><p> The excessive unwillingness betrayed by the Sandwich Islanders,even at the present day, to allude to the unhappy fate of Cook,has often been remarked.&nbsp;&nbsp;And so well have they succeeded incovering the event with mystery, that to this very hour, despiteall that has been said and written on the subject, it stillremains doubtful whether they wreaked upon his murdered body thevengance they sometimes inflicted upon their enemies.</p><p> At Kealakekau, the scene of that tragedy, a strip of ship'scopper nailed against an upright post in the ground used toinform the traveller that beneath reposed the 'remains' of thegreat circumnavigator.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am strongly inclined to believe notonly the corpse was refused Christian burial, but that the heartwhich was brought to Vancouver some time after the event, andwhich the Hawiians stoutly maintained was that of Captain Cook,was no such thing; and that the whole affair was a piece ofimposture which was sought to be palmed off upon the credulousEnglishman.</p><p> A few years since there was living on the island of Maui (one ofthe Sandwich group) an old chief, who, actuated by a morbiddesire for notoriety, gave himself out among the foreignresidents of the place as the living tomb of Captain Cook's bigtoe!--affirming that at the cannibal entertainment which ensuedafter the lamented Briton's death, that particular portion of hisbody had fallen to his share.&nbsp;&nbsp;His indignant countrymen actuallycaused him to be prosecuted in the native courts, on a chargenearly equivalent to what we term defamation of character; butthe old fellow persisting in his assertion, and no invalidatingproof being adduced, the plaintiffs were cast in the suit, andthe cannibal reputation of the defendant firmly established.&nbsp;&nbsp;This result was the making of his fortune; ever afterwards he wasin the habit of giving very profitable audiences to all curioustravellers who were desirous of beholding the man who had eatenthe great navigator's great toe.</p><p> About a week after my discovery of the contents of the mysteriouspackages, I happened to be at the Ti, when another war-alarm wassounded, and the natives rushing to their arms, sallied out toresist a second incursion of the Happar invaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same scenewas again repeated, only that on this occasion I heard at leastfifteen reports of muskets from the mountains during the timethat the skirmish lasted.&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour or two after its termination,loud paeans chanted through the valley announced the approach ofthe victors.&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood with Kory-Kory leaning against the railingof the pi-pi awaiting their advance, when a tumultuous crowd ofislanders emerged with wild clamours from the neighbouringgroves.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of them marched four men, one preceding theother at regular intervals of eight or ten feet, with poles of acorresponding length, extending from shoulder to shoulder, towhich were lashed with thongs of bark three long narrow bundles,carefully wrapped in ample coverings of freshly pluckedpalm-leaves, tacked together with slivers of bamboo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here andthere upon these green winding-sheets might be seen the stains ofblood, while the warriors who carried the frightful burdensdisplayed upon their naked limbs similar sanguinary marks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theshaven head of the foremost had a deep gash upon it, and theclotted gore which had flowed from the wound remained in drypatches around it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage seemed to be sinking under theweight he bore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright tattooing upon his body was coveredwith blood and dust; his inflamed eyes rolled in their sockets,and his whole appearance denoted extraordinary suffering andexertion; yet sustained by some powerful impulse, he continued toadvance, while the throng around him with wild cheers sought toencourage him.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three men were marked about the armsand breasts with several slight wounds, which they somewhatostentatiously displayed.</p><p> These four individuals, having been the most active in the lateencounter, claimed the honour of bearing the bodies of theirslain enemies to the Ti.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the conclusion I drew from myown observations, and, as far as I could understand, from theexplanation which Kory-Kory gave me.</p><p> The royal Mehevi walked by the side of these heroes.&nbsp;&nbsp;He carriedin one hand a musket, from the barrel of which was suspended asmall canvas pouch of powder, and in the other he grasped a shortjavelin, which he held before him and regarded with fierceexultation.&nbsp;&nbsp;This javelin he had wrested from a celebratedchampion of the Happars, who had ignominiously fled, and waspursued by his foes beyond the summit of the mountain.</p><p> When within a short distance of the Ti, the warrior with thewounded head, who proved to be Narmonee, tottered forward two orthree steps, and fell helplessly to the ground; but not beforeanother had caught the end of the pole from his shoulder, andplaced it upon his own.</p><p> The excited throng of islanders, who surrounded the person of theking and the dead bodies of the enemy, approached the spot whereI stood, brandishing their rude implements of warfare, many ofwhich were bruised and broken, and uttering continual shouts oftriumph.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crowd drew up opposite the Ti, I set myself towatch their proceedings most attentively; but scarcely had theyhalted when my servitor, who had left my side for an instant,touched my arm and proposed our returning to Marheyo's house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tothis I objected; but, to my surprise, Kory-Kory reiterated hisrequest, and with an unusual vehemence of manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still,however, I refused to comply, and was retreating before him, asin his importunity he pressed upon me, when I felt a heavy handlaid upon my shoulder, and turning round, encountered the bulkyform of Mow-Mow, a one-eyed chief, who had just detached himselffrom the crowd below, and had mounted the rear of the pi-pi uponwhich we stood.&nbsp;&nbsp;His cheek had been pierced by the point of aspear, and the wound imparted a still more frightful expressionto his hideously tattooed face, already deformed by the loss ofan eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior, without uttering a syllable, pointedfiercely in the direction of Marheyo's house, while Kory-Kory, atthe same time presenting his back, desired me to mount.</p><p> I declined this offer, but intimated my willingness to withdraw,and moved slowly along the piazza, wondering what could be thecause of this unusual treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes' considerationconvinced me that the savages were about to celebrate somehideous rite in connection with their peculiar customs, and atwhich they were determined I should not be present.&nbsp;&nbsp;I descendedfrom the pi-pi, and attended by Kory-Kory, who on this occasiondid not show his usual commiseration for my lameness, but seemedonly anxious to hurry me on, walked away from the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ipassed through the noisy throng, which by this time completelyenvironed the Ti, I looked with fearful curiosity at the threepackages, which now were deposited upon the ground; but althoughI had no doubt as to their contents, still their thick coveringsprevented my actually detecting the form of a human body.</p><p> The next morning, shortly after sunrise, the same thunderingsounds which had awakened me from sleep on the second day of theFeast of Calabashes, assured me that the savages were on the eveof celebrating another, and, as I fully believed, a horriblesolemnity.</p><p> All the inmates of the house, with the exception of Marheyo, hisson, and Tinor, after assuming their gala dresses, departed inthe direction of the Taboo Groves.</p><p> Although I did not anticipate a compliance with my request,still, with a view of testing the truth of my suspicions, Iproposed to Kory-Kory that, according to our usual custom in themorning, we should take a stroll to the Ti: he positivelyrefused; and when I renewed the request, he evinced hisdetermination to prevent my going there; and, to divert my mindfrom the subject, he offered to accompany me to the stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaccordingly went, and bathed.&nbsp;&nbsp;On our coming back to the house, Iwas surprised to find that all its inmates had returned, and werelounging upon the mats as usual, although the drums still soundedfrom the groves.</p><p> The rest of the day I spent with Kory-Kory and Fayaway, wanderingabout a part of the valley situated in an opposite direction fromthe Ti, and whenever I so much as looked towards that building,although it was hidden from view by intervening trees, and at thedistance of more than a mile, my attendant would exclaim, 'Taboo,taboo!'</p><p> At the various houses where we stopped, I found many of theinhabitants reclining at their ease, or pursuing some lightoccupation, as if nothing unusual were going forward; but amongstthem all I did not perceive a single chief or warrior.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Iasked several of the people why they were not at the 'HoolahHoolah' (the feast), their uniformly answered the question in amanner which implied that it was not intended for them, but forMehevi, Narmonee, Mow-Mow, Kolor, Womonoo, Kalow, running over,in their desire to make me comprehend their meaning, the names ofall the principal chiefs.</p><p> Everything, in short, strengthened my suspicions with regard tothe nature of the festival they were now celebrating; and whichamounted almost to a certainty.&nbsp;&nbsp;While in Nukuheva I hadfrequently been informed that the whole tribe were never presentat these cannibal banquets, but the chiefs and priests only; andeverything I now observed agreed with the account.</p><p> The sound of the drums continued without intermission the wholeday, and falling continually upon my ear, caused me a sensationof horror which I am unable to describe.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the following day,hearing none of those noisy indications of revelry, I concludedthat the inhuman feast was terminated; and feeling a kind ofmorbid curiosity to discover whether the Ti might furnish anyevidence of what had taken place there, I proposed to Kory-Koryto walk there.&nbsp;&nbsp;To this proposition he replied by pointing withhis finger to the newly risen sun, and then up to the zenith,intimating that our visit must be deferred until noon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortlyafter that hour we accordingly proceeded to the Taboo Groves, andas soon as we entered their precincts, I looked fearfully roundin, quest of some memorial of the scene which had so lately beenacted there; but everything appeared as usual.&nbsp;&nbsp;On reaching theTi, we found Mehevi and a few chiefs reclining on the mats, whogave me as friendly a reception as ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;No allusions of anykind were made by them to the recent events; and I refrained, forobvious reasons, from referring to them myself.</p><p> After staying a short time I took my leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing along thepiazza, previously to descending from the pi-pi, I observed acuriously carved vessel of wood, of considerable size, with acover placed over it, of the same material, and which resembledin shape a small canoe.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was surrounded by a low railing ofbamboos, the top of which was scarcely a foot from the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the vessel had been placed in its present position since mylast visit, I at once concluded that it must have some connectionwith the recent festival, and, prompted by a curiosity I couldnot repress, in passing it I raised one end of the cover; at thesame moment the chiefs, perceiving my design, loudly ejaculated,'Taboo!&nbsp;&nbsp;taboo!'</p><p> But the slight glimpse sufficed; my eyes fell upon the disorderedmembers of a human skeleton, the bones still fresh with moisture,and with particles of flesh clinging to them here and there!</p><p> Kory-Kory, who had been a little in advance of me, attracted bythe exclamations of the chiefs, turned round in time to witnessthe expression of horror on my countenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;He now hurriedtowards me, pointing at the same time to the canoe, andexclaiming rapidly, 'Puarkee!&nbsp;&nbsp;puarkee!' (Pig, pig).&nbsp;&nbsp;I pretendedto yield to the deception, and repeated the words after himseveral times, as though acquiescing in what he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;The othersavages, either deceived by my conduct or unwilling to manifesttheir displeasure at what could not now be remedied, took nofurther notice of the occurrence, and I immediately left the Ti.</p><p> All that night I lay awake, revolving in my mind the fearfulsituation in which I was placed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last horrid revelation hadnow been made, and the full sense of my condition rushed upon mymind with a force I had never before experienced.</p><p> Where, thought I, desponding, is there the slightest prospect ofescape?&nbsp;&nbsp;The only person who seemed to possess the ability toassist me was the stranger Marnoo; but would he ever return tothe valley?&nbsp;&nbsp;and if he did, should I be permitted to hold anycommunication with him?&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed as if I were cut off fromevery source of hope, and that nothing remained but passively toawait whatever fate was in store for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand times Iendeavoured to account for the mysterious conduct of the natives.</p><p> For what conceivable purpose did they thus retain me a captive?&nbsp;&nbsp;What could be their object in treating me with such apparentkindness, and did it not cover some treacherous scheme?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, ifthey had no other design than to hold me a prisoner, how should Ibe able to pass away my days in this narrow valley, deprived ofall intercourse with civilized beings, and for ever separatedfrom friends and home?</p><p> One only hope remained to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;The French could not long defer avisit to the bay, and if they should permanently locate any oftheir troops in the valley, the savages could not for any lengthof time conceal my existence from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what reason had I tosuppose that I should be spared until such an event occurred, anevent which might be postponed by a hundred differentcontingencies?</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Thirty-three</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p> THE STRANGER AGAIN ARRIVES IN THE VALLEY--SINGULAR INTERVIEW WITHHIM--ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE--FAILURE--MELANCHOLY SITUATION--SYMPATHYOF MARHEYO</p><p> 'MARNOO, Marnoo pemi!'&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the welcome sounds which fellupon my ear some ten days after the events related in thepreceding chapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more the approach of the stranger washeralded, and the intelligence operated upon me like magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I should be able to converse with him in my own language;and I resolve at all hazards to concert with him some scheme,however desperate, to rescue me from a condition that had nowbecome insupportable.</p><p> As he drew near, I remembered with many misgivings theinauspicious termination of our former interview, and when heentered the house, I watched with intense anxiety the receptionhe met with from its inmates.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my joy, his appearance washailed with the liveliest pleasure; and accosting me kindly, heseated himself by my, side, and entered into conversation withthe natives around him.&nbsp;&nbsp;It soon appeared however, that on thisoccasion he had not any intelligence of importance tocommunicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I inquired of him from whence he had just come?&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereplied from Pueearka, his native valley, and that he intended toreturn to it the same day.</p><p> At once it struck me that, could I but reach that valley underhis protection, I might easily from thence reach Nukuheva bywater; and animated by the prospect which this plan held, out Idisclosed it in a few brief words to the stranger, and asked himhow it could be best accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart sunk within me, whenin his broken English he answered me that it could never beeffected.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Kanaka no let you go nowhere,' he said; 'you taboo.Why you no like to stay?&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty moee-moee (sleep)--plenty ki-ki(eat)--plenty wahenee (young girls)--Oh, very good place Typee!&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose you no like this bay, why you come?&nbsp;&nbsp;You no hear aboutTypee?&nbsp;&nbsp;All white men afraid Typee, so no white men come.'</p><p> These words distressed me beyond belief; and when I had againrelated to him the circumstances under which I had descended intothe valley, and sought to enlist his sympathies in my behalf byappealing to the bodily misery I had endure, he listened withimpatience, and cut me short by exclaiming passionately, 'Me nohear you talk any more; by by Kanaka get mad, kill you and metoo.&nbsp;&nbsp;No you see he no want you to speak at all?--you see--ah! by by you no mind--you get well, he kill you, eat you, hang youhead up there, like Happar Kanaka.--Now you listen--but no talkany more.&nbsp;&nbsp;By by I go;--you see way I go--Ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;then some nightKanaka all moee-moee (sleep)--you run away, you come Pueearka.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ispeak Pueearka Kanaka--he no harm you--ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;then I take you mycanoe Nukuheva--and you run away ship no more.'&nbsp;&nbsp;With thesewords, enforced by a vehemence of gesture I cannot describe,Marnoo started from my side, and immediately engaged inconversation with some of the chiefs who had entered the house.</p><p> It would have been idle for me to have attempted resuming theinterview so peremptorily terminated by Marnoo, who was evidentlylittle disposed to compromise his own safety by any rashendeavour to ensure mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the plan he had suggested struckme as one which might possibly be accomplished, and I resolved toact upon it as speedily as possible.</p><p> Accordingly, when he arose to depart, I accompanied him with thenatives outside of the house, with a view of carefully noting thepath he would take in leaving the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before leapingfrom the pi-pi he clasped my hand, and looking significantly atme, exclaimed, 'Now you see--you do what I tell you--ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;thenyou do good;--you no do so--ah!&nbsp;&nbsp;then you die.'&nbsp;&nbsp;The next momenthe waved his spear to the islanders, and following the route thatconducted to a defile in the mountains lying opposite the Happarside, was soon out of sight.</p><p> A mode of escape was now presented to me, but how was I to availmyself of it?&nbsp;&nbsp;I was continually surrounded by the savages; Icould not stir from one house to another without being attendedby some of them; and even during the hours devoted to slumber,the slightest movement which I made seemed to attract the noticeof those who shared the mats with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of theseobstacles, however, I determined forthwith to make the attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;To do so with any prospect of success, it was necessary that Ishould have at least two hours start before the islanders shoulddiscover my absence; for with such facility was any alarm spreadthrough the valley, and so familiar, of course, were theinhabitants with the intricacies of the groves, that I could nothope, lame and feeble as I was, and ignorant of the route, tosecure my escape unless I had this advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also bynight alone that I could hope to accomplish my object, and thenonly by adopting the utmost precaution.</p><p> The entrance to Marheyo's habitation was through a low narrowopening in its wicker-work front.&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage, for noconceivable reason that I could devise, was always closed afterthe household had retired to rest, by drawing a heavy slideacross it, composed of a dozen or more bits of wood, ingeniouslyfastened together by seizings of sinnate.&nbsp;&nbsp;When any of theinmates chose to go outside, the noise occasioned by the removingof this rude door awakened every body else; and on more than oneoccasion I had remarked that the islanders were nearly asirritable as more civilized beings under similar circumstances.</p><p> The difficulty thus placed in my way I, determined to obviate inthe following manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would get up boldly in the course of thenight, and drawing the slide, issue from the house, and pretendthat my object was merely to procure a drink from the calabash,which always stood without the dwelling on the corner of thepi-pi.&nbsp;&nbsp;On re-entering I would purposely omit closing the passageafter me, and trusting that the indolence of the savages wouldprevent them from repairing my neglect, would return to my mat,and waiting patiently until all were again asleep, I would thensteal forth, and at once take the route to Pueearka.</p><p> The very night which followed Marnoo's departure, I proceeded toput this project into execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;About midnight, as I imagined,I arose and drew the slide.&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives, just as I had expected,started up, while some of them asked, 'Arware poo awa, Tommo?'(where are you going, Tommo?)&nbsp;&nbsp;'Wai' (water) I laconicallyanswered, grasping the calabash.&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing my reply they sankback again, and in a minute or two I returned to my mat,anxiously awaiting the result of the experiment.</p><p> One after another the savages, turning restlessly, appeared toresume their slumbers, and rejoicing at the stillness whichprevailed, I was about to rise again from my couch, when I hearda slight rustling--a dark form was intercepted between me and thedoorway--the slide was drawn across it, and the individual,whoever he was, returned to his mat.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a sad blow to me;but as it might have aroused the suspicions of the islanders tohave made another attempt that night, I was reluctantly obligedto defer it until the next.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several times after I repeated thesame manoeuvre, but with as little success as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;As mypretence for withdrawing from the house was to allay my thirst,Kory-Kory either suspecting some design on my part, or elseprompted by a desire to please me, regularly every evening placeda calabash of water by my side.</p><p> Even, under these inauspicious circumstances I again and againrenewed the attempt, but when I did so, my valet always rose withme, as if determined I should not remove myself from hisobservation.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the present, therefore, I was obliged toabandon the attempt; but I endeavoured to console myself with theidea that by this mode I might yet effect my escape.</p><p> Shortly after Marnoo's visit I was reduced to such a state thatit was with extreme difficulty I could walk, even with theassistance of a spear, and Kory-Kory, as formerly, was obliged tocarry me daily to the stream.</p><p> For hours and hours during the warmest part of the day I lay uponmy mat, and while those around me were nearly all dozing away incareless ease, I remained awake, gloomily pondering over the fatewhich it appeared now idle for me to resist, when I thought ofthe loved friends who were thousands and thousands of miles fromthe savage island in which I was held a captive, when I reflectedthat my dreadful fate would for ever be concealed from them, andthat with hope deferred they might continue to await my returnlong after my inanimate form had blended with the dust of thevalley--I could not repress a shudder of anguish.</p><p> How vividly is impressed upon my mind every minute feature of thescene which met my view during those long days of suffering andsorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;At my request my mats were always spread directly facingthe door, opposite which, and at a little distance, was the hutof boughs that Marheyo was building.</p><p> Whenever my gentle Fayaway and Kory-Kory, laying themselves downbeside me, would leave me awhile to uninterrupted repose, I tooka strange interest in the slightest movements of the eccentricold warrior.&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone during the stillness of the tropicalmid-day, he would pursue his quiet work, sitting in the shade andweaving together the leaflets of his cocoanut branches, orrolling upon his knee the twisted fibres of bark to form thecords with which he tied together the thatching of his tinyhouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequently suspending his employment, and noticing mymelancholy eye fixed upon him, he would raise his hand with agesture expressive of deep commiseration, and then moving towardsme slowly, would enter on tip-toes, fearful of disturbing theslumbering natives, and, taking the fan from my hand, would sitbefore me, swaying it gently to and fro, and gazing earnestlyinto my face.</p><p> Just beyond the pi-pi, and disposed in a triangle before theentrance of the house, were three magnificent bread-fruit trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment I can recap to my mind their slender shafts, andthe graceful inequalities of their bark, on which my eye wasaccustomed to dwell day after day in the midst of my solitarymusings.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is strange how inanimate objects will twinethemselves into our affections, especially in the hour ofaffliction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now, amidst all the bustle and stir of theproud and busy city in which I am dwelling, the image of thosethree trees seems to come as vividly before my eyes as if theywere actually present, and I still feel the soothing quietpleasure which I then had in watching hour after hour theirtopmost boughs waving gracefully in the breeze.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter Thirty-four</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p><p> THE ESCAPE</p><p> NEARLY three weeks had elapsed since the second visit of Marnoo,and it must have been more than four months since I entered thevalley, when one day about noon, and whilst everything was inprofound silence, Mow-Mow, the one-eyed chief, suddenly appearedat the door, and leaning towards me as I lay directly facing him,said in a low tone, 'Toby pemi ena' (Toby has arrived here).&nbsp;&nbsp;Gracious heaven!&nbsp;&nbsp;What a tumult of emotions rushed upon me atthis startling intelligence!&nbsp;&nbsp;Insensible to the pain that hadbefore distracted me, I leaped to my feet, and called wildly toKory-Kory who was reposing by my side.&nbsp;&nbsp;The startled islanderssprang from their mats; the news was quickly communicated tothem; and the next moment I was making my way to the Ti on theback of Kory-Kory; and surrounded by the excited savages.</p><p> All that I could comprehend of the particulars which Mow-Mowrehearsed to his audience as we proceeded, was that my long-lostcompanion had arrived in a boat which had just entered the bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;These tidings made me most anxious to be carried at once to thesea, lest some untoward circumstance should prevent our meeting;but to this they would not consent, and continued their coursetowards the royal abode.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we approached it, Mehevi and severalchiefs showed themselves from the piazza, and called upon usloudly to come to them.</p><p> As soon as we had approached, I endeavoured to make themunderstand that I was going down to the sea to meet Toby.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tothis the king objected, and motioned Kory-Kory to bring me intothe house.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in vain to resist; and in a few moments Ifound myself within the Ti, surrounded by a noisy group engagedin discussing the recent intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby's name wasfrequently repeated, coupled with violent exclamations ofastonishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed as if they yet remained in doubt withregard to the fact of his arrival, at at every fresh report thatwas brought from the shore they betrayed the liveliest emotions.</p><p> Almost frenzied at being held in this state of suspense, Ipassionately besought Mehevi to permit me to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether mycompanion had arrived or not, I felt a presentiment that my ownfate was about to be decided.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again and again I renewed mypetition to Mehevi.&nbsp;&nbsp;He regarded me with a fixed and serious eye,but at length yielding to my importunity, reluctantly granted myrequest.</p><p> Accompanied by some fifty of the natives, I now rapidly continuedmy journey; every few moments being transferred from the back ofone to another, and urging my bearer forward all the while withearnest entreaties.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I thus hurried forward, no doubt as tothe truth of the information I had received ever crossed my mind.</p><p> I was alive only to the one overwhelming idea, that a chance ofdeliverance was now afforded me, if the jealous opposition of thesavages could be overcome.</p><p> Having been prohibited from approaching the sea during the wholeof my stay in the valley, I had always associated with it theidea of escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby too--if indeed he had ever voluntarilydeserted me--must have effected this flight by the sea; and nowthat I was drawing near to it myself, I indulged in hopes which Ihad never felt before.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was evident that a boat had enteredthe bay, and I saw little reason to doubt the truth of the reportthat it had brought my companion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time therefore that wegained an elevation, I looked eagerly around, hoping to beholdhim.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of an excited throng, who by their violentgestures and wild cries appeared to be under the influence ofsome excitement as strong as my own, I was now borne along at arapid trot, frequently stooping my head to avoid the brancheswhich crossed the path, and never ceasing to implore those whocarried me to accelerate their already swift pace.</p><p> In this manner we had proceeded about four or five miles, when wewere met by a party of some twenty islanders, between whom andthose who accompanied me ensued an animated conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;Impatient of the delay occasioned by this interruption, I wasbeseeching the man who carried me to proceed without hisloitering companions, when Kory-Kory, running to my side,informed me, in three fatal words, that the news had all proved,false--that Toby had not arrived--'Toby owlee pemi'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven onlyknows how, in the state of mind and body I then was, I eversustained the agony which this intelligence caused me; not thatthe news was altogether unexpected; but I had trusted that thefact might not have been made known until we should have arrivedupon the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it was, I at once foresaw the course thesavages would pursue.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had only yielded thus far to myentreaties, that I might give a joyful welcome to my long-lostcomrade; but now that it was known he had not arrived they wouldat once oblige me to turn back.</p><p> My anticipations were but too correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of theresistance I made, they carried me into a house which was nearthe spot, and left me upon the mats.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly afterwards severalof those who had accompanied me from the Ti, detaching themselvesfrom the others, proceeded in the direction of the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thosewho remained--among whom were Marheyo, Mow-Mow, Kory-Kory, andTinor--gathered about the dwelling, and appeared to be awaitingtheir return.</p><p> This convinced me that strangers--perhaps some of my owncountrymen--had for some cause or other entered the bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Distracted at the idea of their vicinity, and reckless of thepain which I suffered, I heeded not the assurances of theislanders, that there were no boats at the beach, but starting tomy feet endeavoured to gain the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly the passage wasblocked up by several men, who commanded me to resume my seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce looks of the irritated savages admonished me that Icould gain nothing by force, and that it was by entreaty alonethat I could hope to compass my object.</p><p> Guided by this consideration, I turned to Mow-Mow, the only chiefpresent whom I had been much in the habit of seeing, andcarefully concealing, my real design, tried to make himcomprehend that I still believed Toby to have arrived on theshore, and besought him to allow me to go forward to welcome him.</p><p> To all his repeated assertions, that my companion had not beenseen, I pretended to turn a deaf ear, while I urged mysolicitations with an eloquence of gesture which the one-eyedchief appeared unable to resist.&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed indeed to regard meas a forward child, to whose wishes he had not the heart tooppose force, and whom he must consequently humour.&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke afew words to the natives, who at once retreated from the door,and I immediately passed out of the house.</p><p> Here I looked earnestly round for Kory-Kory; but that hithertofaithful servitor was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwilling to lingereven for a single instant when every moment might be soimportant, I motioned to a muscular fellow near me to take meupon his back; to my surprise he angrily refused.&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned toanother, but with a like result.&nbsp;&nbsp;A third attempt was asunsuccessful, and I immediately perceived what had inducedMow-Mow to grant my request, and why the other natives conductedthemselves in so strange a manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was evident that the chiefhad only given me liberty to continue my progress towards thesea, because he supposed that I was deprived of the means ofreaching it.</p><p> Convinced by this of their determination to retain me a captive,I became desperate; and almost insensible to the pain which Isuffered, I seized a spear which was leaning against theprojecting eaves of the house, and supporting myself with it,resumed the path that swept by the dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my surprise, Iwas suffered to proceed alone; all the natives remaining in frontof the house, and engaging in earnest conversation, which everymoment became more loud and vehement; and to my unspeakabledelight, I perceived that some difference of opinion had arisenbetween them; that two parties, in short, were formed, andconsequently that in their divided counsels there was some chanceof my deliverance.</p><p> Before I had proceeded a hundred yards I was again surrounded bythe savages, who were still in all the heat of argument, andappeared every moment as if they would come to blows.&nbsp;&nbsp;In themidst of this tumult old Marheyo came to my side, and I shallnever forget the benevolent expression of his countenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heplaced his arm upon my shoulder, and emphatically pronounced theonly two English words I had taught him 'Home' and 'Mother'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iat once understood what he meant, and eagerly expressed my thanksto him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fayaway and Kory-Kory were by his side, both weepingviolently; and it was not until the old man had twice repeatedthe command that his son could bring himself to obey him, andtake me again upon his back.&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed chief opposed hisdoing so, but he was overruled, and, as it seemed to me, by someof his own party.</p><p> We proceeded onwards, and never shall I forget the ecstasy I feltwhen I first heard the roar of the surf breaking upon the beach. Before long I saw the flashing billows themselves through theopening between the trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh glorious sight and sound of ocean!with what rapture did I hail you as familiar friends!&nbsp;&nbsp;By thistime the shouts of the crowd upon the beach were distinctlyaudible, and in the blended confusion of sounds I almost fanciedI could distinguish the voices of my own countrymen.</p><p> When we reached the open space which lay between the groves andthe sea, the first object that met my view was an Englishwhale-boat, lying with her bow pointed from the shore, and only afew fathoms distant from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was manned by five islanders,dressed in shirt tunics of calico.&nbsp;&nbsp;My first impression was thatthey were in the very act of pulling out from the bay; and that,after all my exertions, I had come too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul sunk withinme: but a second glance convinced me that the boat was onlyhanging off to keep out of the surf; and the next moment I heardmy own name shouted out by a voice from the midst of the crowd.</p><p> Looking in the direction of the sound, I perceived, to myindescribable joy, the tall figure of Karakoee, an Oahu Kanaka,who had often been aboard the 'Dolly', while she lay in Nukuheva.</p><p> He wore the green shooting-jacket with gilt buttons, which hadbeen given to him by an officer of the Reine Blanche--the Frenchflag-ship--and in which I had always seen him dressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I nowremembered the Kanaka had frequently told me that his person wastabooed in all the valleys of the island, and the sight of him atsuch a moment as this filled my heart with a tumult of delight.</p><p> Karakoee stood near the edge of the water with a large roll ofcotton-cloth thrown over one arm, and holding two or three canvasbags of powder, while with the other hand he grasped a musket,which he appeared to be proffering to several of the chiefsaround him.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they turned with disgust from his offers andseemed to be impatient at his presence, with vehement gestureswaving him off to his boat, and commanding him to depart.</p><p> The Kanaka, however, still maintained his ground, and I at onceperceived that he was seeking to purchase my freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Animatedby the idea, I called upon him loudly to come to me; but hereplied, in broken English, that the islanders had threatened topierce him with their spears, if he stirred a foot towards me.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time I was still advancing, surrounded by a dense throngof the natives, several of whom had their hands upon me, and morethan one javelin was threateningly pointed at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still Iperceived clearly that many of those least friendly towards melooked irresolute land anxious.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still some thirty yardsfrom Karakoee when my farther progress was prevented by thenatives, who compelled me to sit down upon the ground, while theystill retained their hold upon my arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;The din and tumult nowbecame tenfold, and I perceived that several of the priests wereon the spot, all of whom were evidently urging Mow-Mow and theother chiefs to prevent my departure; and the detestable word'Roo-ne!&nbsp;&nbsp;Roo-ne!' which I had heard repeated a thousand timesduring the day, was now shouted out on every side of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still Isaw that the Kanaka continued his exertions in my favour--that hewas boldly debating the matter with the savages, and was strivingto entice them by displaying his cloth and powder, and snappingthe lock of his musket.&nbsp;&nbsp;But all he said or did appeared only toaugment the clamours of those around him, who seemed bent upondriving him into the sea.</p><p> When I remembered the extravagant value placed by these peopleupon the articles which were offered to them in exchange for me,and which were so indignantly rejected, I saw a new proof of thesame fixed determination of purpose they had all along manifestedwith regard to me, and in despair, and reckless of consequences,I exerted all my strength, and shaking myself free from the graspof those who held me, I sprang upon my feet and rushed towardsKarakoee.</p><p> The rash attempt nearly decided my fate; for, fearful that Imight slip from them, several of the islanders now raised asimultaneous shout, and pressing upon Karakoee, they menaced himwith furious gestures, and actually forced him into the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Appalled at their violence, the poor fellow, standing nearly tothe waist in the surf, endeavoured to pacify them; but at lengthfearful that they would do him some fatal violence, he beckonedto his comrades to pull in at once, and take him into the boat.</p><p> It was at this agonizing moment, when I thought all hope wasended, that a new contest arose between the two parties who hadaccompanied me to the shore; blows were struck, wounds weregiven, and blood flowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest excited by the fray,every one had left me except Marheyo, Kory-Kory and poor dearFayaway, who clung to me, sobbing indignantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that now ornever was the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasping my hands together, I lookedimploringly at Marheyo, and move towards the now almost desertedbeach.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears were in the old man's eyes, but neither he norKory-Kory attempted to hold me, and I soon reached the Kanaka,who had anxiously watched my movements; the rowers pulled in asnear as they dared to the edge of the surf; I gave one partingembrace to Fayaway, who seemed speechless with sorrow, and thenext instant I found myself safe in the boat, and Karakoee by myside, who told the rowers at once to give way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marheyo andKory-Kory, and a great many of the women, followed me into thewater, and I was determined, as the only mark of gratitude Icould show, to give them the articles which had been brought asmy ransom.&nbsp;&nbsp;I handed the musket to Kory-Kory, with a rapidgesture which was equivalent to a 'Deed of Gift'; threw the rollof cotton to old Marheyo, pointing as I did so to poor Fayaway,who had retired from the edge of the water and was sitting downdisconsolate on the shingles; and tumbled the powder-bags out tothe nearest young ladies, all of whom were vastly willing to takethem.&nbsp;&nbsp;This distribution did not occupy ten seconds, and beforeit was over the boat was under full way; the Kanaka all the whileexclaiming loudly against what he considered a useless throwingaway of valuable property.</p><p> Although it was dear that my movements had been noticed byseveral of the natives, still they had not suspended the conflictin which they were engaged, and it was not until the boat wasabove fifty yards from the shore that Mow-Mow and some six orseven other warriors rushed into the sea and hurled theirjavelins at us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the weapons passed quite as close to usas was desirable, but no one was wounded, and the men pulled awaygallantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;But although soon out of the reach of the spears, ourprogress was extremely slow; it blew strong upon the shore, andthe tide was against us; and I saw Karakoee, who was steering theboat, give many a look towards a jutting point of the bay roundwhich we had to pass.</p><p> For a minute or two after our departure, the savages, who hadformed into different groups, remained perfectly motionless andsilent.&nbsp;&nbsp;All at-once the enraged chief showed by his gesturesthat he had resolved what course he would take.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouting loudlyto his companions, and pointing with his tomahawk towards theheadland, he set off at full speed in that direction, and wasfollowed by about thirty of the natives, among whom were severalof the priests, all yelling out 'Roo-ne!&nbsp;&nbsp;Roo-ne!' at the verytop of their voices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their intention was evidently to swim offfrom the headland and intercept us in our course.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind wasfreshening every minute, and was right in our teeth, and it wasone of those chopping angry seas in which it is so difficult torow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the chances seemed in our favour, but when we camewithin a hundred yards of the point, the active savages werealready dashing into the water, and we all feared that withinfive minutes' time we should have a score of the infuriatedwretches around us.&nbsp;&nbsp;If so our doom was sealed, for thesesavages, unlike the feeble swimmer of civilized countries, are,if anything, more formidable antagonists in the water than whenon the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was all a trial of strength; our natives pulledtill their oars bent again, and the crowd of swimmers shotthrough the water despite its roughness, with fearful rapidity.</p><p> By the time we had reached the headland, the savages were spreadright across our course.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rowers got out their knives andheld them ready between their teeth, and I seized the boat-hook.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were all aware that if they succeeded in intercepting us theywould practise upon us the manoeuvre which has proved so fatal tomany a boat's crew in these seas.&nbsp;&nbsp;They would grapple the oars,and seizing hold of the gunwhale, capsize the boat, and then weshould be entirely at their mercy.</p><p> After a few breathless moments discerned Mow-Mow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The athleticislander, with his tomahawk between his teeth, was dashing thewater before him till it foamed again.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the nearest to us,and in another instant he would have seized one of the oars.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at the moment I felt horror at the act I was about tocommit; but it was no time for pity or compunction, and with atrue aim, and exerting all my strength, I dashed the boat-hook athim.&nbsp;&nbsp;It struck him just below the throat, and forced himdownwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no time to repeat the blow, but I saw him riseto the surface in the wake of the boat, and never shall I forgetthe ferocious expression of his countenance.</p><p> Only one other of the savages reached the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;He seized thegunwhale, but the knives of our rowers so mauled his wrists, thathe was forced to quit his hold, and the next minute we were pastthem all, and in safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong excitement which had thusfar kept me up, now left me, and I fell back fainting into thearms of Karakoee.</p><p> .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p><p> The circumstances connected with my most unexpected escape may bevery briefly stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of an Australian vessel, beingin distress for men in these remote seas, had put into Nukuhevain order to recruit his ship's company; but not a single man wasto be obtained; and the barque was about to get under weigh, whenshe was boarded by Karakoee, who informed the disappointedEnglishman that an American sailor was detained by the savages inthe neighbouring bay of Typee; and he offered, if supplied withsuitable articles of traffic, to undertake his release.&nbsp;&nbsp;TheKanaka had gained his intelligence from Marnoo, to whom, afterall, I was indebted for my escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposition was accededto; and Karakoee, taking with him five tabooed natives ofNukuheva, again repaired aboard the barque, which in a few hourssailed to that part of the island, and threw her main-top-sailaback right off the entrance to the Typee bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;The whale-boat,manned by the tabooed crew, pulled towards the head of the inlet,while the ship lay 'off and on' awaiting its return.</p><p> The events which ensued have already been detailed, and littlemore remains to be related.&nbsp;&nbsp;On reaching the 'Julia' I was liftedover the side, and my strange appearance and remarkable adventureoccasioned the liveliest interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every attention was bestowedupon me that humanity could suggest.&nbsp;&nbsp;But to such a state was Ireduced, that three months elapsed before I recovered my health.</p><p> The mystery which hung over the fate of my friend and companionToby has never been cleared up.&nbsp;&nbsp;I still remain ignorant whetherhe succeeded in leaving the valley, or perished at the hands ofthe islanders.</p><p> </p><p> THE STORY OF TOBY</p><p> THE morning my comrade left me, as related in the narrative, hewas accompanied by a large party of the natives, some of themcarrying fruit and hogs for the purposes of traffic, as thereport had spread that boats had touched at the bay.</p><p> As they proceeded through the settled parts of the valley,numbers joined them from every side, running with animated criesfrom every pathway.&nbsp;&nbsp;So excited were the whole party, that eageras Toby was to gain the beach, it was almost as much as he coulddo to keep up with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the valley ring with theirshouts, they hurried along on a swift trot, those in advancepausing now and then, and flourishing their weapons to urge therest forward.</p><p> Presently they came to a place where the paths crossed a bend ofthe main stream of the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here a strange sound came throughthe grove beyond, and the Islanders halted.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Mow-Mow, theone-eyed chief, who had gone on before; he was striking his heavylance against the hollow bough of a tree.</p><p> This was a signal of alarm;--for nothing was now heard but shoutsof 'Happar!&nbsp;&nbsp;Happar!'--the warriors tilting with their spears andbrandishing them in the air, and the women and boys shouting toeach other, and picking up the stones in the bed of the stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment or two Mow-Mow and two or three other chiefs ran outfrom the grove, and the din increased ten fold.</p><p> Now, thought Toby, for a fray; and being unarmed, he besought oneof the young men domiciled with Marheyo for the loan of hisspear.&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was refused; the youth roguishly telling him thatthe weapon was very good for him (the Typee), but that a whiteman could fight much better with his fists.</p><p> The merry humour of this young wag seemed to be shared by therest, for in spite of their warlike cries and gestures, everybodywas capering and laughing, as if it was one of the funniestthings in the world to be awaiting the flight of a score or twoof Happar javelins from an ambush in the thickets.</p><p> While my comrade was in vain trying to make out the meaning ofall this, a good number of the natives separated themselves fromthe rest and ran off into the grove on one side, the others nowkeeping perfectly still, as if awaiting the result.&nbsp;&nbsp;After alittle while, however, Mow-Mow, who stood in advance, motionedthem to come on stealthily, which they did, scarcely rustling aleaf.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they crept along for ten or fifteen minutes, everynow and then pausing to listen.</p><p> Toby by no means relished this sort of skulking; if there wasgoing to be a fight, he wanted it to begin at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;But all ingood time,--for just then, as they went prowling into thethickest of the wood, terrific howls burst upon them on allsides, and volleys of darts and stones flew across the path.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notan enemy was to be seen, and what was still more surprising, nota single man dropped, though the pebbles fell among the leaveslike hail.</p><p> There was a moment's pause, when the Typees, with wild shrieks,flung themselves into the covert, spear in hand; nor was Tobybehindhand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming so near getting his skull broken by thestones, and animated by an old grudge he bore the Happars, he wasamong the first to dash at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;As he broke his way through theunderbush, trying, as he did so, to wrest a spear from a youngchief, the shouts of battle all of a sudden ceased, and the woodwas as still as death.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the party who had leftthem so mysteriously rushed out from behind every bush and tree,and united with the rest in long and merry peals of laughter.</p><p> It was all a sham, and Toby, who was quite out of breath withexcitement, was much incensed at being made a fool of.</p><p> It afterwards turned out that the whole affair had been concertedfor his particular benefit, though with what precise view itwould be hard to tell.&nbsp;&nbsp;My comrade was the more enraged at thisboys' play, since it had consumed so much time, every moment ofwhich might be precious.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, however, it was partlyintended for this very purpose; and he was led to think so,because when the natives started again, he observed that they didnot seem to be in so great a hurry as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, afterthey had gone some distance, Toby, thinking all the while thatthey never would get to the sea, two men came running towardsthem, and a regular halt ensued, followed by a noisy discussion,during which Toby's name was often repeated.&nbsp;&nbsp;All this made himmore and more anxious to learn what was going on at the beach;but it was in vain that he now tried to push forward; the nativesheld him back.</p><p> In a few moments the conference ended, and many of them ran downthe path in the direction of the water, the rest surroundingToby, and entreating him to 'Moee', or sit down and rest himself.</p><p> As an additional inducement, several calabashes of food, whichhad been brought along, were now placed on the ground, andopened, and pipes also were lighted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby bridled his impatiencea while, but at last sprang to his feet and dashed forward again.</p><p> He was soon overtaken nevertheless, and again surrounded, butwithout further detention was then permitted to go down to thesea.</p><p> They came out upon a bright green space between the groves andthe water, and close under the shadow of the Happar mountain,where a path was seen winding out of sight through a gorge.</p><p> No sign of a boat, however, was beheld, nothing but a tumultuouscrowd of men and women, and some one in their midst, earnestlytalking to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;As my comrade advanced, this person cameforward and proved to be no stranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was an old grizzledsailor, whom Toby and myself had frequently seen in Nukuheva,where he lived an easy devil-may-care life in the household ofMowanna the king, going by the name of 'Jimmy'.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact he wasthe royal favourite, and had a good deal to say in his master'scouncils.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a Manilla hat and a sort of tappa morninggown, sufficiently loose and negligent to show the verse of asong tattooed upon his chest, and a variety of spirited cuts bynative artists in other parts of his body.&nbsp;&nbsp;He sported a fishingrod in his hand, and carried a sooty old pipe slung about hisneck.</p><p> This old rover having retired from active life, had resided inNukuheva some time--could speak the language, and for that reasonwas frequently employed by the French as an interpreter.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasan arrant old gossip too; for ever coming off in his canoe to theships in the bay, and regaling their crews with choice littlemorsels of court scandal--such, for instance, as a shamefulintrigue of his majesty with a Happar damsel, a public dancer atthe feasts--and otherwise relating some incredible tales aboutthe Marquesas generally.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in particular his tellingthe Dolly's crew what proved to be literally a cock-and-bullstory, about two natural prodigies which he said were then on theisland.&nbsp;&nbsp;One was an old monster of a hermit, having a marvellousreputation for sanctity, and reputed a famous sorcerer, who livedaway off in a den among the mountains, where he hid from theworld a great pair of horns that grew out of his temples.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding his reputation for piety, this horrid old fellowwas the terror of all the island round, being reported to comeout from his retreat, and go a man-hunting every dark night.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some anonymous Paul Pry, too, coming down the mountain, once gota peep at his den, and found it full of bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, he wasa most unheard-of monster.</p><p> The other prodigy Jimmy told us about was the younger son of achief, who, although but just turned of ten, had entered uponholy orders, because his superstitious countrymen thought himespecially intended for the priesthood from the fact of hishaving a comb on his head like a rooster.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this was not all;for still more wonderful to relate, the boy prided himself uponhis strange crest, being actually endowed with a cock's voice,and frequently crowing over his peculiarity.</p><p> But to return to Toby.&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment he saw the old rover on thebeach, he ran up to him, the natives following after, and forminga circle round them.</p><p> After welcoming him to the shore, Jimmy went on to tell him howthat he knew all about our having run away from the ship, andbeing among the Typees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, he had been urged by Mowanna tocome over to the valley, and after visiting his friends there, tobring us back with him, his royal master being exceedinglyanxious to share with him the reward which had been held out forour capture.&nbsp;&nbsp;He, however, assured Toby that he had indignantlyspurned the offer.</p><p> All this astonished my comrade not a little, as neither of us hadentertained the least idea that any white man ever visited theTypees sociably.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jimmy told him that such was the casenevertheless, although he seldom came into the bay, and scarcelyever went back from the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the priests of the valley,in some way or other connected with an old tattooed divine inNukuheva, was a friend of his, and through him he was 'taboo'.</p><p> He said, moreover, that he was sometimes employed to come roundto the bay, and engage fruit for ships lying in Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;Infact, he was now on that very errand, according to his ownaccount, having just come across the mountains by the way ofHappar.&nbsp;&nbsp;By noon of the next day the fruit would be heaped up instacks on the beach, in readiness for the boats which he thenintended to bring into the bay.</p><p> Jimmy now asked Toby whether he wished to leave the island--if hedid, there was a ship in want of men lying in the other harbour,and he would be glad to take him over, and see him on board thatvery day.</p><p> 'No,' said Toby, 'I cannot leave the island unless my comradegoes with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I left him up the valley because they would notlet him come down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go now and fetch him.'</p><p> 'But how is he to cross the mountain with us,' replied Jimmy,'even if we get him down to the beach?&nbsp;&nbsp;Better let him stay tilltomorrow, and I will bring him round to Nukuheva in the boats.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> 'That will never do,' said Toby, 'but come along with me now, andlet us get him down here at any rate,' and yielding to theimpulse of the moment, he started to hurry back into the valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;But hardly was his back turned, when a dozen hands were laid onhim, and he learned that he could not go a step further.</p><p> It was in vain that he fought with them; they would not hear ofhis stirring from the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut to the heart at this unexpectedrepulse, Toby now conjured the sailor to go after me alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;ButJimmy replied, that in the mood the Typees then were they wouldnot permit him so to do, though at the same time he was notafraid of their offering him any harm.</p><p> Little did Toby then think, as he afterwards had good reason tosuspect, that this very Jimmy was a heartless villain, who, byhis arts, had just incited the natives to restrain him as he wasin the act of going after me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well must the old sailor haveknown, too, that the natives would never consent to our leavingtogether, and he therefore wanted to get Toby off alone, for apurpose which he afterwards made plain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all this, however, mycomrade now knew nothing.</p><p> He was still struggling with the islanders when Jimmy again cameup to him, and warned him against irritating them, saying that hewas only making matters worse for both of us, and if they becameenraged, there was no telling what might happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he madeToby sit down on a broken canoe by a pile of stones, upon whichwas a ruinous little shrine supported by four upright poles, andin front partly screened by a net.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishing parties metthere, when they came in from the sea, for their offerings werelaid before an image, upon a smooth black stone within.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thisspot Jimmy said was strictly 'taboo', and no one would molest orcome near him while he stayed by its shadow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The old sailor thenwent off, and began speaking very earnestly to Mow-Mow and someother chiefs, while all the rest formed a circle round the tabooplace, looking intently at Toby, and talking to each otherwithout ceasing.</p><p> Now, notwithstanding what Jimmy had just told him, therepresently came up to my comrade an old woman, who seated herselfbeside him on the canoe.</p><p> 'Typee motarkee?'&nbsp;&nbsp;said she.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Motarkee nuee,' said Toby.</p><p> She then asked him whether he was going to Nukuheva; he noddedyes; and with a plaintive wall and her eyes filling with tearsshe rose and left him.</p><p> This old woman, the sailor afterwards said, was the wife of anaged king of a small island valley, communicating by a deep passwith the country of the Typees.&nbsp;&nbsp;The inmates of the two valleyswere related to each other by blood, and were known by the samename.&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman had gone down into the Typee valley the daybefore, and was now with three chiefs, her sons, on a visit toher kinsmen.</p><p> As the old king's wife left him, Jimmy again came up to Toby, andtold him that he had just talked the whole matter over with thenatives, and there was only one course for him to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Theywould not allow him to go back into the valley, and harm wouldcertainly come to both him and me, if he remained much longer onthe beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;'So,' said he, 'you and I had better go to Nukuhevanow overland, and tomorrow I will bring Tommo, as they call him,by water; they have promised to carry him down to the sea for meearly in the morning, so that there will be no delay.'</p><p> 'No, no,' said Toby desperately, 'I will not leave him that way;we must escape together.'</p><p> 'Then there is no hope for you,' exclaimed the sailor, 'for if Ileave you here on the beach, as soon as I am gone you will becarried back into the valley, and then neither of you will everlook upon the sea again.'&nbsp;&nbsp;And with many oaths he swore that ifhe would only go to Nukuheva with him that day, he would be sureto have me there the very next morning.</p><p> 'But how do you know they will bring him down to the beachtomorrow, when they will not do so today?'&nbsp;&nbsp;said Toby.&nbsp;&nbsp;But thesailor had many reasons, all of which were so mixed up with themysterious customs of the islanders, that he was none the wiser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, their conduct, especially in preventing him fromreturning into the valley, was absolutely unaccountable to him;and added to everything else, was the bitter reflection, that theold sailor, after all, might possibly be deceiving him.&nbsp;&nbsp;And thenagain he had to think of me, left alone with the natives, and byno means well.&nbsp;&nbsp;If he went with Jimmy, he might at least hope toprocure some relief for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;But might not the savages who hadacted so strangely, hurry me off somewhere before his return?Then, even if he remained, perhaps they would not let him go backinto the valley where I was.</p><p> Thus perplexed was my poor comrade; he knew not what to do, andhis courageous spirit was of no use to him now.&nbsp;&nbsp;There he was,all by himself, seated upon the broken canoe--the natives groupedaround him at a distance, and eyeing him more and more fixedly.'It is getting late: said Jimmy, who was standing behind therest.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nukuheva is far off, and I cannot cross the Happarcountry by night.&nbsp;&nbsp;You see how it is;--if you come along withme,.&nbsp;&nbsp;all will be well; if you do not, depend upon it, neither ofyou will ever escape.'</p><p> 'There is no help for it,' said Toby, at last, with a heavyheart, 'I will have to trust you,' and he came out from theshadow of the little shrine, and cast a long look up the valley.</p><p> 'Now keep close to my side,' said the sailor, 'and let us bemoving quickly.'&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinor and Fayaway here appeared; thekindhearted old woman embracing Toby's knees, and giving way to aflood of tears; while Fayaway, hardly less moved, spoke some fewwords of English she had learned, and held up three fingersbefore him--in so many days he would return.</p><p> At last Jimmy pulled Toby out of the crowd, and after calling toa young Typee who was standing by with a young pig in his arms,all three started for the mountains.</p><p> 'I have told them that you are coming back again,' said the oldfellow, laughing, as they began the ascent, 'but they'll have towait a long time.'&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby turned, and saw the natives all inmotion--the girls waving their tappas in adieu, and the men theirspears.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the last figure entered the grove with one armraised, and the three fingers spread, his heart smote him.</p><p> As the natives had at last consented to his going, it might havebeen, that some of them, at least, really counted upon his speedyreturn; probably supposing, as indeed he had told them when theywere coming down the valley, that his only object in leaving themwas to procure the medicines I needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Jimmy also musthave told them.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they had done before, when my comrade, tooblige me, started on his perilous journey to Nukuheva, theylooked upon me, in his absence, as one of two inseparable friendswho was a sure guaranty for the other's return.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only myown supposition, however, for as to all their strange conduct, itis still a mystery.</p><p> 'You see what sort of a taboo man I am,' said the sailor, afterfor some time silently following the path which led up themountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mow-Mow made me a present of this pig here, and theman who carries it will go right through Happar, and down intoNukuheva with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as he stays by me he is safe, and justso it will be with you, and tomorrow with Tommo.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheer up, then,and rely upon me, you will see him in the morning.'</p><p> The ascent of the mountain was not very difficult, owing to itsbeing near to the sea, where the island ridges are comparativelylow; the path, too, was a fine one, so that in a short time allthree were standing on the summit with the two valleys at theirfeet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The white cascade marking the green head of the Typeevalley first caught Toby's eye; Marheyo's house could easily betraced by them.</p><p> As Jimmy led the way along the ridge, Toby observed that thevalley of the Happars did not extend near so far inland as thatof the Typees.&nbsp;&nbsp;This accounted for our mistake in entering thelatter valley as we had.</p><p> A path leading down from the mountain was soon seen, and,following it, the party were in a short time fairly in the Happarvalley.</p><p> 'Now,' said Jimmy, as they hurried on, 'we taboo men have wivesin all the bays, and I am going to show you the two I have here.'</p><p> So, when they came to the house where he said they lived,--whichwas close by the base of the mountain in a shady nook among thegroves--he went in, and was quite furious at finding itempty--the ladies, had gone out.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they soon made theirappearance, and to tell the truth, welcomed Jimmy quitecordially, as well as Toby, about whom they were veryinquisitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, as the report of their arrivalspread, and the Happars began to assemble, it became evident thatthe appearance of a white stranger among them was not by anymeans deemed so wonderful an event as in the neighbouring valley.</p><p> The old sailor now bade his wives prepare something to eat, as hemust be in Nukuheva before dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;A meal of fish, bread-fruit,and bananas, was accordingly served up, the party regalingthemselves on the mats, in the midst of a numerous company.</p><p> The Happars put many questions to Jimmy about Toby; and Tobyhimself looked sharply at them, anxious to recognize the fellowwho gave him the wound from which he was still suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp;Butthis fiery gentleman, so handy with his spear, had the delicacy,it seemed, to keep out of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly the sight of him wouldnot have been any added inducement to making a stay in thevalley,--some of the afternoon loungers in Happar having politelyurged Toby to spend a few days with them,--there was a feastcoming on.&nbsp;&nbsp;He, however, declined.</p><p> All this while the young Typee stuck to Jimmy like his shadow,and though as lively a dog as any of his tribe, he was now asmeek as a lamb, never opening his mouth except to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Althoughsome of the Happars looked queerly at him, others were morecivil, and seemed desirous of taking him abroad and showing himthe valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Typee was not to be cajoled in that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;How many yards he would have to remove from Jimmy before thetaboo would be powerless, it would be hard to tell, but probablyhe himself knew to a fraction.</p><p> On the promise of a red cotton handkerchief, and something elsewhich he kept secret, this poor fellow had undertaken a ratherticklish journey, though, as far as Toby could ascertain, it wassomething that had never happened before.</p><p> The island-punch--arva--was brought in at the conclusion of therepast, and passed round in a shallow calabash.</p><p> Now my comrade, while seated in the Happar house, began to feelmore troubled than ever at leaving me; indeed, so sad did he feelthat he talked about going back to the valley, and wanted Jimmyto escort him as far as the mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sailor would notlisten to him, and, by way of diverting his thoughts, pressed himto drink of the arva.&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing its narcotic nature, he refused;but Jimmy said he would have something mixed with it, which wouldconvert it into an innocent beverage that would inspirit them forthe rest of their journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;So at last he was induced to drink ofit, and its effects were just as the sailor had predicted; hisspirits rose at once, and all his gloomy thoughts left him.</p><p> The old rover now began to reveal his true character, though hewas hardly suspected at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;'If I get you off to a ship,'said he, 'you will surely give a poor fellow something for savingyou.'&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, before they left the house, he made Toby promisethat he would give him five Spanish dollars if he succeeded ingetting any part of his wages advanced from the vessel, aboard ofwhich they were going; Toby, moreover, engaging to reward himstill further, as soon as my deliverance was accomplished.</p><p> A little while after this they started again, accompanied by manyof the natives, and going up the valley, took a steep path nearits head, which led to Nukuheva.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the Happars paused andwatched them as they ascended the mountain, one group ofbandit-looking fellows, shaking their spears and castingthreatening glances at the poor Typee, whose heart as well asheels seemed much the lighter when he came to look down uponthem.</p><p> On gaining the heights once more, their way led for a time alongseveral ridges covered with enormous ferns.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last they enteredupon a wooded tract, and here they overtook a party of Nukuhevanatives, well armed, and carrying bundles of long poles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmyseemed to know them all very well, and stopped for a while, andhad a talk about the 'Wee-Wees', as the people of Nukuheva callthe Monsieurs.</p><p> The party with the poles were King Mowanna's men, and by hisorders they had been gathering them in the ravines for his alliesthe French.</p><p> Leaving these fellows to trudge on with their loads, Toby and hiscompanions now pushed forward again, as the sun was already lowin the west.&nbsp;&nbsp;They came upon the valleys of Nukuheva on one sideof the bay, where the highlands slope off into the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Themen-of-war were still lying in the harbour, and as Toby lookeddown upon them, the strange events which had happened sorecently, seemed all a dream.</p><p> They soon descended towards the beach, and found themselves inJimmy's house before it was well dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here he received anotherwelcome from his Nukuheva wives, and after some refreshments inthe shape of cocoanut milk and poee-poee, they entered a canoe(the Typee of course going along) and paddled off to a whaleshipwhich was anchored near the shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the vessel in wantof men.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own had sailed some time before.&nbsp;&nbsp;The captainprofessed great pleasure at seeing Toby, but thought from hisexhausted appearance that he must be unfit for duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, heagreed to ship him, as well as his comrade, as soon as he shouldarrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby begged hard for an armed boat, in which to go roundto Typee and rescue me, notwithstanding the promises of Jimmy.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this the captain would not hear of, and told him to havepatience, for the sailor would be faithful to his word.&nbsp;&nbsp;When,too, he demanded the five silver dollars for Jimmy, the captainwas unwilling to give them.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Toby insisted upon it, as he nowbegan to think that Jimmy might be a mere mercenary, who would besure to prove faithless if not well paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly he notonly gave him the money, but took care to assure him, over andover again, that as soon as he brought me aboard he would receivea still larger sum.</p><p> Before sun-rise the next day, Jimmy and the Typee started in twoof the ship's boats, which were manned by tabooed natives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby,of course, was all eagerness to go along, but the sailor told himthat if he did, it would spoil all; so, hard as it was, he wasobliged to remain.</p><p> Towards evening he was on the watch, and descried the boatsturning the headland and entering the bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;He strained his eyes,and thought he saw me; but I was not there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending from themast almost distracted, he grappled Jimmy as he struck the deck,shouting in a voice that startled him, 'Where is Tommo?'&nbsp;&nbsp;The oldfellow faltered, but soon recovering, did all he could to soothehim, assuring him that it had proved to be impossible to get medown to the shore that morning; assigning many plausible reasons,and adding that early on the morrow he was going to visit the bayagain in a French boat, when, if he did not find me on thebeach--as this time he certainly expected to--he would marchright back into the valley, and carry me away at all hazards.&nbsp;&nbsp;He, however, again refused to allow Toby to accompany him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now,situated as Toby was, his sole dependence for the present wasupon this Jimmy, and therefore he was fain to comfort himself aswell as he could with what the old sailor told him.&nbsp;&nbsp;The nextmorning, however, he had the satisfaction of seeing the Frenchboat start with Jimmy in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, then, I will see him,thought Toby; but many a long day passed before he ever saw Tommoagain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly was the boat out of sight, when the captain cameforward and ordered the anchor weighed; he was going to sea.</p><p> Vain were all Toby's ravings--they were disregarded; and when hecame to himself, the sails were set, and the ship fast leavingthe land.</p><p> .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. 'Oh!'&nbsp;&nbsp;said he to me at our meeting, 'what sleeplessnights were mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often I started from my hammock, dreaming youwere before me, and upbraiding me for leaving you on the island.'</p><p> .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p><p> There is little more to be related.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby left this vessel at NewZealand, and after some further adventures, arrived home in lessthan two years after leaving the Marquesas.&nbsp;&nbsp;He always thought ofme as dead--and I had every reason to suppose that he too was nomore; but a strange meeting was in store for us, one which madeToby's heart all the lighter.</p><p> NOTE.</p><p> The author was more than two years in the South Seas, afterescaping from the valley, as recounted in the last chapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime after returning home the foregoing narrative was published,though it was little thought at the time that this would be themeans of revealing the existance of Toby, who had long been givenup for lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;But so it proved.</p><p> The story of his escape supplies a natural sequel to theadventure, and as such it is now added to the volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasrelated to the author by Toby himself, not ten days since.</p><p> New York, July, 1846.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"NAHANT, September 8, 1880,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four o'clock in the morning."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four by the clock! and yet not day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the great world rolls and wheels away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its cities on land, and its ships at sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the dawn that is to be!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the lamp in the anchored bark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends its glimmer across the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heavy breathing of the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the only sound that comes to me.

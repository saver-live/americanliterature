<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Sir Christopher Gardiner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight of the Holy Sepulchre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Merry England over the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stepped upon this continent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if his august presence lent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glory to the colony.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have seen him in the street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the little Boston of Winthrop's time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His rapier dangling at his feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doublet and hose and boots complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Rupert hat with ostrich plume,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloves that exhaled a faint perfume,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxuriant curls and air sublime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And superior manners now obsolete!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a way of saying things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made one think of courts and kings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lords and ladies of high degree;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that not having been at court
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed something very little short
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of treason or lese-majesty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an accomplished knight was he.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dwelling was just beyond the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At what he called his country-seat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, careless of Fortune's smile or frown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weary grown of the world and its ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wished to pass the rest of his days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a private life and a calm retreat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a double life was the life he led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, while professing to be in search
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a godly course, and willing, he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, anxious to join the Puritan church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made of all this but small account,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed his idle hours instead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With roystering Morton of Merry Mount,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pettifogger from Furnival's Inn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of misrule and riot and sin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who looked on the wine when it was red.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This country-seat was little more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than a cabin of log's; but in front of the door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A modest flower-bed thickly sown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sweet alyssum and columbine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made those who saw it at once divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The touch of some other hand than his own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first it was whispered, and then it was known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he in secret was harboring there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little lady with golden hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he called his cousin, but whom he had wed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Italian manner, as men said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And great was the scandal everywhere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But worse than this was the vague surmise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though none could vouch for it or aver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Knight of the Holy Sepulchre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was only a Papist in disguise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the more to imbitter their bitter lives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the more to trouble the public mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came letters from England, from two other wives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he had carelessly left behind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of them letters of such a kind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As made the governor hold his breath;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one imploring him straight to send
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The husband home, that he might amend;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other asking his instant death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the only way to make an end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wary governor deemed it right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all this wickedness was revealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To send his warrant signed and sealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take the body of the knight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with this mighty instrument,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal, mounting his gallant steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode forth from town at the top of his speed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And followed by all his bailiffs bold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if on high achievement bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To storm some castle or stronghold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenge the warders on the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seize in his ancestral hall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A robber-baron grim and old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when though all the dust and heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to Sir Christopher's country-seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No knight he found, nor warder there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the little lady with golden hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was gathering in the bright sunshine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet alyssum and columbine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While gallant Sir Christopher, all so gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being forewarned, through the postern gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his castle wall had tripped away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was keeping a little holiday
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forests, that bounded his estate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as a trusty squire and true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal searched the castle through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not crediting what the lady said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searched from cellar to garret in vain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, finding no knight, came out again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And arrested the golden damsel instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore her in triumph into the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from her eyes the tears rolled down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sweet alyssum and columbine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she held in her fingers white and fine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor's heart was moved to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fair a creature caught within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snares of Satan and of sin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he read her a little homily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the folly and wickedness of the lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of women, half cousins and half wives;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, seeing that naught his words availed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent her away in a ship that sailed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Merry England over the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the other two wives in the old countree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To search her further, since he had failed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come at the heart of the mystery.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Sir Christopher wandered away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through pathless woods for a month and a day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shooting pigeons, and sleeping at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the noble savage, who took delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his feathered hat and his velvet vest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gun and his rapier and the rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as soon as the noble savage heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a bounty was offered for this gay bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to slay him out of hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring in his beautiful scalp for a show,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the glossy head of a kite or crow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he was made to understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wanted the bird alive, not dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he followed him whithersoever he fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through forest and field, and hunted him down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brought him prisoner into the town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! it was a rueful sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see this melancholy knight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a dismal and hapless case;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hat deformed by stain and dent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plumage broken, his doublet rent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beard and flowing locks forlorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matted, dishevelled, and unshorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His boots with dust and mire besprent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dignified in his disgrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wearing an unblushing face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus before the magistrate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood to hear the doom of fate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain he strove with wonted ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To modify and extenuate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His evil deeds in church and state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For gone was now his power to please;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his pompous words had no more weight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than feathers flying in the breeze.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With suavity equal to his own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor lent a patient ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the speech evasive and highflown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which he endeavored to make clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That colonial laws were too severe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When applied to a gallant cavalier,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentleman born, and so well known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And accustomed to move in a higher sphere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this the Puritan governor heard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deigned in answer never a word;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in summary manner shipped away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a vessel that sailed from Salem bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This splendid and famous cavalier,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his Rupert hat and his popery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Merry England over the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As being unmeet to inhabit here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus endeth the Rhyme of Sir Christopher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight of the Holy Sepulchre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first who furnished this barren land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With apples of Sodom and ropes of sand.

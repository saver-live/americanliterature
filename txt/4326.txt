<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one who has been long in city pent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis very sweet to look into the fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And open face of heaven to breathe a prayer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full in the smile of the blue firmament.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is more happy, when, with heart's content,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gentle tale of love and languishment?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning home at evening, with an ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catching the notes of Philomel, an eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mourns that day so soon has glided by:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en like the passage of an angel's tear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That falls through the clear ether silently.

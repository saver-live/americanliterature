<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, I am not the first,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have willed more mischief than they durst:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in the breathless night I too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shiver now, 'tis nothing new.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than I, if truth were told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have stood and sweated hot and cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through their reins in ice and fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear contended with desire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agued once like me were they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I like them shall win my way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly to the bed of mould
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there's neither heat nor cold.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from my grave across my brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plays no wind of healing now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fire and ice within me fight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the suffocating night.

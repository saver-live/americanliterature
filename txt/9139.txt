<p><cite class="al-title">Lyrical Ballads, With a Few Other Poems</cite> was published by both Wordsworth and <a href="/author/samuel-taylor-coleridge/bio-books-stories">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> in 1798, ushering in the <a href="/romanticism-study-guide">Romantic Movement</a> of English literature. We have listed the work under Wordsworth by function of his name as first-listed in publication credits. Both authors published many of these works individually, many of which we offer separately under the respective author (such as Coleridge's <a href="/author/samuel-taylor-coleridge/poem/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>). Because of <cite class="al-title">Lyrical Ballads</cite>' significance in literature, we thought it was important to provide the complete collection here. Excerpt of the editor's preface ("Advertisement"), we thought it was an amusing way to usher in this new era in literature: <br><i>"Readers of superior judgment may disapprove of the style in which many of these pieces are executed, it must be expected that many lines and phrases will not exactly suit their taste. It will perhaps appear to them, that wishing to avoid the prevalent fault of the day, the author has sometimes descended too low, and that many of his expressions are too familiar, and not of sufficient dignity. It is apprehended, that the more conversant the reader is with our elder writers, and with those in modern times who have been the most successful in painting manners and passions, the fewer complaints of this kind will he have to make."</i></p><p><img alt="Lyrical Ballads: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" title="Lyrical Ballads: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Rime off the Ancyent Marinere" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/poem/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner.jpg" style="max-width:400px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="2338605444" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p><p><a href="the-rime-of-the-ancyent-marinere-in-seven-parts">The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere: In Seven Parts</a></p><p><a href="the-foster-mothers-tale-a-dramatic-fragment">The Foster-Mother's Tale, A Dramatic Fragment</a></p><p><a href="lines-left-upon-a-seat-in-a-yew-tree-which-stands-near-the-lake-of-esthwaite">Lines Left Upon a Seat in a Yew-Tree Which Stands Near the Lake of Esthwaite</a></p><p><a href="the-nightingale-a-conversational-poem-written-in-april-1798">The Nightingale; A Conversational Poem, Written in April, 1798</a></p><p><a href="the-female-vagarant">The Female Vagarant</a></p><p><a href="goody-blake-and-harry-gill-a-true-story">Goody Blake, and Harry Gill, A True Story</a></p><p><a href="lines-written-a-small-distance-from-my-house-and-sent-by-my-little-boy">Lines Written a Small Distance from My House, and Sent by My Little Boy</a></p><p><a href="simon-lee-the-old-huntsman">Simon Lee, The Old Huntsman</a></p><p><a href="anecdote-for-fathers-shewing-how-the-art-of-lying-may-be-taught">Anecdote for Fathers Shewing How the Art of Lying May Be Taught</a></p><p><a href="we-are-seven">We Are Seven</a></p><p><a href="lines-written-in-early-spring">Lines Written in Early Spring</a></p><p><a href="the-thorn">The Thorn</a></p><p><a href="the-last-of-the-flock">The Last of the Flock</a></p><p><a href="the-dungeon">The Dungeon</a></p><p><a href="the-mad-mother">The Mad Mother</a></p><p><a href="the-idiot-boy">The Idiot Boy</a></p><p><a href="lines-written-near-richmond-upon-the-thames-at-evening">Lines Written Near Richmond, Upon the Thames, At Evening</a></p><p><a href="expostulation-and-reply">Expostulation and Reply</a></p><p><a href="the-tables-turned-an-evening-scene-on-the-same-subject">The Tables Turned; An Evening Scene, On the Same Subject</a></p><p><a href="old-man-travelling-animal-tranquillity-and-decay-a-sketch">Old Man Travelling; Animal Tranquillity, and Decay, A Sketch</a></p><p><a href="the-complaint-of-a-forsaken-indian-woman">The Complaint of a Forsaken Indian Woman</a></p><p><a href="the-convict">The Convict</a></p><p><a href="lines-written-a-few-miles-from-tintern-abbey-on-revisiting-the-banks-of-the-wye">Lines Written a Few Miles from Tintern Abbey, On Revisiting the Banks of the Wye</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/william-wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> library. </p>

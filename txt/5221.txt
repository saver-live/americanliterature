How have I wandered here to this vaulted room
In the house of life?—the floor was ruffled with gold
Last evening, and she who was softly in bloom,
Glimmered as flowers that in perfume at twilight
    unfold
For the flush of the night; whereas now the gloom
Of every dirty, must-besprinkled mould,
And damp old web of misery's heirloom
Deadens this day's grey-dropping arras-fold.
And what is this that floats on the undermist
Of the mirror towards the dusty grate, as if feeling
Unsightly its way to the warmth?—this thing with
    a list
To the left? this ghost like a candle swealing?
Pale-blurred, with two round black drops, as if it
    missed
Itself among everything else, here hungrily stealing
Upon me!—my own reflection!—explicit gist
Of my presence there in the mirror that leans from
    the ceiling!
Then will somebody square this shade with the
    being I know
I was last night, when my soul rang clear as a bell
And happy as rain in summer? Why should it be
    so?
What is there gone against me, why am I in hell?

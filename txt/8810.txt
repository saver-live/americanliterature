<p><b>I</b><br> A THIN moon faints in the sky o'erhead,<br> And dumb in the churchyard lie the dead.<br> Walk we not, Sweet, by garden ways,<br> Where the late rose hangs and the phlox delays,<br> But forth of the gate and down the road,<br> Past the church and the yews, to their dim abode.<br> For it's turn of the year and All Souls' night,<br> When the dead can hear and the dead have sight.<br> <br> <b>II</b><br> Fear not that sound like wind in the trees:<br> It is only their call that comes on the breeze;<br> Fear not the shudder that seems to pass:<br> It is only the tread of their feet on the grass;<br> Fear not the drip of the bough as you stoop:<br> It is only the touch of their hands that grope--<br> For the year's on the turn and it's All Souls' night,<br> When the dead can yearn and the dead can smite.<br> <br> <b>III</b><br> And where should a man bring his sweet to woo<br> But here, where such hundreds were lovers too?<br> Where lie the dead lips that thirst to kiss,<br> The empty hands that their fellows miss,<br> Where the maid and her lover, from sere to green,<br> Sleep bed by bed, with the worm between?<br> For it's turn of the year and All Souls' night,<br> When the dead can hear and the dead have sight.<br> <br> <b>IV</b><br> And now they rise and walk in the cold,<br> Let us warm their blood and give youth to the old.<br> Let them see us and hear us, and say: "Ah, thus<br> In the prime of the year it went with us!"<br> Till their lips drawn close, and so long unkist,<br> Forget they are mist that mingles with mist!<br> For the year's on the turn, and it's All Souls' night,<br> When the dead can burn and the dead can smite.<br> <br> <b>V</b><br> Till they say, as they hear us--poor dead, poor dead!--<br> "Just an hour of this, and our age-long bed--<br> Just a thrill of the old remembered pains<br> To kindle a flame in our frozen veins,<br> A touch, and a sight, and a floating apart,<br> As the chill of dawn strikes each phantom heart--<br> For it's turn of the year and All Souls' night,<br> When the dead can hear and the dead have sight."<br> <br> <b>VI</b><br> And where should the living feel alive<br> But here in this wan white humming hive,<br> As the moon wastes down, and the dawn turns cold,<br> And one by one they creep back to the fold?<br> And where should a man hold his mate and say:<br> "One more, one more, ere we go their way"?<br> For the year's on the turn, and it's All Souls' night,<br> When the living can learn by the churchyard light.<br> <br> <b>VII</b><br> And how should we break faith who have seen<br> Those dead lips plight with the mist between,<br> And how forget, who have seen how soon<br> They lie thus chambered and cold to the moon?<br> How scorn, how hate, how strive, wee too,<br> Who must do so soon as those others do?<br> For it's All Souls' night, and break of the day,<br> And behold, with the light the dead are away. . .</p>

Sadly I walk'd within the field,
     To see what comfort it would yield;
     And as I went my private way,
     An olive-branch before me lay;
     And seeing it, I made a stay,
     And took it up, and view'd it; then
     Kissing the omen, said Amen;
     Be, be it so, and let this be
     A divination unto me;
     That in short time my woes shall cease,
     And love shall crown my end with peace.

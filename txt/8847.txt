<p>WE women want to many things;<br> And first we call for happiness, --<br> The careless boon the hour brings,<br> The smile, the song, and the caress.<br> <br> And when the fancy fades, we cry,<br> Nay, give us one on whom to spend<br> Our heart's desire! When Love goes by<br> With folded wings, we seek a friend.<br> <br> And then our children come, to prove<br> Our hearts but slumbered, and can wake;<br> And when they go, we're fain to love<br> Some other woman's for their sake.<br> <br> But when both love and friendship fail,<br> We cry for duty, work to do;<br> Some end to gain beyond the pale<br> Of self, some height to journey to.<br> <br> And then, before our task is done,<br> With sudden weariness oppressed,<br> We leave the shining goal unwon<br> And only ask for rest.</p>

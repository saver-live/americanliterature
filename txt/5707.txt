<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sir, I should build me a fortification, if I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to live here." --BOSWELL'S Johnson.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the green little isle of Inchkenneth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is it that walks by the shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So gay with his Highland blue bonnet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So brave with his targe and claymore?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His form is the form of a giant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his face wears an aspect of pain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can this be the Laird of Inchkenneth?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can this be Sir Allan McLean?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, no!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only the Rambler,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Idler, who lives in Bolt Court,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who says, were he Laird of Inchkenneth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would wall himself round with a fort.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When summer's end is nighing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And skies at evening cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I muse on change and fortune
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the feats I vowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young and proud.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weathercock at sunset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would lose the slanted ray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would climb the beacon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That looked to Wales away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the last of day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hill and cloud and heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hues of evening died;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night welled through lane and hollow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hushed the countryside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I had youth and pride.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I with earth and nightfall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In converse high would stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late, till the west was ashen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And darkness hard at hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the eye lost the land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year might age, and cloudy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessening day might close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But air of other summers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed from beyond the snows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I had hope of those.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came and were and are not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And come no more anew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the years and seasons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever can ensue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must now be worse and few.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here's an end of roaming
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On eves when autumn nighs:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear too fondly listens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For summer's parting sighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the heart replies.

<pre>1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Meg she was a gypsy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And liv'd upon the moors:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her bed it was the brown heath turf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her house was out of doors.

2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her apples were swart blackberries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her currants, pods o' broom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wine was dew of the wild white rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her book a church-yard tomb.

3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brothers were the craggy hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sisters larchen trees;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone with her great family
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She liv'd as she did please.

4.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No breakfast had she many a morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No dinner many a noon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'stead of supper she would stare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full hard against the moon.

5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every morn, of woodbine fresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made her garlanding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every night the dark glen yew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wove, and she would sing.

6.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with her fingers old and brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She plaited mats o' rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave them to the cottagers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She met among the bushes.

7.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tall as Amazon:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old red blanket cloak she wore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chip hat had she on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God rest her aged bones somewhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She died full long agone!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had some friends, but I dreamed that they were dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who used to dance with lanterns round a little boy in bed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green and white lanterns that waved to and fro:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I havent seen a Firefly since ever so long ago!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had some friends, their crowns were in the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who used to nod and whisper when a little boy went by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the nuts began to tumble and the breeze began to blow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I havent seen a Cocoa-palm since ever so long ago!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a friend, he came up from Cape Horn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a Coal-sack on his shoulder when a little boy was born.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard me learn to talk, and he helped me thrive and grow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I havent seen the Southern Cross since ever so long ago!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a boat, I out and let her drive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I found my dream was foolish, for my friends were all alive.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cocoa-palms were real, and the Southern Cross was true:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Fireflies were dancing, so I danced too!

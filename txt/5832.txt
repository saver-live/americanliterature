<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PART FIRST

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRELUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE WAYSIDE INN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Autumn night, in Sudbury town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the meadows bare and brown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows of the wayside inn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed red with fire-light through the leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of woodbine, hanging from the eaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their crimson curtains rent and thin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ancient is this hostelry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any in the land may be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built in the old Colonial day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When men lived in a grander way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ampler hospitality;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now somewhat fallen to decay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With weather-stains upon the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stairways worn, and crazy doors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And creaking and uneven floors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chimneys huge, and tiled and tall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A region of repose it seems,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place of slumber and of dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote among the wooded hills!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there no noisy railway speeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its torch-race scattering smoke and gleeds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But noon and night, the panting teams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop under the great oaks, that throw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangles of light and shade below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On roofs and doors and window-sills.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the road the barns display
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lines of stalls, their mows of hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the wide doors the breezes blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wattled cocks strut to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, half effaced by rain and shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Horse prances on the sign.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round this old-fashioned, quaint abode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep silence reigned, save when a gust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went rushing down the county road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And skeletons of leaves, and dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment quickened by its breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuddered and danced their dance of death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the ancient oaks o'erhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious voices moaned and fled.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the parlor of the inn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasant murmur smote the ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like water rushing through a weir:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft interrupted by the din
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of laughter and of loud applause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in each intervening pause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of a violin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire-light, shedding over all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendor of its ruddy glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the whole parlor large and low;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gleamed on wainscot and on wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It touched with more than wonted grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Princess Mary's pictured face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bronzed the rafters overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the old spinet's ivory keys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It played inaudible melodies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It crowned the sombre clock with flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands, the hours, the maker's name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And painted with a livelier red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord's coat-of-arms again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, flashing on the window-pane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emblazoned with its light and shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jovial rhymes, that still remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ near a century ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the great Major Molineaux,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom Hawthorne has immortal made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the blazing fire of wood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erect the rapt musician stood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever and anon he bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head upon his instrument,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seemed to listen, till he caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confessions of its secret thought,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy, the triumph, the lament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exultation and the pain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, by the magic of his art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He soothed the throbbings of its heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lulled it into peace again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the fireside at their ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There sat a group of friends, entranced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the delicious melodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from the far-off noisy town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had to the wayside inn come down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rest beneath its old oak-trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire-light on their faces glanced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadows on the wainscot danced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, though of different lands and speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each had his tale to tell, and each
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was anxious to be pleased and please.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while the sweet musician plays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me in outline sketch them all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance uncouthly as the blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its uncertain touch portrays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadowy semblance on the wall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first the Landlord will I trace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grave in his aspect and attire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of ancient pedigree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Justice of the Peace was he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known in all Sudbury as "The Squire."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud was he of his name and race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of old Sir William and Sir Hugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the parlor, full in view,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His coat-of-arms, well framed and glazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the wall in colors blazed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beareth gules upon his shield,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chevron argent in the field,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With three wolf's heads, and for the crest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Wyvern part-per-pale addressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a helmet barred; below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scroll reads, "By the name of Howe."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over this, no longer bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though glimmering with a latent light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hung the sword his grandsire bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rebellious days of yore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down there at Concord in the fight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth was there, of quiet ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Student of old books and days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom all tongues and lands were known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet a lover of his own;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a social virtue graced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet a friend of solitude;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of such a genial mood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of all things he embraced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet of such fastidious taste,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never found the best too good.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Books were his passion and delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his upper room at home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood many a rare and sumptuous tome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vellum bound, with gold bedight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great volumes garmented in white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling Florence, Pisa, Rome.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved the twilight that surrounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The border-land of old romance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where glitter hauberk, helm, and lance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And banner waves, and trumpet sounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ladies ride with hawk on wrist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mighty warriors sweep along,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magnified by the purple mist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dusk of centuries and of song.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chronicles of Charlemagne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Merlin and the Mort d'Arthure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled together in his brain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tales of Flores and Blanchefleur,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Ferumbras, Sir Eglamour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launcelot, Sir Morgadour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Guy, Sir Bevis, Sir Gawain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young Sicilian, too, was there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sight of Etna born and bred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some breath of its volcanic air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was glowing in his heart and brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, being rebellious to his liege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Palermo's fatal siege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the western seas he fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In good King Bomba's happy reign.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face was like a summer night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All flooded with a dusky light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands were small; his teeth shone white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sea-shells, when he smiled or spoke;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sinews supple and strong as oak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean shaven was he as a priest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who at the mass on Sunday sings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save that upon his upper lip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beard, a good palm's length least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level and pointed at the tip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot sideways, like a swallow's wings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poets read he o'er and o'er,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most of all the Immortal Four
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Italy; and next to those,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story-telling bard of prose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wrote the joyous Tuscan tales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Decameron, that make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiesole's green hills and vales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembered for Boccaccio's sake.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much too of music was his thought;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodies and measures fraught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sunshine and the open air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of vineyards and the singing sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his beloved Sicily;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And much it pleased him to peruse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The songs of the Sicilian muse,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucolic songs by Meli sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the familiar peasant tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made men say, "Behold! once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pitying gods to earth restore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theocritus of Syracuse!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Spanish Jew from Alicant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With aspect grand and grave was there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vender of silks and fabrics rare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And attar of rose from the Levant.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an old Patriarch he appeared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham or Isaac, or at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some later Prophet or High-Priest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lustrous eyes, and olive skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, wildly tossed from cheeks and chin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumbling cataract of his beard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His garments breathed a spicy scent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cinnamon and sandal blent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the soft aromatic gales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That meet the mariner, who sails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Moluccas, and the seas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wash the shores of Celebes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stories that recorded are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Pierre Alphonse he knew by heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was rumored he could say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parables of Sandabar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the Fables of Pilpay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if not all, the greater part!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well versed was he in Hebrew books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talmud and Targum, and the lore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Kabala; and evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a mystery in his looks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes seemed gazing far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if in vision or in trance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the solemn sackbut play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the Jewish maidens dance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Theologian, from the school
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Cambridge on the Charles, was there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skilful alike with tongue and pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He preached to all men everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gospel of the Golden Rule,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Commandment given to men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking the deed, and not the creed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would help us in our utmost need.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reverent feet the earth he trod,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor banished nature from his plan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But studied still with deep research
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build the Universal Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lofty as in the love of God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ample as the wants of man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Poet, too, was there, whose verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was tender, musical, and terse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspiration, the delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gleam, the glory, the swift flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thoughts so sudden, that they seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revelations of a dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these were his; but with them came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No envy of another's fame;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not find his sleep less sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For music in some neighboring street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor rustling hear in every breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laurels of Miltiades.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honor and blessings on his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While living, good report when dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, not too eager for renown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepts, but does not clutch, the crown!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last the Musician, as he stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illumined by that fire of wood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair-haired, blue-eyed, his aspect blithe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure tall and straight and lithe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every feature of his face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revealing his Norwegian race;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A radiance, streaming from within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around his eyes and forehead beamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel with the violin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted by Raphael, he seemed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived in that ideal world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose language is not speech, but song;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around him evermore the throng
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of elves and sprites their dances whirled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stromkarl sang, the cataract hurled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its headlong waters from the height;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mingled in the wild delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of sea-birds in their flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumor of the forest trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plunge of the implacable seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumult of the wind at night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of eld, like trumpets blowing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old ballads, and wild melodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through mist and darkness pouring forth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Elivagar's river flowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the glaciers of the North.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instrument on which he played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was in Cremona's workshops made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a great master of the past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere yet was lost the art divine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashioned of maple and of pine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in Tyrolian forests vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had rocked and wrestled with the blast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exquisite was it in design,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect in each minutest part.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marvel of the lutist's art;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in its hollow chamber, thus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maker from whose hands it came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had written his unrivalled name,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Antonius Stradivarius."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he played, the atmosphere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was filled with magic, and the ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught echoes of that Harp of Gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose music had so weird a sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunted stag forgot to bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaping rivulet backward rolled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds came down from bush and tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead came from beneath the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maiden to the harper's knee!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music ceased; the applause was loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleased musician smiled and bowed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood-fire clapped its hands of flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows on the wainscot stirred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the harpsichord there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ghostly murmur of acclaim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound like that sent down at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By birds of passage in their flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the remotest distance heard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then silence followed; then began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clamor for the Landlord's tale,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story promised them of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said, but always left untold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, although a bashful man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his courage seemed to fail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding excuse of no avail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yielded; and thus the story ran.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE LANDLORD'S TALE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, my children, and you shall hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly a man is now alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who remembers that famous day and year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to his friend, "If the British march
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By land or sea from the town to-night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the North Church tower as a signal light,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, if by land, and two, if by sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I on the opposite shore will be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to ride and spread the alarm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through every Middlesex village and farm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the country folk to be up and to arm,"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, "Good night!" and with muffled oar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the moon rose over the bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Somerset, British man-of-war;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the moon like a prison bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a huge black hulk, that was magnified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its own reflection in the tide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanders and watches with eager ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in the silence around him he hears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muster of men at the barrack door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the measured tread of the grenadiers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marching down to their boats on the shore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the belfry-chamber overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And startled the pigeons from their perch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sombre rafters, that round him made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masses and moving shapes of shade,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the trembling ladder, steep and tall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the highest window in the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he paused to listen and look down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment on the roofs of the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moonlight flowing over all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their night-encampment on the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in silence so deep and still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchful night-wind, as it went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creeping along from tent to tent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment only he feels the spell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a shadowy something far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the river widens to meet the bay,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line of black that bends and floats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he patted his horse's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now gazed at the landscape far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mostly he watched with eager search
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belfry-tower of the Old North Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it rose above the graves on the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second lamp in the belfry burns!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hurry of hoofs in a village street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was all!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, through the gloom and the light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of a nation was riding that night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has left the village and mounted the steep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the alders, that skirt its edge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was twelve by the village clock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the crowing of the cock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the barking of the farmer's dog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt the damp of the river fog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rises after the sun goes down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one by the village clock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he galloped into Lexington.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the gilded weathercock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they already stood aghast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bloody work they would look upon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was two by the village clock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the bleating of the flock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the twitter of birds among the trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt the breath of the morning breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing over the meadows brown.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was safe and asleep in his bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who that day would be lying dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierced by a British musket-ball.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the books you have read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the British Regulars fired and fled,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From behind each fence and farm-yard wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then crossing the fields to emerge again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the trees at the turn of the road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only pausing to fire and load.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through the night rode Paul Revere;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so through the night went his cry of alarm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To every Middlesex village and farm,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cry of defiance and not of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a word that shall echo forevermore!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all our history, to the last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people will waken and listen to hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the midnight message of Paul Revere.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord ended thus his tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rising took down from its nail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword that hung there, dim with dust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cleaving to its sheath with rust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "This sword was in the fight."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet seized it, and exclaimed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the sword of a good knight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though homespun was his coat-of-mail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter if it be not named
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyeuse, Colada, Durindale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excalibar, or Aroundight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or other name the books record?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ancestor, who bore this sword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Colonel of the Volunteers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounted upon his old gray mare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen here and there and everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me a grander shape appears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than old Sir William, or what not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinking about in foreign lands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With iron gauntlets on his hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on his head an iron pot!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All laughed; the Landlord's face grew red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his escutcheon on the wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not comprehend at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drift of what the Poet said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who had been longest dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were always greatest in his eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be was speechless with surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see Sir William's plumed head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought to a level with the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made the subject of a jest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this perceiving, to appease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord's wrath, the others' fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student said, with careless ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ladies and the cavaliers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arms, the loves, the courtesies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deeds of high emprise, I sing!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Ariosto says, in words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have the stately stride and ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of armed knights and clashing swords.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now listen to the tale I bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen! though not to me belong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing draperies of his song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words that rouse, the voice that charms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord's tale was one of arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a tale of love is mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blending the human and divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale of the Decameron, told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Palmieri's garden old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Fiametta, laurel-crowned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While her companions lay around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard the intermingled sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of airs that on their errands sped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wild birds gossiping overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lisp of leaves, and fountain's fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her own voice more sweet than all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling the tale, which, wanting these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance may lose its power to please."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE STUDENT'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One summer morning, when the sun was hot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary with labor in his garden-plot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a rude bench beneath his cottage eaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo sat among the leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a huge vine, that, with its arms outspread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung its delicious clusters overhead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below him, through the lovely valley flowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river Arno, like a winding road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from its banks were lifted high in air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spires and roofs of Florence called the Fair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him a marble tomb, that rose above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wasted fortunes and his buried love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there, in banquet and in tournament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wealth had lavished been, his substance spent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To woo and lose, since ill his wooing sped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna, who his rival wed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet ever in his fancy reigned supreme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal woman of a young man's dream.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he withdrew, in poverty and pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this small farm, the last of his domain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only comfort and his only care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prune his vines, and plant the fig and pear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only forester and only guest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His falcon, faithful to him, when the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose willing hands had found so light of yore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brazen knocker of his palace door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had now no strength to lift the wooden latch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companion of his solitary ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purveyor of his feasts on holidays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On him this melancholy man bestowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love with which his nature overflowed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the empty-handed years went round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacant, though voiceful with prophetic sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, that summer morn, he sat and mused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With folded, patient hands, as he was used,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreamily before his half-closed sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated the vision of his lost delight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him, motionless, the drowsy bird
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamed of the chase, and in his slumber heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden, scythe-like sweep of wings, that dare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headlong plunge thro' eddying gulfs of air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, starting broad awake upon his perch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinkled his bells, like mass-bells in a church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, looking at his master, seemed to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ser Federigo, shall we hunt to-day?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo thought not of the chase;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tender vision of her lovely face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not say he seems to see, he sees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the leaf-shadows of the trellises,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself, yet not herself; a lovely child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flowing tresses, and eyes wide and wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming undaunted up the garden walk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking not at him, but at the hawk.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful falcon!" said he, "would that I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might hold thee on my wrist, or see thee fly!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice was hers, and made strange echoes start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the haunted chambers of his heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aeolian harp through gusty doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some old ruin its wild music pours.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is thy mother, my fair boy?" he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand laid softly on that shining head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monna Giovanna.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you let me stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while, and with your falcon play?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live there, just beyond your garden wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great house behind the poplars tall."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he spake on; and Federigo heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from afar each softly uttered word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drifted onward through the golden gleams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shadows of the misty sea of dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mariners becalmed through vapors drift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel the sea beneath them sink and lift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear far off the mournful breakers roar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And voices calling faintly from the shore!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, waking from his pleasant reveries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the little boy upon his knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told him stories of his gallant bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in their friendship he became a third.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna, widowed in her prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had come with friends to pass the summer time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her grand villa, half-way up the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erlooking Florence, but retired and still;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With iron gates, that opened through long lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sacred ilex and centennial pines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And terraced gardens, and broad steps of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sylvan deities, with moss o'ergrown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fountains palpitating in the heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all Val d'Arno stretched beneath its feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in seclusion, as a widow may,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely lady whiled the hours away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pacing in sable robes the statued hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself the stateliest statue among all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing more and more, with secret joy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband risen and living in her boy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the lost sense of life returned again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as delight, but as relief from pain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the boy, rejoicing in his strength,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stormed down the terraces from length to length;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming peacock chased in hot pursuit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And climbed the garden trellises for fruit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his chief pastime was to watch the flight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a gerfalcon, soaring into sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the trees that fringed the garden wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then downward stooping at some distant call;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he gazed full often wondered he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who might the master of the falcon be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until that happy morning, when he found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master and falcon in the cottage ground.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now a shadow and a terror fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the great house, as if a passing-bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolled from the tower, and filled each spacious room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With secret awe, and preternatural gloom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petted boy grew ill, and day by day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pined with mysterious malady away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's heart would not be comforted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her darling seemed to her already dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And often, sitting by the sufferer's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do to comfort thee?" she cried.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first the silent lips made no reply,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But moved at length by her importunate cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me," he answered, with imploring tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ser Federigo's falcon for my own!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answer could the astonished mother make;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could she ask, e'en for her darling's sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such favor at a luckless lover's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well knowing that to ask was to command?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well knowing, what all falconers confessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the land that falcon was the best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master's pride and passion and delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sole pursuivant of this poor knight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet, for her child's sake, she could no less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than give assent to soothe his restlessness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So promised, and then promising to keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her promise sacred, saw him fall asleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morrow was a bright September morn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth was beautiful as if new-born;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was that nameless splendor everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wild exhilaration in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes the passers in the city street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulate each other as they meet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two lovely ladies, clothed in cloak and hood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed through the garden gate into the wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the lustrous leaves, and through the sheen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dewy sunshine showering down between.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one, close-hooded, had the attractive grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which sorrow sometimes lends a woman's face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dark eyes moistened with the mists that roll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gulf-stream of passion in the soul;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other with her hood thrown back, her hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a golden glory in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cheeks suffused with an auroral blush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her young heart singing louder than the thrush.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So walked, that morn, through mingled light and shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each by the other's presence lovelier made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna and her bosom friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intent upon their errand and its end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found Ser Federigo at his toil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like banished Adam, delving in the soil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he looked and these fair women spied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden suddenly was glorified;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His long-lost Eden was restored again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strange river winding through the plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer was the Arno to his eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Euphrates watering Paradise!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna raised her stately head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with fair words of salutation said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ser Federigo, we come here as friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping in this to make some poor amends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For past unkindness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I who ne'er before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would even cross the threshold of your door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I who in happier days such pride maintained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refused your banquets, and your gifts disdained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning come, a self-invited guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put your generous nature to the test,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breakfast with you under your own vine."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which he answered: "Poor desert of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not your unkindness call it, for if aught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is good in me of feeling or of thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From you it comes, and this last grace outweighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sorrows, all regrets of other days."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after further compliment and talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the asters in the garden walk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left his guests; and to his cottage turned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he entered for a moment yearned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lost splendors of the days of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruby glass, the silver and the gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt how piercing is the sting of pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By want embittered and intensified.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked about him for some means or way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep this unexpected holiday;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searched every cupboard, and then searched again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned the maid, who came, but came in vain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Signor did not hunt to-day," she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's nothing in the house but wine and bread."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly the drowsy falcon shook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His little bells, with that sagacious look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which said, as plain as language to the ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If anything is wanting, I am here!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, everything is wanting, gallant bird!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master seized thee without further word.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like thine own lure, he whirled thee round; ah me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pomp and flutter of brave falconry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells, the jesses, the bright scarlet hood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flight and the pursuit o'er field and wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these forevermore are ended now;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer victor, but the victim thou!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the board a snow-white cloth he spread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid on its wooden dish the loaf of bread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought purple grapes with autumn sunshine hot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragrant peach, the juicy bergamot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the midst a flask of wine he placed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with autumnal flowers the banquet graced.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo, would not these suffice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without thy falcon stuffed with cloves and spice?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all was ready, and the courtly dame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her companion to the cottage came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Ser Federigo's brain there fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild enchantment of a magic spell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room they entered, mean and low and small,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was changed into a sumptuous banquet-hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fanfares by aerial trumpets blown;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rustic chair she sat on was a throne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ate celestial food, and a divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flavor was given to his country wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the poor falcon, fragrant with his spice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A peacock was, or bird of paradise!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the repast was ended, they arose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed again into the garden-close.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the lady, "Far too well I know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering still the days of long ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you betray it not with what surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see me here in this familiar wise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have no children, and you cannot guess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What anguish, what unspeakable distress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mother feels, whose child is lying ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor how her heart anticipates his will.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet for this, you see me lay aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All womanly reserve and check of pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ask the thing most precious in your sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your falcon, your sole comfort and delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which if you find it in your heart to give,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My poor, unhappy boy perchance may live."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo listens, and replies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tears of love and pity in his eyes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas, dear lady! there can be no task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sweet to me, as giving when you ask.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One little hour ago, if I had known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wish of yours, it would have been my own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thinking in what manner I could best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do honor to the presence of my guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deemed that nothing worthier could be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than what most dear and precious was to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so my gallant falcon breathed his last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To furnish forth this morning our repast."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mute contrition, mingled with dismay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle lady tuned her eyes away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grieving that he such sacrifice should make,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kill his falcon for a woman's sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet feeling in her heart a woman's pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nothing she could ask for was denied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then took her leave, and passed out at the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With footstep slow and soul disconsolate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days went by, and lo! a passing-bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolled from the little chapel in the dell;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten strokes Ser Federigo heard, and said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing a prayer, "Alas! her child is dead!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months went by; and lo! a merrier chime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang from the chapel bells at Christmas time;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cottage was deserted, and no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ser Federigo sat beside its door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, with servitors to do his will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the grand villa, half-way up the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat at the Christmas feast, and at his side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monna Giovanna, his beloved bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never so beautiful, so kind, so fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enthroned once more in the old rustic chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-perched upon the back of which there stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of a falcon carved in wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And underneath the inscription, with date,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All things come round to him who will but wait."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as the story reached its end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, over eager to commend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned it with injudicious praise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the voice of blame found vent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fanned the embers of dissent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a somewhat lively blaze.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian shook his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These old Italian tales," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the much-praised Decameron down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the rabble of the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are either trifling, dull, or lewd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gossip of a neighborhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some remote provincial town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scandalous chronicle at best!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to me a stagnant fen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown rank with rushes and with reeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a white lily, now and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blooms in the midst of noxious weeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deadly nightshade on its banks."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this the Student straight replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the white lily, many thanks!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One should not say, with too much pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fountain, I will not drink of thee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor were it grateful to forget,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That from these reservoirs and tanks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even imperial Shakespeare drew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Moor of Venice, and the Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Romeo and Juliet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a famous comedy."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a long pause; till some one said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Angel is flying overhead!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At these words spake the Spanish Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmured with an inward breath:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God grant, if what you say be true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be the Angel of Death!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then another pause; and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stroking his beard, he said again:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This brings back to my memory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A story in the Talmud told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That book of gems, that book of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wonders many and manifold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale that often comes to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fills my heart, and haunts my brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never wearies nor grows old."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SPANISH JEW'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Ben Levi, on the Sabbath, read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A volume of the Law, in which it said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No man shall look upon my face and live."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he read, he prayed that God would give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His faithful servant grace with mortal eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look upon His face and yet not die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fell a sudden shadow on the page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lifting up his eyes, grown dim with age
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the Angel of Death before him stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding a naked sword in his right hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Ben Levi was a righteous man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet through his veins a chill of terror ran.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With trembling voice he said, "What wilt thou here?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel answered, "Lo! the time draws near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou must die; yet first, by God's decree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er thou askest shall be granted thee."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replied the Rabbi, "Let these living eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First look upon my place in Paradise."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the Angel, "Come with me and look."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Ben Levi closed the sacred book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rising, and uplifting his gray head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me thy sword," he to the Angel said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lest thou shouldst fall upon me by the way."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel smiled and hastened to obey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then led him forth to the Celestial Town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set him on the wall, whence, gazing down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi Ben Levi, with his living eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might look upon his place in Paradise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then straight into the city of the Lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rabbi leaped with the Death-Angel's sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the streets there swept a sudden breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of something there unknown, which men call death.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Angel stayed without and cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come back!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which the Rabbi's voice replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! in the name of God, whom I adore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear that hence I will depart no more!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all the Angels cried, "O Holy One,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See what the son of Levi here hath done!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom of Heaven he takes by violence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Thy name refuses to go hence!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord replied, "My Angels, be not wroth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did e'er the son of Levi break his oath?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him remain; for he with mortal eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall look upon my face and yet not die."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the outer wall the Angel of Death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the great voice, and said, with panting breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give back the sword, and let me go my way."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat the Rabbi paused, and answered, "Nay!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anguish enough already hath it caused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the sons of men."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while he paused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the awful mandate of the Lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resounding through the air, "Give back the sword!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rabbi bowed his head in silent prayer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said he to the dreadful Angel, "Swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No human eye shall look on it again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when thou takest away the souls of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thyself unseen, and with an unseen sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt perform the bidding of the Lord."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel took the sword again, and swore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And walks on earth unseen forevermore.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ended: and a kind of spell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the silent listeners fell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His solemn manner and his words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had touched the deep, mysterious chords,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That vibrate in each human breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike, but not alike confessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual world seemed near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close above them, full of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its awful adumbration passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A luminous shadow, vague and vast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They almost feared to look, lest there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embodied from the impalpable air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might behold the Angel stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the sword in his right hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, but in a voice subdued,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to disturb their dreamy mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the Sicilian: "While you spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling your legend marvellous,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly in my memory woke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of one, now gone from us,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old Abate, meek and mild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and teacher, when a child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sometimes in those days of old
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of an Angel told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ran, as I remember, thus?'



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SICILIAN'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING ROBERT OF SICILY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparelled in magnificent attire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With retinue of many a knight and squire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On St. John's eve, at vespers, proudly sat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard the priests chant the Magnificat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he listened, o'er and o'er again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeated, like a burden or refrain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught the words, "Deposuit potentes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;De sede, et exaltavit humiles";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slowly lifting up his kingly head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He to a learned clerk beside him said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What mean these words?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk made answer meet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has put down the mighty from their seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has exalted them of low degree."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is well that such seditious words are sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only by priests and in the Latin tongue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unto priests and people be it known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no power can push me from my throne!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaning back, he yawned and fell asleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lulled by the chant monotonous and deep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he awoke, it was already night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church was empty, and there was no light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted a little space before some saint.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started from his seat and gazed around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But saw no living thing and heard no sound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He groped towards the door, but it was locked;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And uttered awful threatenings and complaints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And imprecations upon men and saints.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sounds re-echoed from the roof and walls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if dead priests were laughing in their stalls.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length the sexton, hearing from without
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumult of the knocking and the shout,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinking thieves were in the house of prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came with his lantern, asking, "Who is there?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half choked with rage, King Robert fiercely said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open: 'tis I, the King!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou afraid?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frightened sexton, muttering, with a curse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is some drunken vagabond, or worse!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned the great key and flung the portal wide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man rushed by him at a single stride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haggard, half naked, without hat or cloak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But leaped into the blackness of the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vanished like a spectre from his sight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despoiled of his magnificent attire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bareheaded, breathless, and besprent with mire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sense of wrong and outrage desperate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strode on and thundered at the palace gate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed through the courtyard, thrusting in his rage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To right and left each seneschal and page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurried up the broad and sounding stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white face ghastly in the torches' glare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hall to hall he passed with breathless speed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices and cries he heard, but did not heed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last he reached the banquet-room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blazing with light and breathing with perfume.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There on the dais sat another king,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing his robes, his crown, his signet-ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Robert's self in features, form, and height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all transfigured with angelic light!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an Angel; and his presence there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a divine effulgence filled the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exaltation, piercing the disguise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though none the hidden Angel recognize.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment speechless, motionless, amazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throneless monarch on the Angel gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who met his look of anger and surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the divine compassion of his eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said, "Who art thou? and why com'st thou here?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which King Robert answered, with a sneer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the King, and come to claim my own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an impostor, who usurps my throne!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suddenly, at these audacious words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel answered, with unruffled brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, not the King, but the King's Jester, thou
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth shall wear the bells and scalloped cape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for thy counsellor shalt lead an ape;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt obey my servants when they call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wait upon my henchmen in the hall!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deaf to King Robert's threats and cries and prayers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They thrust him from the hall and down the stairs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of tittering pages ran before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they opened wide the folding door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the vaulted chamber roar and ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mock plaudits of "Long live the King!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next morning, waking with the day's first beam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said within himself, "It was a dream!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the straw rustled as he turned his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were the cap and bells beside his bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around him rose the bare, discolored walls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the corner, a revolting shape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no dream; the world he loved so much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had turned to dust and ashes at his touch!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days came and went; and now returned again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Sicily the old Saturnian reign;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Angel's governance benign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy island danced with corn and wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deep within the mountain's burning breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enceladus, the giant, was at rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sullen and silent and disconsolate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed in the motley garb that Jesters wear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With look bewildered and a vacant stare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only friend the ape, his only food
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What others left,--he still was unsubdued.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the Angel met him on his way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half in earnest, half in jest, would say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The velvet scabbard held a sword of steel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art thou the King?" the passion of his woe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst from him in resistless overflow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lifting high his forehead, he would fling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haughty answer back, "I am, I am the King!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost three years were ended; when there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambassadors of great repute and name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto King Robert, saying that Pope Urbane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By letter summoned them forthwith to come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Holy Thursday to his city of Rome.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel with great joy received his guests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave them presents of embroidered vests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And velvet mantles with rich ermine lined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rings and jewels of the rarest kind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he departed with them o'er the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the lovely land of Italy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose loveliness was more resplendent made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the mere passing of that cavalcade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of jewelled bridle and of golden spur.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! among the menials, in mock state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cloak of fox-tails flapping in the wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solemn ape demurely perched behind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Robert rode, making huge merriment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the country towns through which they went.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope received them with great pomp and blare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bannered trumpets, on Saint Peter's square,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving his benediction and embrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fervent, and full of apostolic grace.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While with congratulations and with prayers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entertained the Angel unawares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert, the Jester, bursting through the crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into their presence rushed, and cried aloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the King!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, and behold in me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert, your brother, King of Sicily!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man, who wears my semblance to your eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is an impostor in a king's disguise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you not know me? does no voice within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer my cry, and say we are akin?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope in silence, but with troubled mien,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed at the Angel's countenance serene;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor, laughing, said, "It is strange sport
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep a mad man for thy Fool at court!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the poor, baffled Jester in disgrace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hustled back among the populace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In solemn state the Holy Week went by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Easter Sunday gleamed upon the sky;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of the Angel, with its light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the sun rose, made the city bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with new fervor filled the hearts of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who felt that Christ indeed had risen again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Jester, on his bed of straw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt within a power unfelt before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, kneeling humbly on his chamber floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the rushing garments of the Lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the visit ending, and once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valmond returning to the Danube's shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward the Angel journeyed, and again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land was made resplendent with his train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashing along the towns of Italy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto Salerno, and from thence by sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when once more within Palermo's wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, seated on the throne in his great hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the Angelus from convent towers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the better world conversed with ours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beckoned to King Robert to draw nigher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a gesture bade the rest retire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they were alone, the Angel said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art thou the King?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, bowing down his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Robert crossed both hands upon his breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meekly answered him: "Thou knowest best!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sins as scarlet are; let me go hence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in some cloister's school of penitence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across those stones, that pave the way to heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk barefoot, till my guilty soul be shriven!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel smiled, and from his radiant face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A holy light illumined all the place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the open window, loud and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard the monks chant in the chapel near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the stir and tumult of the street:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has put down the mighty from their seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has exalted them of low degree!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the chant a second melody
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose like the throbbing of a single string:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am an Angel, and thou art the King!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Robert, who was standing near the throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all apparelled as in days of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ermined mantle and with cloth of gold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when his courtiers came, they found him there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneeling upon the floor, absorbed in, silent prayer.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the blue-eyed Norseman told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Saga of the days of old.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is," said he, "a wondrous book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Legends in the old Norse tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the dead kings of Norroway,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legends that once were told or sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many a smoky fireside nook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Iceland, in the ancient day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By wandering Saga-man or Scald;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heimskringla is the volume called;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he who looks may find therein
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story that I now begin."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in each pause the story made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his violin he played,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an appropriate interlude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fragments of old Norwegian tunes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bound in one the separate runes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held the mind in perfect mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entwining and encircling all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange and antiquated rhymes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with melodies of olden times;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As over some half-ruined wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disjointed and about to fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh woodbines climb and interlace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep the loosened stones in place.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MUSICIAN'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SAGA OF KING OLAF

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE CHALLENGE OF THOR

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the God Thor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the War God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the Thunderer!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in my Northland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fastness and fortress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reign I forever!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here amid icebergs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule I the nations;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my hammer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miolner the mighty;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giants and sorcerers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot withstand it!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the gauntlets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith I wield it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurl it afar off;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my girdle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I brace it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength is redoubled!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light thou beholdest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stream through the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In flashes of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but my red beard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown by the night-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affrighting the nations!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jove is my brother;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine eyes are the lightning;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheels of my chariot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll in the thunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blows of my hammer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring in the earthquake!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Force rules the world still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has ruled it, shall rule it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekness is weakness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength is triumphant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the whole earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still is it Thor's-Day!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art a God too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Galilean!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus single-handed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the combat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gauntlet or Gospel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I defy thee!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING OLAF'S RETURN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And King Olaf heard the cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the red light in the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid his hand upon his sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he leaned upon the railing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his ships went sailing, sailing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northward into Drontheim fiord.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he stood as one who dreamed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the red light glanced and gleamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the armor that he wore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he shouted, as the rifled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamers o'er him shook and shifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I accept thy challenge, Thor!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avenge his father slain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reconquer realm and reign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the youthful Olaf home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the midnight sailing, sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the wild wind's wailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dashing of the foam.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his thoughts the sacred name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his mother Astrid came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tale she oft had told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her flight by secret passes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the mountains and morasses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the home of Hakon old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then strange memories crowded back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Queen Gunhild's wrath and wrack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a hurried flight by sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of grim Vikings, and the rapture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sea-fight, and the capture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the life of slavery.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How a stranger watched his face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Esthonian market-place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanned his features one by one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "We should know each other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Sigurd, Astrid's brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art Olaf, Astrid's son!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as Queen Allogia's page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old in honors, young in age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief of all her men-at-arms;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till vague whispers, and mysterious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reached King Valdemar, the imperious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling him with strange alarms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his cruisings o'er the seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward to the Hebrides,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to Scilly's rocky shore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hermit's cavern dismal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ's great name and rites baptismal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the ocean's rush and roar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these thoughts of love and strife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glimmered through his lurid life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the stars' intenser light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the red flames o'er him trailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As his ships went sailing, sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northward in the summer night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trained for either camp or court,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skilful in each manly sport,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young and beautiful and tall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art of warfare, craft of chases,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swimming, skating, snow-shoe races
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent alike in all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at sea, with all his rowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He along the bending oars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of his ship could run.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the Smalsor Horn ascended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his shining shield suspended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its summit, like a sun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ship-rails he could stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wield his sword with either hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at once two javelins throw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all feasts where ale was strongest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the merry monarch longest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First to come and last to go.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norway never yet had seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One so beautiful of mien,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One so royal in attire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in arms completely furnished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harness gold-inlaid and burnished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mantle like a flame of fire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus came Olaf to his own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When upon the night-wind blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed that cry along the shore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he answered, while the rifted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamers o'er him shook and shifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I accept thy challenge, Thor!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THORA OF RIMOL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thora of Rimol! hide me! hide me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danger and shame and death betide me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Olaf the King is hunting me down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through field and forest, through thorp and town!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus cried Jarl Hakon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Thora, the fairest of women.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hakon Jarl! for the love I bear thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither shall shame nor death come near thee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the hiding-place wherein thou must lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the cave underneath the swine in the sty."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to Jarl Hakon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Thora, the fairest of women.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Hakon Jarl and his base thrall Karker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouched in the cave, than a dungeon darker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Olaf came riding, with men in mail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the forest roads into Orkadale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demanding Jarl Hakon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Thorn, the fairest of women.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich and honored shall be whoever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Hakon Jarl shall dissever!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hakon heard him, and Karker the slave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the breathing-holes of the darksome cave.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone in her chamber
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wept Thora, the fairest of women.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Karker, the crafty, "I will not slay thee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the king's gold I will never betray thee!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then why dost thou turn so pale, O churl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again black as the earth?" said the Earl.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More pale and more faithful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Thora, the fairest of women.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a dream in the night the thrall started, saying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Round my neck a gold ring King Olaf was laying!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hakon answered, "Beware of the king!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will lay round thy neck a blood-red ring."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the ring on her finger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed Thorn, the fairest of women.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At daybreak slept Hakon, with sorrows encumbered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But screamed and drew up his feet as he slumbered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrall in the darkness plunged with his knife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Earl awakened no more in this life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wakeful and weeping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat Thorn, the fairest of women.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Nidarholm the priests are all singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ghastly heads on the gibbet are swinging;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is Jarl Hakon's and one is his thrall's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people are shouting from windows and walls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While alone in her chamber
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swoons Thorn, the fairest of women.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Sigrid the Haughty sat proud and aloft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her chamber, that looked over meadow and croft.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart's dearest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost thou sorrow so?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor with tassels of fir was besprent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the room with their fragrant scent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard the birds sing, she saw the sun shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air of summer was sweeter than wine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sword without scabbard the bright river lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between her own kingdom and Norroway.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Olaf the King had sued for her hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword would be sheathed, the river be spanned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her maidens were seated around her knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working bright figures in tapestry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was singing the ancient rune
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Brynhilda's love and the wrath of Gudrun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through it, and round it, and over it all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded incessant the waterfall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen in her hand held a ring of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the door of Lade's Temple old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf had sent her this wedding gift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her thoughts as arrows were keen and swift.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had given the ring to her goldsmiths twain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who smiled, as they handed it back again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sigrid the Queen, in her haughty way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, "Why do you smile, my goldsmiths, say?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they answered: "O Queen! if the truth must be told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring is of copper, and not of gold!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning flashed o'er her forehead and cheek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only murmured, she did not speak:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If in his gifts he can faithless be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no gold in his love to me."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A footstep was heard on the outer stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in strode King Olaf with royal air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kissed the Queen's hand, and he whispered of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swore to be true as the stars are above.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she smiled with contempt as she answered: "O King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you swear it, as Odin once swore, on the ring?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King: "O speak not of Odin to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife of King Olaf a Christian must be."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking straight at the King, with her level brows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, "I keep true to my faith and my vows."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the face of King Olaf was darkened with gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose in his anger and strode through the room.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, then, should I care to have thee?" he said,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A faded old woman, a heathenish jade!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His zeal was stronger than fear or love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he struck the Queen in the face with his glove.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then forth from the chamber in anger he fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wooden stairway shook with his tread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Sigrid the Haughty said under her breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This insult, King Olaf, shall be thy death!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart's dearest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost thou sorrow so?



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SKERRY OF SHRIEKS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now from all King Olaf's farms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His men-at-arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathered on the Eve of Easter;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his house at Angvalds-ness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast they press,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking with the royal feaster.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loudly through the wide-flung door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the roar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sea upon the Skerry;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its thunder loud and near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reached the ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingling with their voices merry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hark!" said Olaf to his Scald,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halfred the Bald,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to that song, and learn it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half my kingdom would I give,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I live,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If by such songs you would earn it!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For of all the runes and rhymes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all times,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best I like the ocean's dirges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old harper heaves and rocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hoary locks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowing and flashing in the surges!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halfred answered: "I am called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unappalled!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing hinders me or daunts me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearken to me, then, O King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great Ocean Song that haunts me."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will hear your song sublime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other time,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says the drowsy monarch, yawning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And retires; each laughing guest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applauds the jest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they sleep till day is dawning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facing up and down the yard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf's guard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the sea-mist slowly creeping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the sands, and up the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the house where they were sleeping.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not the fog he saw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor misty flaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That above the landscape brooded;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Eyvind Kallda's crew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of warlocks blue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their caps of darkness hooded!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round and round the house they go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaving slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic circles to encumber
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And imprison in their ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olaf the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he helpless lies in slumber.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then athwart the vapors dun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Easter sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamed with one broad track of splendor!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their real forms appeared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warlocks weird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awful as the Witch of Endor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinded by the light that glared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They groped and stared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about with steps unsteady;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his window Olaf gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, amazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are these strange people?" said he.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eyvind Kallda and his men!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the yard a sturdy farmer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the men-at-arms apace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busily buckling on their armor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gates they sallied forth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South and north,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scoured the island coast around them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizing all the warlock band,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foot and hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Skerry's rocks they bound them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at eve the king again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called his train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with all the candles burning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent sat and heard once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sullen roar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the ocean tides returning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrieks and cries of wild despair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing fainter as they listened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the bursting surge alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded on;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the sorcerers were christened!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sing, O Scald, your song sublime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ocean-rhyme,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried King Olaf: "it will cheer me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the Scald, with pallid cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Skerry of Shrieks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sings too loud for you to hear me!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE WRAITH OF ODIN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guests were loud, the ale was strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf feasted late and long;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoary Scalds together sang;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erhead the smoky rafters rang.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door swung wide, with creak and din;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blast of cold night-air came in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the threshold shivering stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A one-eyed guest, with cloak and hood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King exclaimed, "O graybeard pale!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come warm thee with this cup of ale."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foaming draught the old man quaffed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noisy guests looked on and laughed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake the King: "Be not afraid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit here by me."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest obeyed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, seated at the table, told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tales of the sea, and Sagas old.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever, when the tale was o'er,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King demanded yet one more;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Sigurd the Bishop smiling said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is late, O King, and time for bed."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King retired; the stranger guest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed and entered with the rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights were out, the pages gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still the garrulous guest spake on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who from a volume reads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spake of heroes and their deeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lands and cities he had seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stormy gulfs that tossed between.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from his lips in music rolled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Havamal of Odin old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sounds mysterious as the roar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of billows on a distant shore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we not learn from runes and rhymes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by the gods in elder times,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not still the great Scalds teach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That silence better is than speech?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling at this, the King replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy lore is by thy tongue belied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For never was I so enthralled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either by Saga-man or Scald,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop said, "Late hours we keep!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night wanes, O King! 't is time for sleep!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then slept the King, and when he woke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest was gone, the morning broke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found the doors securely barred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found the watch-dog in the yard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no footprint in the grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none had seen the stranger pass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf crossed himself and said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that Odin the Great is dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure is the triumph of our Faith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed stranger was his wraith."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead rides Sir Morten of Fogelsang.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRON-BEARD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olaf the King, one summer morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew a blast on his bugle-horn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending his signal through the land of Drontheim.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the Hus-Ting held at Mere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathered the farmers far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their war weapons ready to confront him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ploughing under the morning star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Iron-Beard in Yriar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the summons, chuckling with a low laugh.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wiped the sweat-drops from his brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unharnessed his horses from the plough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clattering came on horseback to King Olaf.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the churliest of the churls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little he cared for king or earls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitter as home-brewed ale were his foaming passions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hodden-gray was the garb he wore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the Hammer of Thor he swore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hated the narrow town, and all its fashions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he loved the freedom of his farm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ale at night, by the fireside warm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gudrun his daughter, with her flaxen tresses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved his horses and his herds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of the earth, and the song of birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His well-filled barns, his brook with its water-cresses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge and cumbersome was his frame;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beard, from which he took his name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frosty and fierce, like that of Hymer the Giant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at the Hus-Ting he appeared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer of Yriar, Iron-Beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On horseback, in an attitude defiant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to King Olaf he cried aloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the middle of the crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tossed about him like a stormy ocean:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Such sacrifices shalt thou bring;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Odin and to Thor, O King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As other kings have done in their devotion!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf answered: "I command
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land to be a Christian land;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my Bishop who the folk baptizes!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you ask me to restore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sacrifices, stained with gore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then will I offer human sacrifices!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not slaves and peasants shall they be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But men of note and high degree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such men as Orm of Lyra and Kar of Gryting!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then to their Temple strode he in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And loud behind him heard the din
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his men-at-arms and the peasants fiercely fighting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the Temple, carved in wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of great Odin stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other gods, with Thor supreme among them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf smote them with the blade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his huge war-axe, gold inlaid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And downward shattered to the pavement flung them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same moment rose without,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the contending crowd, a shout,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mingled sound of triumph and of wailing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there upon the trampled plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer iron-Beard lay slain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midway between the assailed and the assailing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf from the doorway spoke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Choose ye between two things, my folk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be baptized or given up to slaughter!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing their leader stark and dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people with a murmur said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O King, baptize us with thy holy water";

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all the Drontheim land became
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Christian land in name and fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old gods no more believing and trusting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a blood-atonement, soon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf wed the fair Gudrun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus in peace ended the Drontheim Hus-Ting!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GUDRUN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On King Olaf's bridal night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines the moon with tender light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And across the chamber streams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its tide of dreams.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fatal midnight hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all evil things have power,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glimmer of the moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands Gudrun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close against her heaving breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something in her hand is pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an icicle, its sheen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is cold and keen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cairn are fixed her eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where her murdered father lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a voice remote and drear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to hear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a bridal night is this!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold will be the dagger's kiss;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laden with the chill of death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is its breath.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the drifting snow she sweeps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the couch where Olaf sleeps;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly he wakes and stirs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes meet hers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that," King Olaf said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gleams so bright above thy head?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore standest thou so white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pale moonlight?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the bodkin that I wear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at night I bind my hair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It woke me falling on the floor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is nothing more."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forests have ears, and fields have eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often treachery lurking lies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the fairest hair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gudrun beware!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the earliest peep of morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew King Olaf's bugle-horn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forever sundered ride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridegroom and bride!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THANGBRAND THE PRIEST

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short of stature, large of limb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burly face and russet beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the women stared at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in Iceland he appeared.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look!" they said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With nodding head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There goes Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the prayers he knew by rote,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could preach like Chrysostome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Fathers he could quote,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had even been at Rome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A learned clerk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of mark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quarrelsome and loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And impatient of control,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boisterous in the market crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boisterous at the wassail-bowl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would drink and swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swaggering Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his house this malcontent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the King no longer bear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to Iceland he was sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To convert the heathen there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One summer day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed this Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in Iceland, o'er their books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pored the people day and night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not like their looks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the songs they used to write.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All this rhyme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is waste of time!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grumbled Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the alehouse, where he sat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Scalds and Saga-men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it to be wondered at,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they quarrelled now and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When o'er his beer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Began to leer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drunken Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the folk in Altafiord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasted of their island grand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying in a single word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iceland is the finest land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth shine upon!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud laughed Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he answered: "What's the use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this bragging up and down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When three women and one goose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a market in your town!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Scald
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satires scrawled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On poor Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something worse they did than that;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what vexed him most of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a figure in shovel hat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn in charcoal on the wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With words that go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprawling below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly knowing what he did,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he smote them might and main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorvald Veile and Veterlid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay there in the alehouse slain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To-day we are gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow mould!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muttered Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much in fear of axe and rope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Norway sailed he then.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, King Olaf! little hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there of these Iceland men!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekly said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bending head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pious Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RAUD THE STRONG

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the old gods are dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wild warlocks fled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the White Christ lives and reigns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And throughout my wide domains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Gospel shall be spread!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Evangelists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus swore King Olaf.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still in dreams of the night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beheld he the crimson light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard the voice that defied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him who was crucified,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And challenged him to the fight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Sigurd the Bishop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf confessed it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sigurd the Bishop said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old gods are not dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the great Thor still reigns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among the Jarls and Thanes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witchcraft still is spread."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to King Olaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Sigurd the Bishop.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far north in the Salten Fiord,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By rapine, fire, and sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives the Viking, Raud the Strong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Godoe Isles belong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him and his heathen horde."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus went on speaking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigurd the Bishop.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A warlock, a wizard is he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lord of the wind and the sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whichever way he sails,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has ever favoring gales,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his craft in sorcery."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the sign of the cross
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made devoutly King Olaf.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With rites that we both abhor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He worships Odin and Thor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it cannot yet be said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all the old gods are dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the warlocks are no more,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flushing with anger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Sigurd the Bishop.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then King Olaf cried aloud:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will talk with this mighty Raud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And along the Salten Fiord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preach the Gospel with my sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or be brought back in my shroud!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So northward from Drontheim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed King Olaf!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BISHOP SIGURD AT SALTEN FIORD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud the angry wind was wailing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As King Olaf's ships came sailing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northward out of Drontheim haven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the mouth of Salten Fiord.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the flying sea-spray drenches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fore and aft the rowers' benches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a single heart is craven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the champions there on board.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All without the Fiord was quiet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But within it storm and riot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as on his Viking cruises
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raud the Strong was wont to ride.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sea through all its tide-ways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept the reeling vessels sideways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leaves are swept through sluices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flood-gates open wide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'T is the warlock! 't is the demon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raud!" cried Sigurd to the seamen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the Lord is not affrighted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the witchcraft of his foes."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ship's bow he ascended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his choristers attended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round him were the tapers lighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sacred incense rose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bow stood Bishop Sigurd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his robes, as one transfigured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Crucifix he planted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High amid the rain and mist.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with holy water sprinkled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the ship; the mass-bells tinkled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud the monks around him chanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud he read the Evangelist.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As into the Fiord they darted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On each side the water parted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down a path like silver molten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steadily rowed King Olaf's ships;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steadily burned all night the tapers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the White Christ through the vapors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed across the Fiord of Salten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As through John's Apocalypse,--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at last they reached Raud's dwelling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the little isle of Gelling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a guard was at the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a glimmer of light was seen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at anchor, carved and gilded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the dragon-ship he builded;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the grandest ship in Norway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its crest and scales of green.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the stairway, softly creeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the loft where Raud was sleeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their fists they burst asunder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolt and bar that held the door.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drunken with sleep and ale they found him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragged him from his bed and bound him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he stared with stupid wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the look and garb they wore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then King Olaf said: "O Sea-King!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little time have we for speaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose between the good and evil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be baptized, or thou shalt die!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in scorn the heathen scoffer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered: "I disdain thine offer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither fear I God nor Devil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee and thy Gospel I defy!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then between his jaws distended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his frantic struggles ended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through King Olaf's horn an adder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched by fire, they forced to glide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp his tooth was as an arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he gnawed through bone and marrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But without a groan or shudder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raud the Strong blaspheming died.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then baptized they all that region,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swarthy Lap and fair Norwegian,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far as swims the salmon, leaping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the streams of Salten Fiord.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their temples Thor and Odin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay in dust and ashes trodden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As King Olaf, onward sweeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preached the Gospel with his sword.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took the carved and gilded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragon-ship that Raud had builded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tiller single-handed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grasping, steered into the main.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southward sailed the sea-gulls o'er him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southward sailed the ship that bore him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at Drontheim haven landed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olaf and his crew again.




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING OLAF'S CHRISTMAS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Drontheim, Olaf the King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the bells of Yule-tide ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sat in his banquet-hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking the nut-brown ale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his bearded Berserks hale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days his Yule-tide feasts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held with Bishops and Priests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his horn filled up to the brim;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ale was never too strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the Saga-man's tale too long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er his drinking-horn, the sign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made of the cross divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he drank, and muttered his prayers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Berserks evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the sign of the Hammer of Thor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over theirs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gleams of the fire-light dance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon helmet and hauberk and lance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laugh in the eyes of the King;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he cries to Halfred the Scald,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray-bearded, wrinkled, and bald,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sing!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sing me a song divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sword in every line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this shall be thy reward."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he loosened the belt at his waist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in front of the singer placed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sword.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quern-biter of Hakon the Good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith at a stroke he hewed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millstone through and through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Foot-breadth of Thoralf the Strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were neither so broad nor so long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor so true."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Scald took his harp and sang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loud though the music rang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of that shining word;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the harp-strings a clangor made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they were struck with the blade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a sword.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Berserks round about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke forth into a shout
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made the rafters ring:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They smote with their fists on the board,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shouted, "Long live the Sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the King said, "O my son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss the bright word in one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy measures and thy rhymes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Halfred the Scald replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In another 't was multiplied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then King Olaf raised the hilt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of iron, cross-shaped and gilt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "Do not refuse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count well the gain and the loss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor's hammer or Christ's cross:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Halfred the Scald said, "This
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of the Lord I kiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who on it was crucified!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a shout went round the board,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of Christ the Lord,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who died!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then over the waste of snows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noonday sun uprose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the driving mists revealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the lifting of the Host,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By incense-clouds almost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concealed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shining wall a vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shadowy cross was cast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the hilt of the lifted sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in foaming cups of ale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Berserks drank "Was-hael!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Lord!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BUILDING OF THE LONG SERPENT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorberg Skafting, master-builder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his ship-yard by the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling, said, "It would bewilder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any man but Thorberg Skafting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any man but me!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near him lay the Dragon stranded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built of old by Raud the Strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And King Olaf had commanded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should build another Dragon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice as large and long.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore whistled Thorberg Skafting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sat with half-closed eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his head turned sideways, drafting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That new vessel for King Olaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice the Dragon's size.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round him busily hewed and hammered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mallet huge and heavy axe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workmen laughed and sang and clamored;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirred the wheels, that into rigging
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spun the shining flax!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this tumult heard the master,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was music to his ear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy whispered all the faster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men shall hear of Thorberg Skafting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a hundred year!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workmen sweating at the forges
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashioned iron bolt and bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a warlock's midnight orgies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoked and bubbled the black caldron
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the boiling tar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the warlocks mingle in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorberg Skafting, any curse?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you not be gone a minute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some mischief must be doing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning bad to worse?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was an ill wind that came wafting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his homestead words of woe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his farm went Thorberg Skafting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft repeating to his workmen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build ye thus and so.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After long delays returning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the master back by night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his ship-yard longing, yearning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurried he, and did not leave it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the morning's light.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come and see my ship, my darling"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morrow said the King;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finished now from keel to carling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never yet was seen in Norway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a wondrous thing!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ship-yard, idly talking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the ship the workmen stared:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some one, all their labor balking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down her sides had cut deep gashes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a plank was spared!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death be to the evil-doer!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an oath King Olaf spoke;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But rewards to his pursuer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wrath his face grew redder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than his scarlet cloak.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight the master-builder, smiling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered thus the angry King:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cease blaspheming and reviling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olaf, it was Thorberg Skafting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has done this thing!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he chipped and smoothed the planking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the King, delighted, swore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With much lauding and much thanking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Handsomer is now my Dragon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than she was before!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy ells and four extended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grass the vessel's keel;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High above it, gilt and splendid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the figure-head ferocious
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its crest of steel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they launched her from the tressels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ship-yard by the sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the grandest of all vessels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never ship was built in Norway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half so fine as she!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Serpent was she christened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid the roar of cheer on cheer!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who to the Saga listened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the name of Thorberg Skafting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a hundred year!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE CREW OF THE LONG SERPENT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe at anchor in Drontheim bay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf's fleet assembled lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, striped with white and blue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward fluttered sail and banner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As alights the screaming lanner;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lustily cheered, in their wild manner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Serpent's crew

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her forecastle man was Ulf the Red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wolf's was his shaggy head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His teeth as large and white;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beard, of gray and russet blended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round as a swallow's nest descended;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As standard-bearer he defended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olaf's flag in the fight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near him Kolbiorn had his place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the King in garb and face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So gallant and so hale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every cabin-boy and varlet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondered at his cloak of scarlet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a river, frozen and star-lit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed his coat of mail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the bulkhead, tall and dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood Thrand Rame of Thelemark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure gaunt and grand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his hairy arm imprinted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was an anchor, azure-tinted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Thor's hammer, huge and dinted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was his brawny hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einar Tamberskelver, bare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the winds his golden hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the mainmast stood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graceful was his form, and slender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his eyes were deep and tender
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a woman's, in the splendor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her maidenhood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fore-hold Biorn and Bork
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched the sailors at their work:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavens! how they swore!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty men they each commanded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron-sinewed, horny-handed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoulders broad, and chests expanded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tugging at the oar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, and many more like these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With King Olaf sailed the seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the waters vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled them with a vague devotion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the freedom and the motion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the roll and roar of ocean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sounding blast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they landed from the fleet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they roared through Drontheim's street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boisterous as the gale!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they laughed and stamped and pounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the tavern roof resounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the host looked on astounded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they drank the ale!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never saw the wild North Sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a gallant company
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail its billows blue!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never, while they cruised and quarrelled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old King Gorm, or Blue-Tooth Harald,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owned a ship so well apparelled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasted such a crew!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A LITTLE BIRD IN THE AIR

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bird in the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is singing of Thyri the fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sister of Svend the Dane;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the song of the garrulous bird
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the streets of the town is heard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And repeated again and again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoist up your sails of silk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flee away from each other.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To King Burislaf, it is said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the beautiful Thyri wed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a sorrowful bride went she;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after a week and a day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has fled away and away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his town by the stormy sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoist up your sails of silk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flee away from each other.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say, that through heat and through cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through weald, they say, and through wold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By day and by night, they say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has fled; and the gossips report
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has come to King Olaf's court,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the town is all in dismay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoist up your sails of silk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flee away from each other.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is whispered King Olaf has seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has talked with the beautiful Queen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they wonder how it will end;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For surely, if here she remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is war with King Svend the Dane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And King Burislaf the Vend!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoist up your sails of silk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flee away from each other.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, greatest wonder of all!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is published in hamlet and hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It roars like a flame that is fanned!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King--yes, Olaf the King--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has wedded her with his ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Thyri is Queen in the land!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoist up your sails of silk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flee away from each other.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUEEN THYRI AND THE ANGELICA STALKS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northward over Drontheim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew the clamorous sea-gulls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the lark and linnet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the meadows green;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping in her chamber,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely and unhappy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the Drottning Thyri,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat King Olaf's Queen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In at all the windows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamed the pleasant sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the roof above her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly cooed the dove;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sound she heard not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the sunshine heeded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the thoughts of Thyri
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were not thoughts of love,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then King Olaf entered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful as morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the sun at Easter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone his happy face;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his hand he carried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angelicas uprooted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With delicious fragrance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling all the place.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a rainy midnight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the Drottning Thyri,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the smile of Olaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not cheer her gloom;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the stalks he gave her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gracious gesture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with words as pleasant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As their own perfume.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her hands he placed them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her jewelled fingers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the green leaves glistened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the dews of morn;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she cast them from her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haughty and indignant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the floor she threw them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a look of scorn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Richer presents," said she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gave King Harald Gormson
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Queen, my mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than such worthless weeds;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When he ravaged Norway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laying waste the kingdom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizing scatt and treasure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her royal needs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But thou darest not venture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Sound to Vendland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My domains to rescue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From King Burislaf;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lest King Svend of Denmark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forked Beard, my brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scatter all thy vessels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the wind the chaff."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then up sprang King Olaf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a reindeer bounding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an oath he answered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the luckless Queen:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never yet did Olaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear King Svend of Denmark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This right hand shall hale him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his forked chin!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he left the chamber,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thundering through the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud his steps resounded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the outer stair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smarting with the insult,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the streets of Drontheim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strode he red and wrathful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his stately air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his ships he gathered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned all his forces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making his war levy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the region round;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the coast of Norway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a flock of sea-gulls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed the fleet of Olaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Danish Sound.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his own hand fearless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steered he the Long Serpent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strained the creaking cordage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent each boom and gaff;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in Venland landing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domains of Thyri
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He redeemed and rescued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From King Burislaf.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said Olaf, laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not ten yoke of oxen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the power to draw us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a woman's hair!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now will I confess it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better things are jewels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than angelica stalks are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a Queen to wear."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING SVEND OF THE FORKED BEAR

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loudly the sailors cheered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Svend of the Forked Beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with his fleet he steered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southward to Vendland;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where with their courses hauled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were together called,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Isle of Svald
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near to the mainland.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Queen Gunhild's death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the old Saga saith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plighted King Svend his faith
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Sigrid the Haughty;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to avenge his bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothing her wounded pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the waters wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf sought he.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on her scornful face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushing with deep disgrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore she the crimson trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Olaf's gauntlet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a malignant star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blazing in heaven afar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red shone the angry scar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under her frontlet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft to King Svend she spake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For thine own honor's sake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shalt thou swift vengeance take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the vile coward!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the King at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gusty and overcast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a tempestuous blast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threatened and lowered.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as the Spring appeared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Svend of the Forked Beard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High his red standard reared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eager for battle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While every warlike Dane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizing his arms again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left all unsown the grain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhoused the cattle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise the Swedish King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned in haste a Thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weapons and men to bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In aid of Denmark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erie the Norseman, too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the war-tidings flew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed with a chosen crew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Lapland and Finmark.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So upon Easter day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed the three kings away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the sheltered bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bright season;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them Earl Sigvald came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eager for spoil and fame;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pity that such a name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stooped to such treason!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe under Svald at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now were their anchors cast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe from the sea and blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plotted the three kings;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, with a base intent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southward Earl Sigvald went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a foul errand bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the Sea-kings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thence to hold on his course,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto King Olaf's force,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying within the hoarse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouths of Stet-haven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him to ensnare and bring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the Danish king,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who his dead corse would fling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth to the raven!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING OLAF AND EARL SIGVALD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gray sea-sands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf stands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northward and seaward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He points with his hands.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eddy and whirl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-tides curl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washing the sandals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Sigvald the Earl.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mariners shout,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ships swing about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yards are all hoisted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sails flutter out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war-horns are played,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anchors are weighed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like moths in the distance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sails flit and fade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is like lead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harbor lies dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a corse on the sea-shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose spirit has fled!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that fatal day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The histories say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy vessels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed out of the bay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon scattered wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the billows they ride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sigvald and Olaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail side by side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried the Earl: "Follow me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I your pilot will be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I know all the channels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where flows the deep sea!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So into the strait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where his foes lie in wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallant King Olaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sails to his fate!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the sea-fog veils
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ships and their sails;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Sigrid the Haughty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy vengeance prevails!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING OLAF'S WAR-HORNS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strike the sails!" King Olaf said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never shall men of mine take flight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never away from battle I fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never away from my foes!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let God dispose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my life in the fight!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sound the horns!" said Olaf the King;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suddenly through the drifting brume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blare of the horns began to ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the terrible trumpet shock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Regnarock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Day of Doom!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louder and louder the war-horns sang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the level floor of the flood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sails came down with a clang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there in the mist overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun hung red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a drop of blood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting down on the Danish fleet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three together the ships were lashed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that neither should turn and retreat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst, but in front of the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burnished crest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Serpent flashed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf stood on the quarter-deck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bow of ash and arrows of oak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gilded shield was without a fleck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His helmet inlaid with gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in many a fold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung his crimson cloak.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the forecastle Ulf the Red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched the lashing of the ships;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Serpent lie so far ahead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall have hard work of it here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he with a sneer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his bearded lips.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf laid an arrow on string,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have I a coward on board?" said he.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shoot it another way, O King!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sullenly answered Ulf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old sea-wolf;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have need of me!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front came Svend, the King of the Danes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping down with his fifty rowers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the right, the Swedish king with his thanes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on board of the Iron Beard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl Eric steered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the left with his oars.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These soft Danes and Swedes," said the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At home with their wives had better stay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than come within reach of my Serpent's sting:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where Eric the Norseman leads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic deeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be done to-day!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as together the vessels crashed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric severed the cables of hide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With which King Olaf's ships were lashed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left them to drive and drift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the currents swift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the outward tide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louder the war-horns growl and snarl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharper the dragons bite and sting!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric the son of Hakon Jarl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A death-drink salt as the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pledges to thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olaf the King!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EINAR TAMBERSKELVER

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Einar Tamberskelver
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood beside the mast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his yew-bow, tipped with silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew the arrows fast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aimed at Eric unavailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sat concealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half behind the quarter-railing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half behind his shield.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First an arrow struck the tiller,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just above his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sing, O Eyvind Skaldaspiller,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Earl Eric said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sing the song of Hakon dying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing his funeral wail!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another arrow flying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grazed his coat of mail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to a Lapland yeoman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the arrow passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Earl Eric, "Shoot that bowman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing by the mast."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner than the word was spoken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew the yeoman's shaft;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einar's bow in twain was broken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einar only laughed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was that?" said Olaf, standing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quarter-deck.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Something heard I like the stranding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a shattered wreck."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einar then, the arrow taking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the loosened string,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered, "That was Norway breaking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thy hand, O King!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art but a poor diviner,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway Olaf said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my bow, and swifter, Einar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let thy shafts be sped."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his bows the fairest choosing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reached he from above;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Einar saw the blood-drops oozing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through his iron glove.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bow was thin and narrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first assay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er its head he drew the arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flung the bow away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, with hot and angry temper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flushing in his cheek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Olaf! for so great a Kamper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are thy bows too weak!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with smile of joy defiant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his beardless lip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scaled he, light and self-reliant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric's dragon-ship.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loose his golden locks were flowing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright his armor gleamed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Saint Michael overthrowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucifer he seemed.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day has the battle raged,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day have the ships engaged,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not yet is assuaged
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vengeance of Eric the Earl.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decks with blood are red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrows of death are sped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ships are filled with the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the spears the champions hurl.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They drift as wrecks on the tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grappling-irons are plied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boarders climb up the side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouts are feeble and few.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! never shall Norway again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See her sailors come back o'er the main;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all lie wounded or slain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or asleep in the billows blue!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the deck stands Olaf the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around him whistle and sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spears that the foemen fling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stones they hurl with their hands.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of the stones and the spears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kolbiorn, the marshal, appears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shield in the air he uprears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the side of King Olaf he stands.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the slippery wreck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Long Serpent's deck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeps Eric with hardly a check,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lips with anger are pale;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hews with his axe at the mast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it falls, with the sails overcast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a snow-covered pine in the vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim forests of Orkadale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking King Olaf then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushes aft with his men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a hunter into the den
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bear, when he stands at bay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember Jarl Hakon!" he cries;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lo! on his wondering eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two kingly figures arise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Olaf's in warlike array!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Kolbiorn speaks in the ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of King Olaf a word of cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a whisper that none may hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile on his tremulous lip;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two shields raised high in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two flashes of golden hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two scarlet meteors' glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both have leaped from the ship.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl Eric's men in the boats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seize Kolbiorn's shield as it floats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cry, from their hairy throats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See! it is Olaf the King!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While far on the opposite side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floats another shield on the tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a jewel set in the wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-current's eddying ring.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is told a wonderful tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the King stripped off his mail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like leaves of the brown sea-kale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he swam beneath the main;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the young grew old and gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never, by night or by day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his kingdom of Norroway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was King Olaf seen again!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE NUN OF NIDAROS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the convent of Drontheim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone in her chamber
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt Astrid the Abbess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight, adoring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beseeching, entreating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Virgin and Mother.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard in the silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of one speaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gusts of the night-wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now louder, now nearer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now lost in the distance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of a stranger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed as she listened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some one who answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beseeching, imploring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cry from afar off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not distinguish.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Saint John,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beloved disciple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wandered and waited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master's appearance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsheltered and friendless.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is accepted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry defiance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge of battle!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is accepted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not with the weapons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of war that thou wieldest!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cross against corselet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love against hatred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace-cry for war-cry!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience is powerful;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He that o'ercometh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath power o'er the nations!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As torrents in summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half dried in their channels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly rise, though the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky is still cloudless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rain has been falling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off at their fountains;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So hearts that are fainting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow full to o'erflowing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they that behold it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvel, and know not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That God at their fountains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off has been raining!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stronger than steel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the sword of the Spirit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter than arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the truth is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater than anger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is love, and subdueth!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art a phantom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shape of the sea-mist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shape of the brumal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain, and the darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearful and formless;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day dawns and thou art not!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dawn is not distant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is the night starless;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is eternal!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is still God, and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His faith shall not fail us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ is eternal!"




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strain of music closed the tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A low, monotonous, funeral wail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with its cadence, wild and sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the long Saga more complete.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank God," the Theologian said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reign of violence is dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or dying surely from the world;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Love triumphant reigns instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a brighter sky o'erhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blessed banners are unfurled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most of all thank God for this:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war and waste of clashing creeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now end in words, and not in deeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no one suffers loss, or bleeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thoughts that men call heresies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I stand without here in the porch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the bell's melodious din,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the organ peal within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the prayer, with words that scorch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sparks from an inverted torch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the sermon upon sin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With threatenings of the last account.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all, translated in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach me but as our dear Lord's Prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the Sermon on the Mount.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must it be Calvin, and not Christ?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must it be Athanasian creeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or holy water, books, and beads?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must struggling souls remain content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With councils and decrees of Trend?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can it be enough for these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christian Church the year embalms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With evergreens and boughs of palms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fills the air with litanies?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that yonder Pharisee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks God that he is not like me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my humiliation dressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only stand and beat my breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pray for human charity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not to one church alone, but seven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice prophetic spake from heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unto each the promise came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversified, but still the same;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him that overcometh are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new name written on the stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raiment white, the crown, the throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will give him the Morning Star!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! to how many Faith has been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No evidence of things unseen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a dim shadow, that recasts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creed of the Phantasiasts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whom no Man of Sorrows died,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whom the Tragedy Divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was but a symbol and a sign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Christ a phantom crucified!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For others a diviner creed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is living in the life they lead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of their beautiful feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blesses the pavement of the street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all their looks and words repeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Fuller's saying, wise and sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as a vulture, but a dove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Ghost came from above.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this brings back to me a tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sad the hearer well may quail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And question if such things can be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in the chronicles of Spain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the dark pages runs this stain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And naught can wash them white again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fearful is the tragedy."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE THEOLOGIAN'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TORQUEMADA

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heroic days when Ferdinand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Isabella ruled the Spanish land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Torquemada, with his subtle brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruled them, as Grand Inquisitor of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a great castle near Valladolid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moated and high and by fair woodlands hid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There dwelt as from the chronicles we learn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old Hidalgo proud and taciturn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose name has perished, with his towers of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his actions save this one alone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one, so terrible, perhaps 't were best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it, too, were forgotten with the rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, perchance, our eyes can see therein
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The martyrdom triumphant o'er the sin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A double picture, with its gloom and glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendor overhead, the death below.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sombre man counted each day as lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which his feet no sacred threshold crossed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he chanced the passing Host to meet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knelt and prayed devoutly in the street;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft he confessed; and with each mutinous thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with wild beasts at Ephesus, he fought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deep contrition scourged himself in Lent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked in processions, with his head down bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At plays of Corpus Christi oft was seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on Palm Sunday bore his bough of green.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sole diversion was to hunt the boar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through tangled thickets of the forest hoar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or with his jingling mules to hurry down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some grand bull-fight in the neighboring town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in the crowd with lighted taper stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jews were burned, or banished from the land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then stirred within him a tumultuous joy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon whose delight is to destroy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook him, and shouted with a trumpet tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill! kill! and let the Lord find out his own!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, in that old castle in the wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughters, in the dawn of womanhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning from their convent school, had made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resplendent with their bloom the forest shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminding him of their dead mother's face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first she came into that gloomy place,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A memory in his heart as dim and sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As moonlight in a solitary street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the same rays, that lift the sea, are thrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely but powerless upon walls of stone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two fair daughters of a mother dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were all the dream had left him as it fled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A joy at first, and then a growing care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a voice within him cried, "Beware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vague presentiment of impending doom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like ghostly footsteps in a vacant room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunted him day and night; a formless fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That death to some one of his house was near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dark surmises of a hidden crime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made life itself a death before its time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous, suspicious, with no sense of shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spy upon his daughters he became;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With velvet slippers, noiseless on the floors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glided softly through half-open doors;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the room, and now upon the stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood beside them ere they were aware;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened in the passage when they talked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched them from the casement when they walked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the gypsy haunt the river's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the monk among the cork-trees glide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, tortured by the mystery and the doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some dark secret, past his finding out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baffled he paused; then reassured again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursued the flying phantom of his brain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched them even when they knelt in church;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, descending lower in his search,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questioned the servants, and with eager eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened incredulous to their replies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gypsy? none had seen her in the wood!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk? a mendicant in search of food!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length the awful revelation came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crushing at once his pride of birth and name;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hopes his yearning bosom forward cast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ancestral glories of the vast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fell together, crumbling in disgrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A turret rent from battlement to base.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughters talking in the dead of night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their own chamber, and without a light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening, as he was wont, he overheard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learned the dreadful secret, word by word;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurrying from his castle, with a cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hands to the unpitying sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeating one dread word, till bush and tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught it, and shuddering answered, "Heresy!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in his cloak, his hat drawn o'er his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now hurrying forward, now with lingering pace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked all night the alleys of his park,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one unseen companion in the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Demon who within him lay in wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by his presence turned his love to hate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever muttering in an undertone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill! kill! and let the Lord find out his own!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the morrow, after early Mass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet the dew was glistening on the grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the woods were musical with birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Hidalgo, uttering fearful words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked homeward with the Priest, and in his room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned his trembling daughters to their doom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When questioned, with brief answers they replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor when accused evaded or denied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expostulations, passionate appeals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that the human heart most fears or feels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain the Priest with earnest voice essayed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain the father threatened, wept, and prayed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last he said, with haughty mien,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Office, then, must intervene!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the Grand Inquisitor of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the fifty horsemen of his train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His awful name resounding, like the blast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of funeral trumpets, as he onward passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to Valladolid, and there began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To harry the rich Jews with fire and ban.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him the Hidalgo went, and at the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demanded audience on affairs of state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a secret chamber stood before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A venerable graybeard of fourscore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed in the hood and habit of a friar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of his eyes flashed a consuming fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his hand the mystic horn he held,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which poison and all noxious charms dispelled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard in silence the Hidalgo's tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then answered in a voice that made him quail:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son of the Church! when Abraham of old
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sacrifice his only son was told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pause to parley nor protest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hastened to obey the Lord's behest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In him it was accounted righteousness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Church expects of thee no less!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sacred frenzy seized the father's brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mercy from that hour implored in vain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! who will e'er believe the words I say?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughters he accused, and the same day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both were cast into the dungeon's gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dismal antechamber of the tomb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arraigned, condemned, and sentenced to the flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret torture and the public shame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the Grand Inquisitor once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hidalgo went, more eager than before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "When Abraham offered up his son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clave the wood wherewith it might be done.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his example taught, let me too bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood from the forest for my offering!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the deep voice, without a pause, replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son of the Church! by faith now justified,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete thy sacrifice, even as thou wilt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church absolves thy conscience from all guilt!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this most wretched father went his way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the woods, that round his castle lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where once his daughters in their childhood played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their young mother in the sun and shade.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all the leaves had fallen; the branches bare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a perpetual moaning in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And screaming from their eyries overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ravens sailed athwart the sky of lead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his own hands he lopped the boughs and bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fagots, that crackled with foreboding sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on his mules, caparisoned and gay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bells and tassels, sent them on their way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with his mind on one dark purpose bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again to the Inquisitor he went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "Behold, the fagots I have brought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, lest my atonement be as naught,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant me one more request, one last desire,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my own hand to light the funeral fire!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Torquemada answered from his seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son of the Church!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine offering is complete;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her servants through all ages shall not cease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To magnify thy deed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depart in peace!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the market-place, builded of stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scaffold rose, whereon Death claimed his own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the four corners, in stern attitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four statues of the Hebrew Prophets stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing with calm indifference in their eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon this place of human sacrifice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round which was gathering fast the eager crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With clamor of voices dissonant and loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every roof and window was alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With restless gazers, swarming like a hive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church-bells tolled, the chant of monks drew near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line of torches smoked along the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a stir, a rush, a tramp of feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with its banners floating in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly the long procession crossed the square,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, to the statues of the Prophets bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims stood, with fagots piled around.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all the air a blast of trumpets shook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And louder sang the monks with bell and book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Hidalgo, lofty, stern, and proud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted his torch, and, bursting through the crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted in haste the fagots, and then fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest those imploring eyes should strike him dead!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O pitiless skies! why did your clouds retain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For peasants' fields their floods of hoarded rain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O pitiless earth! why open no abyss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bury in its chasm a crime like this?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night a mingled column of fire and smoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prom the dark thickets of the forest broke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, glaring o'er the landscape leagues away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made all the fields and hamlets bright as day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in a sheet of flame the castle blazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the villagers in terror gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the figure of that cruel knight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean from a window in the turret's height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ghastly face illumined with the glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands upraised above his head in prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the floor sank beneath him, and he fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the black hollow of that burning well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three centuries and more above his bones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have piled the oblivious years like funeral stones;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name has perished with him, and no trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remains on earth of his afflicted race;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Torquemada's name, with clouds o'ercast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looms in the distant landscape of the Past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a burnt tower upon a blackened heath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit by the fires of burning woods beneath!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus closed the tale of guilt and gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cast upon each listener's face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its shadow, and for some brief space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbroken silence filled the room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jew was thoughtful and distressed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his memory thronged and pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persecution of his race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wrongs and sufferings and disgrace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head was sunk upon his breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from his eyes alternate came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashes of wrath and tears of shame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student first the silence broke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who long has lain in wait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With purpose to retaliate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus he dealt the avenging stroke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In such a company as this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale so tragic seems amiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That by its terrible control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ermasters and drags down the soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a fathomless abyss.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Italian Tales that you disdain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some merry Night of Straparole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Machiavelli's Belphagor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would cheer us and delight us more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give greater pleasure and less pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than your grim tragedies of Spain!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here the Poet raised his hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such entreaty and command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stopped discussion at its birth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "The story I shall tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has meaning in it, if not mirth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, and hear what once befell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merry birds of Killingworth!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE POET'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the season, when through all the land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merle and mavis build, and building sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those lovely lyrics, written by His hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom Saxon Caedmon calls the Blitheheart King;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the boughs the purple buds expand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banners of the vanguard of the Spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rivulets, rejoicing, rush and leap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wave their fluttering signals from the steep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robin and the bluebird, piping loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled all the blossoming orchards with their glee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparrows chirped as if they still were proud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their race in Holy Writ should mentioned be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hungry crows assembled in a crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clamored their piteous prayer incessantly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing who hears the ravens cry, and said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give us, O Lord, this day our daily bread!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Sound the birds of passage sailed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking some unknown language strange and sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tropic isle remote, and passing hailed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village with the cheers of all their fleet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or quarrelling together, laughed and railed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like foreign sailors, landed in the street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of seaport town, and with outlandish noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of oaths and gibberish frightening girls and boys.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus came the jocund Spring in Killingworth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fabulous day; some hundred years ago;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrifty farmers, as they tilled the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard with alarm the cawing of the crow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mingled with the universal mirth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassandra-like, prognosticating woe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shook their heads, and doomed with dreadful words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To swift destruction the whole race of birds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a town-meeting was convened straightway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set a price upon the guilty heads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these marauders, who, in lieu of pay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levied black-mail upon the garden beds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cornfields, and beheld without dismay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awful scarecrow, with his fluttering shreds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skeleton that waited at their feast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereby their sinful pleasure was increased.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from his house, a temple painted white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fluted columns, and a roof of red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Squire came forth, august and splendid sight!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly descending, with majestic tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three flights of steps, nor looking left nor right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the long street he walked, as one who said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A town that boasts inhabitants like me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can have no lack of good society!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parson, too, appeared, a man austere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instinct of whose nature was to kill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of God he preached from year to year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And read, with fervor, Edwards on the Will;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His favorite pastime was to slay the deer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Summer on some Adirondac hill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en now, while walking down the rural lane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lopped the wayside lilies with his cane.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Academy, whose belfry crowned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hill of Science with its vane of brass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the Preceptor, gazing idly round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at the clouds, and now at the green grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all absorbed in reveries profound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fair Almira in the upper class,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was, as in a sonnet he had said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pure as water, and as good as bread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next the Deacon issued from his door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his voluminous neck-cloth, white as snow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suit of sable bombazine he wore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His form was ponderous, and his step was slow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There never was so wise a man before;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed the incarnate "Well, I told you so!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to perpetuate his great renown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a street named after him in town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These came together in the new town-hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sundry farmers from the region round.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Squirt presided, dignified and tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His air impressive and his reasoning sound;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill fared it with the birds, both great and small;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly a friend in all that crowd they found,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But enemies enough, who every one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charged them with all the crimes beneath the sun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they had ended, from his place apart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the Preceptor, to redress the wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, trembling like a steed before the start,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked round bewildered on the expectant throng;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thought of fair Almira, and took heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak out what was in him, clear and strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike regardless of their smile or frown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quite determined not to be laughed down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plato, anticipating the Reviewers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his Republic banished without pity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poets; in this little town of yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You put to death, by means of a Committee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ballad-singers and the Troubadours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street-musicians of the heavenly city,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds, who make sweet music for us all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our dark hours, as David did for Saul.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thrush that carols at the dawn of day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the green steeples of the piny wood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oriole in the elm; the noisy jay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jargoning like a foreigner at his food;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bluebird balanced on some topmost spray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding with melody the neighborhood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linnet and meadow-lark, and all the throng
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dwell in nests, and have the gift of song.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You slay them all! and wherefore! for the gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a scant handful more or less of wheat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rye, or barley, or some other grain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scratched up at random by industrious feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searching for worm or weevil after rain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a few cherries, that are not so sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As are the songs these uninvited guests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing at their feast with comfortable breasts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you ne'er think what wondrous beings these?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you ne'er think who made them and who taught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dialect they speak, where melodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone are the interpreters of thought?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose household words are songs in many keys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter than instrument of man e'er caught!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose habitations in the tree-tops even
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are half-way houses on the road to heaven!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think, every morning when the sun peeps through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim, leaf-latticed windows of the grove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How jubilant the happy birds renew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their old, melodious madrigals of love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you think of this, remember too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is always morning somewhere, and above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awakening continent; from shore to shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere the birds are singing evermore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think of your woods and orchards without birds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in an idiot's brain remembered words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang empty 'mid the cobwebs of his dreams!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will bleat of flocks or bellowing of herds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make up for the lost music, when your teams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag home the stingy harvest, and no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feathered gleaners follow to your door?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What! would you rather see the incessant stir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of insects in the windrows of the hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the locust and the grasshopper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their melancholy hurdy-gurdies play?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this more pleasant to you than the whir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of meadow-lark, and her sweet roundelay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or twitter of little field-fares, as you take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your nooning in the shade of bush and brake?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You call them thieves and pillagers; but know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the winged wardens of your farms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from the cornfields drive the insidious foe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from your harvests keep a hundred harms;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the blackest of them all, the crow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renders good service as your man-at-arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crushing the beetle in his coat of mail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crying havoc on the slug and snail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I teach your children gentleness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mercy to the weak, and reverence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Life, which, in its weakness or excess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is still a gleam of God's omnipotence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Death, which, seeming darkness, is no less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selfsame light, although averted hence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When by your laws, your actions, and your speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You contradict the very things I teach?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this he closed; and through the audience went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A murmur, like the rustle of dead leaves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers laughed and nodded, and some bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their yellow heads together like their sheaves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men have no faith in fine-spun sentiment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who put their trust in bullocks and in beeves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds were doomed; and, as the record shows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bounty offered for the heads of crows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another audience out of reach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had no voice nor vote in making laws,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the papers read his little speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crowned his modest temples with applause;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made him conscious, each one more than each,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still was victor, vanquished in their cause.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetest of all the applause he won from thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O fair Almira at the Academy!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the dreadful massacre began;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er fields and orchards, and o'er woodland crests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceaseless fusillade of terror ran.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead fell the birds, with blood-stains on their breasts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wounded crept away from sight of man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the young died of famine in their nests;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slaughter to be told in groans, not words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very St. Bartholomew of Birds!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summer came, and all the birds were dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days were like hot coals; the very ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was burned to ashes; in the orchards fed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myriads of caterpillars, and around
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultivated fields and garden beds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hosts of devouring insects crawled, and found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No foe to check their march, till they had made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land a desert without leaf or shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devoured by worms, like Herod, was the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, like Herod, it had ruthlessly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaughtered the Innocents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the trees spun down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The canker-worms upon the passers-by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon each woman's bonnet, shawl, and gown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shook them off with just a little cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were the terror of each favorite walk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless theme of all the village talk.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers grew impatient but a few
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confessed their error, and would not complain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For after all, the best thing one can do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is raining, is to let it rain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they repealed the law, although they knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not call the dead to life again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As school-boys, finding their mistake too late,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw a wet sponge across the accusing slate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That year in Killingworth the Autumn came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the light of his majestic look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonder of the falling tongues of flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illumined pages of his Doom's-Day book.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few lost leaves blushed crimson with their shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drowned themselves despairing in the brook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the wild wind went moaning everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamenting the dead children of the air!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next Spring a stranger sight was seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sight that never yet by bard was sung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As great a wonder as it would have been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If some dumb animal had found a tongue!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wagon, overarched with evergreen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon whose boughs were wicker cages hung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All full of singing birds, came down the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the air with music wild and sweet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the country round these birds were brought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By order of the town, with anxious quest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, loosened from their wicker prisons, sought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In woods and fields the places they loved best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing loud canticles, which many thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were satires to the authorities addressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While others, listening in green lanes, averred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such lovely music never had been heard!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But blither still and louder carolled they
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the morrow, for they seemed to know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the fair Almira's wedding-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everywhere, around, above, below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Preceptor bore his bride away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their songs burst forth in joyous overflow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a new heaven bent over a new earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the sunny farms of Killingworth.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FINALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour was late; the fire burned low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord's eyes were closed in sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And near the story's end a deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonorous sound at times was heard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the distant bagpipes blow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this all laughed; the Landlord stirred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one awaking from a swound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, gazing anxiously around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protested that he had not slept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only shut his eyes, and kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ears attentive to each word.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all arose, and said "Good Night."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone remained the drowsy Squire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rake the embers of the fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quench the waning parlor light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from the windows, here and there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattered lamps a moment gleamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the illumined hostel seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constellation of the Bear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downward, athwart the misty air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking and setting toward the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off the village clock struck one.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PART SECOND

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRELUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold, uninterrupted rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That washed each southern window-pane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a river of the road;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sea of mist that overflowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house, the barns, the gilded vane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drowned the upland and the plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through which the oak-trees, broad and high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like phantom ships went drifting by;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, hidden behind a watery screen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun unseen, or only seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a faint pallor in the sky;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus cold and colorless and gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morn of that autumnal day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if reluctant to begin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawned on the silent Sudbury Inn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the guests that in it lay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full late they slept.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge of Sir Chanticleer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who on the empty threshing-floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disdainful of the rain outside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was strutting with a martial stride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if upon his thigh he wore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous broadsword of the Squire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "Behold me, and admire!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Poet seemed to hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drowse or dream, more near and near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the border-land of sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blowing of a blithesome horn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That laughed the dismal day to scorn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A splash of hoofs and rush of wheels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sand and mire like stranding keels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the road with sudden sweep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mail drove up the little steep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stopped beside the tavern door;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment stopped, and then again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With crack of whip and bark of dog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged forward through the sea of fog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all was silent as before,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All silent save the dripping rain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then one by one the guests came down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And greeted with a smile the Squire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sat before the parlor fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the paper fresh from town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First the Sicilian, like a bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his form appeared, was heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling and singing down the stair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the Student, with a look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As placid as a meadow-brook;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian, still perplexed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thoughts of this world and the next;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet then, as one who seems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in visions and in dreams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Musician, like a fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperion from whose golden hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance of the morning streams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And last the aromatic Jew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Alicant, who, as he threw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door wide open, on the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed round about him a perfume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of damask roses in full bloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a garden of the room.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakfast ended, each pursued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promptings of his various mood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the fire in silence smoked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taciturn, impassive Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in a pleasant revery;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, by his gravity provoked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His portrait the Sicilian drew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrote beneath it "Edrehi,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Red Horse in Sudbury."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By far the busiest of them all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian in the hall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was feeding robins in a cage,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two corpulent and lazy birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vagrants and pilferers at best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one might trust the hostler's words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief instrument of their arrest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two poets of the Golden Age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heirs of a boundless heritage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fields and orchards, east and west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sunshine of long summer days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though outlawed now and dispossessed!--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the Theologian's phrase.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Student held discourse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Musician, on the source
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the legendary lore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the nations, scattered wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like silt and seaweed by the force
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fluctuation of the tide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tale repeated o'er and o'er,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With change of place and change of name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disguised, transformed, and yet the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've heard a hundred times before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet at the window mused,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw, as in a dream confused,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countenance of the Sun, discrowned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And haggard with a pale despair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the cloud-rack trail and drift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it, and the trees uplift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their leafless branches, and the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with the arrows of the rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard amid the mist below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like voices of distress and pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That haunt the thoughts of men insane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fateful cawings of the crow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then down the road, with mud besprent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drenched with rain from head to hoof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain-drops dripping from his mane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tail as from a pent-house roof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jaded horse, his head down bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed slowly, limping as he went.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Sicilian--who had grown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impatient longer to abide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prisoner, greatly mortified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see completely overthrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plans for angling in the brook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, leaning o'er the bridge of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch the speckled trout glide by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And float through the inverted sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still round and round the baited hook--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now paced the room with rapid stride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, pausing at the Poet's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked forth, and saw the wretched steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "Alas for human greed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with cold hand and stony eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus turns an old friend out to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or beg his food from gate to gate!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings a tale into my mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, if you are not disinclined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To listen, I will now relate."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All gave assent; all wished to hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not without many a jest and jeer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of a spavined steed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the Student with the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put in his pleasant little jest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Malherbe, that Pegasus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but a horse that with all speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bears poets to the hospital;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Sicilian, self-possessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment's interval
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Began his simple story thus.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SICILIAN'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BELL OF ATRI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Atri in Abruzzo, a small town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ancient Roman date, but scant renown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of those little places that have run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half up the hill, beneath a blazing sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then sat down to rest, as if to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I climb no farther upward, come what may,"--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Re Giovanni, now unknown to fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many monarchs since have borne the name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a great bell hung in the market-place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a roof, projecting some small space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of shelter from the sun and rain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rode he through the streets with all his train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with the blast of trumpets loud and long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made proclamation, that whenever wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was done to any man, he should but ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great bell in the square, and he, the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would cause the Syndic to decide thereon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the proclamation of King John.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How swift the happy days in Atri sped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wrongs were righted, need not here be said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it that, as all things must decay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hempen rope at length was worn away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unravelled at the end, and, strand by strand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loosened and wasted in the ringer's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till one, who noted this in passing by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mended the rope with braids of briony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the leaves and tendrils of the vine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung like a votive garland at a shrine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By chance it happened that in Atri dwelt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight, with spur on heel and sword in belt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved to hunt the wild-boar in the woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved his falcons with their crimson hoods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved his hounds and horses, and all sports
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prodigalities of camps and courts;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved, or had loved them; for at last, grown old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only passion was the love of gold.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sold his horses, sold his hawks and hounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rented his vineyards and his garden-grounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept but one steed, his favorite steed of all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To starve and shiver in a naked stall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And day by day sat brooding in his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devising plans how best to hoard and spare.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length he said: "What is the use or need
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep at my own cost this lazy steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eating his head off in my stables here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When rents are low and provender is dear?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him go feed upon the public ways;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want him only for the holidays."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the old steed was turned into the heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the long, lonely, silent, shadeless street;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wandered in suburban lanes forlorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barked at by dogs, and torn by brier and thorn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One afternoon, as in that sultry clime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the custom in the summer time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bolted doors and window-shutters closed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inhabitants of Atri slept or dozed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When suddenly upon their senses fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud alarum of the accusing bell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Syndic started from his deep repose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned on his couch, and listened, and then rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And donned his robes, and with reluctant pace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went panting forth into the market-place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the great bell upon its cross-beam swung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reiterating with persistent tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half-articulate jargon, the old song:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some one hath done a wrong, hath done a wrong!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ere he reached the belfry's light arcade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw, or thought he saw, beneath its shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No shape of human form of woman born,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a poor steed dejected and forlorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who with uplifted head and eager eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was tugging at the vines of briony.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Domeneddio!" cried the Syndie straight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the Knight of Atri's steed of state!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calls for justice, being sore distressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pleads his cause as loudly as the best."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile from street and lane a noisy crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had rolled together like a summer cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told the story of the wretched beast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In five-and-twenty different ways at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With much gesticulation and appeal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To heathen gods, in their excessive zeal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight was called and questioned; in reply
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not confess the fact, did not deny;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treated the matter as a pleasant jest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set at naught the Syndic and the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining, in an angry undertone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he should do what pleased him with his own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereupon the Syndic gravely read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proclamation of the King; then said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pride goeth forth on horseback grand and gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cometh back on foot, and begs its way;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fame is the fragrance of heroic deeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowers of chivalry and not of weeds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are familiar proverbs; but I fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never yet have reached your knightly ear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What fair renown, what honor, what repute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can come to you from starving this poor brute?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who serves well and speaks not, merits more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than they who clamor loudest at the door.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the law decrees that as this steed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Served you in youth, henceforth you shall take heed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To comfort his old age, and to provide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelter in stall an food and field beside."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight withdrew abashed; the people all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led home the steed in triumph to his stall.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King heard and approved, and laughed in glee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cried aloud: "Right well it pleaseth me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Church-bells at best but ring us to the door;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But go not in to mass; my bell doth more:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cometh into court and pleads the cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of creatures dumb and unknown to the laws;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this shall make, in every Christian clime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bell of Atri famous for all time."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, well your story pleads the cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those dumb mouths that have no speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a cry from each to each
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its own kind, with its own laws;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that is beyond the reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human power to learn or teach,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inarticulate moan of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the immeasurable main
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking upon an unknown beach."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus spake the Poet with a sigh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then added, with impassioned cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who feels the words he speaks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color flushing in his cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fervor burning in his eye:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Among the noblest in the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he may count himself the least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That man I honor and revere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who without favor, without fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great city dares to stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friend of every friendless beast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tames with his unflinching hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brutes that wear our form and face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The were-wolves of the human race!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then paused, and waited with a frown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some old champion of romance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, having thrown his gauntlet down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expectant leans upon his lance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But neither Knight nor Squire is found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise the gauntlet from the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And try with him the battle's chance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake from your dreams, O Edrehi!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or dreaming speak to us, and make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feint of being half awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell us what your dreams may be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the hazy atmosphere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cloud-land deign to reappear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among us in this Wayside Inn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us what visions and what scenes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illuminate the dark ravines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which you grope your way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Sicilian spake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made no reply, but only smiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men unto a wayward child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not knowing what to answer, do.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a cavern's mouth, o'ergrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With moss and intertangled vines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A streamlet leaps into the light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmurs over root and stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a melodious undertone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as amid the noonday night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sombre and wind-haunted pines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There runs a sound as of the sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from his bearded lips there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A melody without a name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A song, a tale, a history,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or whatsoever it may be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ and recorded in these lines.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SPANISH JEW'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KAMBALU

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the city of Kambalu,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the road that leadeth to Ispahan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the head of his dusty caravan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laden with treasure from realms afar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baldacca and Kelat and Kandahar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode the great captain Alau.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Khan from his palace-window gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw in the thronging street beneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the setting sun, that blazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the clouds of dust by the caravan raised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flash of harness and jewelled sheath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shining scymitars of the guard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weary camels that bared their teeth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they passed and passed through the gates unbarred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the shade of the palace-yard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus into the city of Kambalu
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode the great captain Alau;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he stood before the Khan, and said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemies of my lord are dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Kalifs of all the West
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow and obey thy least behest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plains are dark with the mulberry-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weavers are busy in Samarcand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miners are sifting the golden sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divers plunging for pearls in the seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And peace and plenty are in the land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baldacca's Kalif, and he alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose in revolt against thy throne:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His treasures are at thy palace-door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the swords and the shawls and the jewels he wore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body is dust o'er the desert blown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A mile outside of Baldacca's gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left my forces to lie in wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concealed by forests and hillocks of sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forward dashed with a handful of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lure the old tiger from his den
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the ambush I had planned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere we reached the town the alarm was spread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we heard the sound of gongs from within;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with clash of cymbals and warlike din
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates swung wide; and we turned and fled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the garrison sallied forth and pursued,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gray old Kalif at their head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above them the banner of Mohammed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we snared them all, and the town was subdued.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As in at the gate we rode, behold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tower that is called the Tower of Gold!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there the Kalif had hidden his wealth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaped and hoarded and piled on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sacks of wheat in a granary;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thither the miser crept by stealth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel of the gold that gave him health,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to gaze and gloat with his hungry eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On jewels that gleamed like a glow-worm's spark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the eyes of a panther in the dark.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said to the Kalif: 'Thou art old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast no need of so much gold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shouldst not have heaped and hidden it here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the breath of battle was hot and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But have sown through the land these useless hoards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spring into shining blades of swords,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep thine honor sweet and clear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These grains of gold are not grains of wheat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bars of silver thou canst not eat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These jewels and pearls and precious stones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot cure the aches in thy bones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor keep the feet of Death one hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From climbing the stairways of thy tower!'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then into his dungeon I locked the drone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him to feed there all alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the honey-cells of his golden hive:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never a prayer, nor a cry, nor a groan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heard from those massive walls of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor again was the Kalif seen alive!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When at last we unlocked the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We found him dead upon the floor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rings had dropped from his withered hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His teeth were like bones in the desert sands:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still clutching his treasure he had died;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he lay there, he appeared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statue of gold with a silver beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arms outstretched as if crucified."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the story, strange and true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the great captain Alau
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told to his brother the Tartar Khan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he rode that day into Kambalu
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the road that leadeth to Ispahan.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought before your tale began,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student murmured, "we should have
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some legend written by Judah Rav
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Gemara of Babylon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or something from the Gulistan,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tale of the Cazy of Hamadan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of that King of Khorasan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who saw in dreams the eyes of one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had a hundred years been dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still moving restless in his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undimmed, and gleaming with the lust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of power, though all the rest was dust.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But lo! your glittering caravan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road that leadeth to Ispahan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath led us farther to the East
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the regions of Cathay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spite of your Kalif and his gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant has been the tale you told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full of color; that at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will question or gainsay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet on such a dismal day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a merrier tale to clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark and heavy atmosphere.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So listen, Lordlings, while I tell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a preface, what befell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple cobbler, in the year --
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter; it was long ago;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is all we need to know."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE STUDENT'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that somewhere and somehow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You all have heard of Hagenau,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet, quaint, and ancient town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the green Alsatian hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place of valleys, streams, and mills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Barbarossa's castle, brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rust of centuries, still looks down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the broad, drowsy land below,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On shadowy forests filled with game,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the blue river winding slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through meadows, where the hedges grow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That give this little town its name.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened in the good old times,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet the Master-singers filled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noisy workshop and the guild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With various melodies and rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That here in Hagenau there dwelt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cobbler,--one who loved debate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, arguing from a postulate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would say what others only felt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of forecast and of thrift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of a shrewd and careful mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world's business, but inclined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat to let the next world drift.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hans Sachs with vast delight he read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Regenbogen's rhymes of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For their poetic fame had spread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to the town of Hagenau;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some Quick Melody of the Plough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Double Harmony of the Dove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was always running in his head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept, moreover, at his side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among his leathers and his tools,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reynard the Fox, the Ship of Fools,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Eulenspiegel, open wide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these he was much edified:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought them wiser than the Schools.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His good wife, full of godly fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liked not these worldly themes to hear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Psalter was her book of songs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only music to her ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that which to the Church belongs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the loud choir on Sunday chanted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the two angels carved in wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That by the windy organ stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew on their trumpets loud and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the echoes, far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibbered as if the church were haunted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside his door, one afternoon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This humble votary of the muse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat in the narrow strip of shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a projecting cornice made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mending the Burgomaster's shoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And singing a familiar tune:--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our ingress into the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was naked and bare;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our progress through the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is trouble and care;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our egress from the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will be nobody knows where;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we do well here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall do well there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I could tell you no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should I preach a whole year!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus sang the cobbler at his work;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with his gestures marked the time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing together with a jerk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his waxed thread the stitch and rhyme.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile his quiet little dame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was leaning o'er the window-sill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eager, excited, but mouse-still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing impatiently to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the great throng of folk might be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That onward in procession came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the unfrequented street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With horns that blew, and drums that beat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And banners flying, and the flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tapers, and, at times, the sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of nuns; and as they sang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly all the church-bells rang.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a gay coach, above the crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There sat a monk in ample hood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who with his right hand held aloft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A red and ponderous cross of wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which at times he meekly bowed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front three horsemen rode, and oft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With voice and air importunate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boisterous herald cried aloud:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The grace of God is at your gate!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So onward to the church they passed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cobbler slowly tuned his last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, wagging his sagacious head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto his kneeling housewife said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis the monk Tetzel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cawings of that reverend bird.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't let him cheat you of your gold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulgence is not bought and sold."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church of Hagenau, that night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was full of people, full of light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An odor of incense filled the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest intoned, the organ groaned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its inarticulate despair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candles on the altar blazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full in front of it upraised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red cross stood against the glare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below, upon the altar-rail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulgences were set to sale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like ballads at a country fair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy strong-box, iron-bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carved with many a quaint device,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received, with a melodious sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coin that purchased Paradise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from the pulpit overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tetzel the monk, with fiery glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thundered upon the crowd below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good people all, draw near!" he said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Purchase these letters, signed and sealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By which all sins, though unrevealed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unrepented, are forgiven!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count but the gain, count not the loss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your gold and silver are but dross,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet they pave the way to heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear your mothers and your sires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry from their purgatorial fires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will ye not their ransom pay?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O senseless people! when the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heaven is open, will ye wait?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will ye not enter in to-day?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow it will be too late;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be gone upon my way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make haste! bring money while ye may!'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women shuddered, and turned pale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allured by hope or driven by fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a sob and many a tear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All crowded to the altar-rail.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pieces of silver and of gold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the tinkling strong-box fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like pebbles dropped into a well;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon the ballads were all sold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cobbler's wife among the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slipped into the capacious chest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden florin; then withdrew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding the paper in her breast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And homeward through the darkness went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comforted, quieted, content;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not walk, she rather flew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dove that settles to her nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some appalling bird of prey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scared her has been driven away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days went by, the monk was gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer passed, the winter came;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though seasons changed, yet still the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily round of life went on;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily round of household care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow life of toil and prayer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in her heart the cobbler's dame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had now a treasure beyond price,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secret joy without a name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certainty of Paradise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, alas!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust unto dust!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the winter wore away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her body in the churchyard lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her patient soul was with the Just!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After her death, among the things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That even the poor preserve with care,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some little trinkets and cheap rings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A locket with her mother's hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wedding gown, the faded flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore upon her wedding day,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these memories of past hours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That so much of the heart reveal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully kept and put away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Letter of Indulgence lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folded, with signature and seal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Priest, aggrieved and pained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited and wondered that no word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mass or requiem he heard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As by the Holy Church ordained;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the Magistrate complained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That as this woman had been dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week or more, and no mass said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was rank heresy, or at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contempt of Church; thus said the Priest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight the cobbler was arraigned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came, confiding in his cause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rather doubtful of the laws.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Justice from his elbow-chair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave him a look that seemed to say:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou standest before a Magistrate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore do not prevaricate!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then asked him in a business way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly but cold: "Is thy wife dead?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cobbler meekly bowed his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is," came struggling from his throat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce audibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Justice wrote
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words down in a book, and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued, as he raised his pen:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is; and hath a mass been said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the salvation of her soul?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, speak the truth! confess the whole!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cobbler without pause replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of mass or prayer there was no need;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For at the moment when she died
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her soul was with the glorified!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from his pocket with all speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew the priestly title-deed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prayed the Justice he would read.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Justice read, amused, amazed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he read his mirth increased;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times his shaggy brows he raised,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now wondering at the cobbler gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now archly at the angry Priest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From all excesses, sins, and crimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast committed in past times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee I absolve!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And furthermore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purified from all earthly taints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the communion of the Saints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the sacraments restore!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stains of weakness, and all trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shame and censure I efface;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remit the pains thou shouldst endure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make thee innocent and pure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that in dying, unto thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of heaven shall open be!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though long thou livest, yet this grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the moment of thy death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unchangeable continueth!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said he to the Priest: "I find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This document is duly signed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother John Tetzel, his own hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all tribunals in the land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In evidence it may be used;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore acquitted is the accused."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the cobbler turned: "My friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray tell me, didst thou ever read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reynard the Fox?"--"O yes, indeed!"--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget the end."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was the end?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ashamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to remember Reynard's fate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not read the book of late;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was he not hanged?" the Poet said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student gravely shook his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And answered: "You exaggerate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tournament proclaimed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Reynard fought with Isegrim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wolf, and having vanquished him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose to high honor in the State,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Keeper of the Seals was named!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this the gay Sicilian laughed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fight fire with fire, and craft with craft;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful cunning seems to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of your tale," said he.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mine had a better, and the Jew's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had none at all, that I could see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His aim was only to amuse."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile from out its ebon case
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His violin the Minstrel drew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having tuned its strings anew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now held it close in his embrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poising in his outstretched hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow, like a magician's wand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, and said, with beaming face:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night my story was too long;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day I give you but a song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old tradition of the North;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, to put you in the mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will a little while prelude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from this instrument draw forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something by way of overture."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He played; at first the tones were pure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tender as a summer night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full moon climbing to her height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sob and ripple of the seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flapping of an idle sail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then by sudden and sharp degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multiplied, wild harmonies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freshened and burst into a gale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tempest howling through the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crash as of some shipwrecked bark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud and melancholy wail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the prelude to the tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told by the Minstrel; and at times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused amid its varying rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at each pause again broke in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of his violin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tones of sweetness or of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Movements of trouble or of calm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating their own atmosphere;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sitting in a church we hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the verses of the psalm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organ playing soft and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thundering on the startled ear.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MUSICIAN'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BALLAD OF CARMILHAN

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Stralsund, by the Baltic Sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the sandy bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sunset of a summer's day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready for sea, at anchor lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good ship Valdemar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunbeams danced upon the waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And played along her side;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the cabin windows streamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ripples of golden light, that seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ripple of the tide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There sat the captain with his friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old skippers brown and hale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who smoked and grumbled o'er their grog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talked of iceberg and of fog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of calm and storm and gale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was spinning a sailor's yarn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Klaboterman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kobold of the sea; a spright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible to mortal sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who o'er the rigging ran.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes he hammered in the hold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes upon the mast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes abeam, sometimes abaft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at the bows he sang and laughed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made all tight and fast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He helped the sailors at their work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toiled with jovial din;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He helped them hoist and reef the sails,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He helped them stow the casks and bales,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heave the anchor in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But woe unto the lazy louts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idlers of the crew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them to torment was his delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And worry them by day and night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pinch them black and blue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And woe to him whose mortal eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaboterman behold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a certain sign of death!--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin-boy here held his breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt his blood run cold.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jolly skipper paused awhile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again began;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a Spectre Ship," quoth he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A ship of the Dead that sails the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is called the Carmilhan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A ghostly ship, with a ghostly crew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tempests she appears;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before the gale, or against the gale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sails without a rag of sail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a helmsman steers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She haunts the Atlantic north and south,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mostly the mid-sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where three great rocks rise bleak and bare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like furnace-chimneys in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are called the Chimneys Three.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And ill betide the luckless ship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That meets the Carmilhan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over her decks the seas will leap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must go down into the deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And perish mouse and man."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed loud with merry heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should like to see this ship," said he;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should like to find these Chimneys Three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That are marked down in the chart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have sailed right over the spot," he said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With a good stiff breeze behind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sea was blue, and the sky was clear,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can follow my course by these pinholes here,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never a rock could find."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he swore a dreadful oath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swore by the Kingdoms Three,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, should he meet the Carmilhan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would run her down, although he ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right into Eternity!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, while passing to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cabin-boy had heard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lingered at the door to hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drank in all with greedy ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pondered every word.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a simple country lad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of a roving mind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, it must be like heaven," thought he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those far-off foreign lands to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fortune seek and find!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the fo'castle, when he heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mariners blaspheme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of home, he thought of God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his mother under the churchyard sod,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wished it were a dream.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One friend on board that ship had he;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the Klaboterman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who saw the Bible in his chest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a sign upon his breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All evil things to ban.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin windows have grown blank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As eyeballs of the dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more the glancing sunbeams burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the gilt letters of the stern,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the figure-head;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Valdemar Victorious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who looketh with disdain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see his image in the tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismembered float from side to side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reunite again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the wind," those skippers said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That swings the vessel so;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the wind; it freshens fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is time to say farewell at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is time for us to go."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shook the captain by the hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodluck! goodluck!" they cried;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each face was like the setting sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, broad and red, they one by one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went o'er the vessel's side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun went down, the full moon rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serene o'er field and flood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the winding creeks and bays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And broad sea-meadows seemed ablaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was red as blood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The southwest wind blew fresh and fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fair as wind could be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound for Odessa, o'er the bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all sail set, the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went proudly out to sea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely moon climbs up the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who walks in dreams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tower of marble in her light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wall of black, a wall of white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stately vessel seems.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low down upon the sandy coast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights begin to burn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, uplifted high in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kindle with a fiercer glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now drop far astern.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn appears, the land is gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is all around;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on each hand low hills of sand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerge and form another land;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She steereth through the Sound.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Kattegat and Skager-rack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flitteth like a ghost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By day and night, by night and day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bounds, she flies upon her way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the English coast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cape Finisterre is drawing near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cape Finisterre is past;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the open ocean stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She floats, the vision of a dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too beautiful to last.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suns rise and set, and rise, and yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no land in sight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquid planets overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burn brighter now the moon is dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And longer stays the night.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now along the horizon's edge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountains of cloud uprose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black as with forests underneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above their sharp and jagged teeth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were white as drifted snows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen behind them sank the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But flushed each snowy peak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while with rosy light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That faded slowly from the sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As blushes from the cheek.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black grew the sky,--all black, all black;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clouds were everywhere;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a feeling of suspense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In nature, a mysterious sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of terror in the air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all on board the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was still as still could be;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save when the dismal ship-bell tolled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever and anon she rolled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lurched into the sea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain up and down the deck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went striding to and fro;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now watched the compass at the wheel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now lifted up his hand to feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which way the wind might blow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he looked up at the sails,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now upon the deep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every fibre of his frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt the storm before it came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had no thought of sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight bells! and suddenly abaft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a great rush of rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the ocean white with spume,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In darkness like the day of doom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On came the hurricane.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning flashed from cloud to cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rent the sky in two;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jagged flame, a single jet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of white fire, like a bayonet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pierced the eyeballs through.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all around was dark again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blacker than before;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in that single flash of light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had beheld a fearful sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought of the oath he swore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For right ahead lay the Ship of the Dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghostly Carmilhan!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her masts were stripped, her yards were bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her bowsprit, poised in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the Klaboterman.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her crew of ghosts was all on deck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or clambering up the shrouds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boatswain's whistle, the captain's hail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were like the piping of the gale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thunder in the clouds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close behind the Carmilhan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There rose up from the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a foundered ship of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three bare and splintered masts alone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were the Chimneys Three.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And onward dashed the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaped into the dark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A denser mist, a colder blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little shudder, and she had passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right through the Phantom Bark.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cleft in twain the shadowy hulk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cleft it unaware;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when, careering to her nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-gull severs with her breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unresisting air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the lightning flashed; again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the Carmilhan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole as before in hull and spar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now on board of the Valdemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the Klaboterman.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they all knew their doom was sealed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew that death was near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some prayed who never prayed before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some they wept, and some they swore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some were mute with fear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly there came a shock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And louder than wind or sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cry burst from the crew on deck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she dashed and crashed, a hopeless wreck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Chimneys Three.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm and night were passed, the light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To streak the east began;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin-boy, picked up at sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survived the wreck, and only he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell of the Carmilhan.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the long murmur of applause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That greeted the Musician's lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had slowly buzzed itself away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the long talk of Spectre Ships
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That followed died upon their lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And came unto a natural pause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These tales you tell are one and all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Old World," the Poet said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flowers gathered from a crumbling wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead leaves that rustle as they fall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me present you in their stead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something of our New England earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale which, though of no great worth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has still this merit, that it yields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain freshness of the fields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweetness as of home-made bread."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student answered: "Be discreet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if the flour be fresh and sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the bread be light and sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who careth in what mill 't was ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of what oven felt the heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, as old Cervantes said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are looking after better bread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any that is made of wheat?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that people nowadays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what is old give little praise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All must be new in prose and verse:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want hot bread, or something worse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh every morning, and half baked;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wholesome bread of yesterday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too stale for them, is thrown away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is their thirst with water slaked.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As oft we see the sky in May
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threaten to rain, and yet not rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet's face, before so gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was clouded with a look of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly brightened up again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And without further let or stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told his tale of yesterday.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE POET'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LADY WENTWORTH.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred years ago, and something more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Queen Street, Portsmouth, at her tavern door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neat as a pin, and blooming as a rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood Mistress Stavers in her furbelows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as her cuckoo-clock was striking nine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above her head, resplendent on the sign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portrait of the Earl of Halifax,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In scarlet coat and periwig of flax,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveyed at leisure all her varied charms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cap, her bodice, her white folded arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half resolved, though he was past his prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rather damaged by the lapse of time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fall down at her feet and to declare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passion that had driven him to despair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For from his lofty station he had seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stavers, her husband, dressed in bottle-green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive his new Flying Stage-coach, four in hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the long lane, and out into the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knew that he was far upon the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Ipswich and to Boston on the Bay!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then the meditations of the Earl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were interrupted by a little girl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barefooted, ragged, with neglected hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes full of laughter, neck and shoulders bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thin slip of a girl, like a new moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure to be rounded into beauty soon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature men would worship and adore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though now in mean habiliments she bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pail of water, dripping, through the street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bathing, as she went her naked feet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pretty picture, full of grace,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender form, the delicate, thin face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swaying motion, as she hurried by;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shining feet, the laughter in her eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That o'er her face in ripples gleamed and glanced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in her pail the shifting sunbeam danced:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with uncommon feelings of delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Halifax beheld the sight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so Dame Stavers, for he heard her say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words, or thought he did, as plain as day:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Martha Hilton!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fie! how dare you go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the town half dressed, and looking so!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which the gypsy laughed, and straight replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter how I look; I yet shall ride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own chariot, ma'am."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Halifax benignly smiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with her heavy burden she passed on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked back, then turned the corner, and was gone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What next, upon that memorable day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrested his attention was a gay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brilliant equipage, that flashed and spun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver harness glittering in the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outriders with red jackets, lithe and lank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pounding the saddles as they rose and sank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all alone within the chariot sat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portly person with three-cornered hat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crimson velvet coat, head high in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold-headed cane, and nicely powdered hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And diamond buckles sparkling at his knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dignified, stately, florid, much at ease.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward the pageant swept, and as it passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Mistress Stavers courtesied low and fast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this was Governor Wentworth, driving down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Little Harbor, just beyond the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where his Great House stood looking out to sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A goodly place, where it was good to be.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasant mansion, an abode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near and yet hidden from the great high-road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sequestered among trees, a noble pile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baronial and colonial in its style;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gables and dormer-windows everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stacks of chimneys rising high in air,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pandaean pipes, on which all winds that blew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made mournful music the whole winter through.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within, unwonted splendors met the eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panels, and floors of oak, and tapestry;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carved chimney-pieces, where on brazen dogs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revelled and roared the Christmas fires of logs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doors opening into darkness unawares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious passages, and flights of stairs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the walls, in heavy gilded frames,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancestral Wentworths with Old-Scripture names.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the mansion where the great man dwelt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A widower and childless; and he felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loneliness, the uncongenial gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like a presence haunted ever room;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For though not given to weakness, he could feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of wounds, that ache because they heal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years came and the years went,--seven in all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed in cloud and sunshine o'er the Hall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawns their splendor through its chambers shed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunsets flushed its western windows red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow was on its roofs, the wind, the rain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its woodlands were in leaf and bare again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moons waxed and waned, the lilacs bloomed and died,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the broad river ebbed and flowed the tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ships went to sea, and ships came home from sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the slow years sailed by and ceased to be.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all these years had Martha Hilton served
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Great House, not wholly unobserved:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By day, by night, the silver crescent grew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though hidden by clouds, her light still shining through;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid of all work, whether coarse or fine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A servant who made service seem divine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through her each room was fair to look upon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirrors glistened, and the brasses shone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very knocker on the outer door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she but passed, was brighter than before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the ceaseless turning of the mill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Time, that never for an hour stands still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ground out the Governor's sixtieth birthday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And powdered his brown hair with silver-gray.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robin, the forerunner of the spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bluebird with his jocund carolling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restless swallows building in the eaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden buttercups, the grass, the leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lilacs tossing in the winds of May,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All welcomed this majestic holiday!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave a splendid banquet served on plate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as became the Governor of the State,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who represented England and the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was magnificent in everything.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had invited all his friends and peers,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pepperels, the Langdons, and the Lears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sparhawks, the Penhallows, and the rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For why repeat the name of every guest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must mention one, in bands and gown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rector there, the Reverend Arthur Brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Established Church; with smiling face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat beside the Governor and said grace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the feast went on, as others do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ended as none other I e'er knew.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they had drunk the King, with many a cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor whispered in a servant's ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who disappeared and presently there stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the room, in perfect womanhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maiden, modest and yet self-possessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youthful and beautiful, and simply dressed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can this be Martha Hilton?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Martha Hilton, and no other she!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dowered with the beauty of her twenty years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How ladylike, how queenlike she appears;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale, thin crescent of the days gone by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Dian now in all her majesty!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet scarce a guest perceived that she was there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Governor, rising from his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played slightly with his ruffles, then looked down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said unto the Reverend Arthur Brown:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my birthday: it shall likewise be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wedding-day; and you shall marry me!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The listening guests were greatly mystified,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None more so than the rector, who replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marry you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that were a pleasant task,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Excellency; but to whom? I ask."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor answered: "To this lady here"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beckoned Martha Hilton to draw near.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came and stood, all blushes, at his side.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rector paused.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impatient Governor cried:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the lady; do you hesitate?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I command you as Chief Magistrate."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rector read the service loud and clear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so on to the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his command
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth finger of her fair left hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor placed the ring; and that was all:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha was Lady Wentworth of the Hall!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well pleased the audience heard the tale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian said: "Indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To praise you there is little need;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One almost hears the farmers flail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thresh out your wheat, nor does there fail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain freshness, as you said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweetness as of home-made bread.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not less sweet and not less fresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are many legends that I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ by the monks of long-ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved to mortify the flesh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the soul might purer grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rise to a diviner state;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of these--perhaps of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most beautiful--I now recall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with permission will narrate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping thereby to make amends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that grim tragedy of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As strong and black as Spanish wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told last night, and wish almost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had remained untold, my friends;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Torquemada's awful ghost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to me in the dreams I dreamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the darkness glared and gleamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a great lighthouse on the coast."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student laughing said: "Far more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to some dismal fire of bale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flaring portentous on a hill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or torches lighted on a shore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By wreckers in a midnight gale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter; be it as you will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only go forward with your tale."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE THEOLOGIAN'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hads't thou stayed, I must have fled!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the Vision said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his chamber all alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneeling on the floor of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayed the Monk in deep contrition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his sins of indecision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayed for greater self-denial
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In temptation and in trial;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was noonday by the dial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Monk was all alone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, as if it lightened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unwonted splendor brightened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All within him and without him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that narrow cell of stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he saw the Blessed Vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our Lord, with light Elysian
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a vesture wrapped about him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a garment round him thrown.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as crucified and slain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in agonies of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not with bleeding hands and feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Monk his Master see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as in the village street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the house or harvest-field,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halt and lame and blind he healed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked in Galilee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attitude imploring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands upon his bosom crossed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondering, worshipping, adoring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt the Monk in rapture lost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am I, that thus thou deignest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reveal thyself to me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am I, that from the centre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy glory thou shouldst enter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poor cell, my guest to be?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then amid his exaltation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud the convent bell appalling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its belfry calling, calling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang through court and corridor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With persistent iteration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had never heard before.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was now the appointed hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When alike in shine or shower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter's cold or summer's heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the convent portals came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the blind and halt and lame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the beggars of the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For their daily dole of food
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealt them by the brotherhood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their almoner was he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who upon his bended knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapt in silent ecstasy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of divinest self-surrender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the Vision and the Splendor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep distress and hesitation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled with his adoration;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he go, or should he stay?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he leave the poor to wait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry at the convent gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the Vision passed away?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he slight his radiant guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slight this visitant celestial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a crowd of ragged, bestial
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggars at the convent gate?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Vision there remain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Vision come again?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a voice within his breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered, audible and clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to the outward ear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do thy duty; that is best;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave unto thy Lord the rest!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway to his feet he started,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with longing look intent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Blessed Vision bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly from his cell departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly on his errand went.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gate the poor were waiting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking through the iron grating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that terror in the eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is only seen in those
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who amid their wants and woes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the sound of doors that close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of feet that pass them by;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown familiar with disfavor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown familiar with the savor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bread by which men die!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to-day, they knew not why,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the gate of Paradise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed the convent sate to rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sacrament divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to them the bread and wine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart the Monk was praying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the homeless poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they suffer and endure;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we see not, what we see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the inward voice was saying:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whatsoever thing thou doest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the least of mine and lowest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou doest unto me!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto me! but had the Vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to him in beggar's clothing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come a mendicant imploring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he then have knelt adoring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or have listened with derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have turned away with loathing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus his conscience put the question,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of troublesome suggestion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at length, with hurried pace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards his cell he turned his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beheld the convent bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a supernatural light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a luminous cloud expanding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over floor and wall and ceiling.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he paused with awe-struck feeling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the threshold of his door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Vision still was standing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he left it there before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the convent bell appalling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its belfry calling, calling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned him to feed the poor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the long hour intervening
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had waited his return,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he felt his bosom burn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehending all the meaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Blessed Vision said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled!"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All praised the Legend more or less;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some liked the moral, some the verse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some thought it better, and some worse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than other legends of the past;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until, with ill-concealed distress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all their cavilling, at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian gravely said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Spanish proverb, then, is right;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consult your friends on what you do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one will say that it is white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And others say that it is red."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Amen!" quoth the Spanish Jew.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six stories told!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have seven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cluster like the Pleiades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! it happens, as with these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That one is missing from our heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the Landlord?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring him here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Lost Pleiad reappear."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Sicilian cried, and went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith to seek his missing star,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But did not find him in the bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place that landlords most frequent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet beside the kitchen fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor up the stairs, nor in the hall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in vain to ask or call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no tidings of the Squire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he came back with downcast head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclaiming: "Well, our bashful host
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath surely given up the ghost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another proverb says the dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can tell no tales; and that is true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows, then, that one of you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must tell a story in his stead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must," he to the Student said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who know so many of the best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell them better than the rest."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight by these flattering words beguiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student, happy as a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he is called a little man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumed the double task imposed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And without more ado unclosed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His smiling lips, and thus began.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE STUDENT'S SECOND TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron Castine of St. Castine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has left his chateau in the Pyrenees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sailed across the western seas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went away from his fair demesne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds were building, the woods were green;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the winds of winter blow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the turrets of the old chateau,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds are silent and unseen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves lie dead in the ravine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Pyrenees are white with snow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father, lonely, old, and gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sits by the fireside day by day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking ever one thought of care;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the southern windows, narrow and tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines into the ancient hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes a glory round his hair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house-dog, stretched beneath his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groans in his sleep as if in pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then wakes, and yawns, and sleeps again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So silent is it everywhere,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So silent you can hear the mouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run and rummage along the beams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the wainscot of the wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old man rouses from his dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wanders restless through the house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he heard strange voices call.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His footsteps echo along the floor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a distant passage, and pause awhile;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing by an open door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking long, with a sad, sweet smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room of his absent son.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the bed on which he lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the pictures bright and gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horses and hounds and sun-lit seas;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are his powder-flask and gun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his hunting-knives in shape of a fan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair by the window where he sat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the clouded tiger-skin for a mat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out on the Pyrenees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out on Mount Marbore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Seven Valleys of Lavedan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! he turns away and sighs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mist before his eyes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night whatever the weather be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind or rain or starry heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the clock is striking seven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who look from the windows see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village Curate, with lantern and maid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come through the gateway from the park
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cross the courtyard damp and dark,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of light in a ring of shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now at the old man's side he stands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is cheery, his heart expands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gossips pleasantly, by the blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fire of fagots, about old days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cardinal Mazarin and the Fronde,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Cardinal's nieces fair and fond,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what they did, and what they said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they heard his Eminence was dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after a pause the old man says,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind still coming back again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the one sad thought that haunts his brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are there any tidings from over sea?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, why has that wild boy gone from me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Curate answers, looking down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless and docile as a lamb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young blood! young blood!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must so be!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And draws from the pocket of his gown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A handkerchief like an oriflamb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wipes his spectacles, and they play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their little game of lansquenet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence for an hour or so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the clock at nine strikes loud and clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the village lying asleep below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And across the courtyard, into the dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the winding pathway in the park,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curate and lantern disappear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And darkness reigns in the old chateau.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship has come back from over sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been signalled from below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into the harbor of Bordeaux
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sails with her gallant company.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But among them is nowhere seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brave young Baron of St. Castine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath tarried behind, I ween,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beautiful land of Acadie!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the father paces to and fro
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the chambers of the old chateau,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting, waiting to hear the hum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wheels on the road that runs below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of servants hurrying here and there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice in the courtyard, the step on the stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for some one who doth not come!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But letters there are, which the old man reads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Curate, when he comes at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Word by word, as an acolyte
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeats his prayers and tells his beads;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letters full of the rolling sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of a young man's joy to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abroad in the world, alone and free;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of adventures and wonderful scenes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hunting the deer through forests vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the royal grant of Pierre du Gast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nights in the tents of the Tarratines;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Madocawando the Indian chief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his daughters, glorious as queens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beautiful beyond belief;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so soft the tones of their native tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words are not spoken, they are sung!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Curate listens, and smiling says:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah yes, dear friend! in our young days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have liked to hunt the deer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day amid those forest scenes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to sleep in the tents of the Tarratines;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it is better sitting here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within four walls, and without the fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of losing our hearts to Indian queens;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For man is fire and woman is tow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Somebody comes and begins to blow."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a gleam of distrust and vague surmise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines in the father's gentle eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fire-light on a window-pane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glimmers and vanishes again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But naught he answers; he only sighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for a moment bows his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as their custom is, they play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their little gain of lansquenet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another day is with the dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another day, and many a day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a week and month depart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a fatal letter wings its way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the sea, like a bird of prey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strikes and tears the old man's heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the young Baron of St. Castine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift as the wind is, and as wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has married a dusky Tarratine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has married Madocawando's child!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter drops from the father's hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the sinews of his heart are wrung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He utters no cry, he breathes no prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No malediction falls from his tongue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his stately figure, erect and grand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bends and sinks like a column of sand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whirlwind of his great despair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying, yes, dying!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His latest breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of parley at the door of death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a blessing on his wayward son.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower and lower on his breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinks his gray head; he is at rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer he waits for any one;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many a year the old chateau
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies tenantless and desolate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rank grasses in the courtyard grow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About its gables caws the crow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the porter at the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is left to guard it, and to wait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming of the rightful heir;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other life or sound is there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more the Curate comes at night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more is seen the unsteady light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threading the alleys of the park;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows of the hall are dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chambers dreary, cold, and bare!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length, at last, when the winter is past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And birds are building, and woods are green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flying skirts is the Curate seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speeding along the woodland way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humming gayly, "No day is so long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it comes at last to vesper-song."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stops at the porter's lodge to say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at last the Baron of St. Castine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is coming home with his Indian queen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is coming without a week's delay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the house must be swept and clean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all things set in good array!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the solemn porter shakes his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the answer he makes is: "Lackaday!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will see, as the blind man said!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alert since first the day began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cock upon the village church
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks northward from his airy perch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if beyond the ken of man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the ships come sailing on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pass the isle of Oleron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pass the Tower of Cordouan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church below is cold in clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart that would have leaped for joy--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O tender heart of truth and trust!--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the coming of that day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church below the lips are dust;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust are the hands, and dust the feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would have been so swift to meet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming of that wayward boy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night the front of the old chateau
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a blaze of light above and below;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a sound of wheels and hoofs in the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cracking of whips, and scamper of feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bells are ringing, and horns are blown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Baron hath come again to his own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Curate is waiting in the hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most eager and alive of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To welcome the Baron and Baroness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his mind is full of vague distress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he hath read in Jesuit books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those children of the wilderness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, good, simple man! he looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see a painted savage stride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the room, with shoulders bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eagle feathers in her hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around her a robe of panther's hide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, he beholds with secret shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A form of beauty undefined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loveliness with out a name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not of degree, but more of kind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor bold nor shy, nor short nor tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a new mingling of them all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, beautiful beyond belief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfigured and transfused, he sees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady of the Pyrenees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter of the Indian chief.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the shadow of her hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold-bronze color of the skin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems lighted by a fire within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when a burst of sunlight shines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a sombre grove of pines,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dusky splendor in the air.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two small hands, that now are pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his, seem made to be caressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They lie so warm and soft and still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like birds half hidden in a nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trustful, and innocent of ill.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ah! he cannot believe his ears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When her melodious voice he hears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking his native Gascon tongue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words she utters seem to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of some poem of Goudouli,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not spoken, they are sung!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Baron smiles, and says, "You see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told you but the simple truth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, you may trust the eyes of youth!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in the village day by day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people gossip in their way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stare to see the Baroness pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday morning to early Mass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when she kneeleth down to pray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wonder, and whisper together, and say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely this is no heathen lass!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in course of time they learn to bless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron and the Baroness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in course of time the Curate learns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secret so dreadful, that by turns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ice and fire, he freezes and burns.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron at confession hath said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That though this woman be his wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bath wed her as the Indians wed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath bought her for a gun and a knife!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Curate replies: "O profligate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Prodigal Son! return once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the open arms and the open door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Church, or ever it be too late.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God, thy father did not live
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see what he could not forgive;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thee, so reckless and perverse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left his blessing, not his curse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nearer the dawn the darker the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by going wrong all things come right;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have been mended that were worse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the worse, the nearer they are to mend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of the living and the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt be wed as Christians wed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all things come to a happy end."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sun, that followest the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yon blue sky, serene and pure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pourest thine impartial light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike on mountain and on moor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause for a moment in thy course,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bless the bridegroom and the bride!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Gave, that from thy hidden source
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In you mysterious mountain-side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuest thy wandering way alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaping down its steps of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the meadow-lands demure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stealest away to the Adour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause for a moment in thy course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bless the bridegroom and the bride!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choir is singing the matin song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors of the church are opened wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people crowd, and press, and throng
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the bridegroom and the bride.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They enter and pass along the nave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stand upon the father's grave;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells are ringing soft and slow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living above and the dead below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give their blessing on one and twain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm wind blows from the hills of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds are building, the leaves are green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Baron Castine of St. Castine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath come at last to his own again.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FINALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nunc plaudite!" the Student cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had finished; "now applaud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Roman actors used to say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of a play";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rose, and spread his hands abroad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiling bowed from side to side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who bears the palm away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And generous was the applause and loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But less for him than for the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That even as the tale was done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst from its canopy of cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lit the landscape with the blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of afternoon on autumn days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled the room with light, and made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of logs a painted shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden wind from out the west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew all its trumpets loud and shrill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows rattled with the blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oak-trees shouted as it passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight, as if by fear possessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud encampment on the hill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke up, and fluttering flag and tent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished into the firmament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the valley fled amain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear of the retreating rain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only far up in the blue sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mass of clouds, like drifted snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffused with a faint Alpine glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heaped together, vast and high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which a shattered rainbow hung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not rising like the ruined arch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some aerial aqueduct,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like a roseate garland plucked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an Olympian god, and flung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside in his triumphal march.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like prisoners from their dungeon gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like birds escaping from a snare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like school-boys at the hour of play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All left at once the pent-up room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rushed into the open air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no more tales were told that day.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PART THIRD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRELUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening came; the golden vane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment in the sunset glanced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then darkened, and then gleamed again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the east the moon advanced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touched it with a softer light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While underneath, with flowing mane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the sign the Red Horse pranced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And galloped forth into the night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But brighter than the afternoon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That followed the dark day of rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brighter than the golden vane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That glistened in the rising moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the ruddy fire-light gleamed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every separate window-pane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backed by the outer darkness, showed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mirror, where the flamelets gleamed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flickered to and fro, and seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bonfire lighted in the road.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the hospitable glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an old actor on the stage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the uncertain voice of age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singing chimney chanted low
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homely songs of long ago.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice that Ossian heard of yore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When midnight winds were in his hall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ghostly and appealing call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound of days that are no more!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dark as Ossian sat the Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listened to the sound, and knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of the airy hosts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray and misty cloud of ghosts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their interminable flight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listening muttered in his beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With accent indistinct and weird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are ye, children of the Night?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beholding his mysterious face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me," the gay Sicilian said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why was it that in breaking bread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At supper, you bent down your head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, musing, paused a little space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who says a silent grace?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jew replied, with solemn air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said the Manichaean's prayer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was his faith,--perhaps is mine,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That life in all its forms is one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that its secret conduits run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen, but in unbroken line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the great fountain-head divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through man and beast, through grain and grass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe'er we struggle, strive, and cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From death there can be no escape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no escape from life, alas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we cannot die, but pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From one into another shape:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is but into life we die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore the Manichaean said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple prayer on breaking bread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest he with hasty hand or knife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might wound the incarcerated life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul in things that we call dead:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I did not reap thee, did not bind thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not thrash thee, did not grind thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did I in the oven bake thee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not I, it was another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did these things unto thee, O brother;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have thee, hold thee, break thee!'"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That birds have souls I can concede,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet cried, with glowing cheeks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flocks that from their beds of reed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprising north or southward fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flying write upon the sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biforked letter of the Greeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hath been said by Rucellai;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All birds that sing or chirp or cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those migratory bands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minor poets of the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plover, peep, and sanderling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hardly can be said to sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But pipe along the barren sands,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these have souls akin to ours;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So hath the lovely race of flowers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus much I grant, but nothing more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rusty hinges of a door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not alive because they creak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chimney, with its dreary roar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rattling windows, do not speak!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To me they speak," the Jew replied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the sounds that sink and soar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the voices of a tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That breaks upon an unknown shore!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the Sicilian interfered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was your dream, then, as you dozed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment since, with eyes half-closed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmured something in your beard."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hebrew smiled, and answered, "Nay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that, but something very near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, and yet not the same, may seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of my waking dream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it wholly dies away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to me, and you shall hear."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SPANISH JEW'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AZRAEL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Solomon, before his palace gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At evening, on the pavement tessellate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was walking with a stranger from the East,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrayed in rich attire as for a feast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty Runjeet-Sing, a learned man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rajah of the realms of Hindostan.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they walked the guest became aware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a white figure in the twilight air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing intent, as one who with surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His form and features seemed to recognize;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a whisper to the king he said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is yon shape, that, pallid as the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is watching me, as if he sought to trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim light the features of my face?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king looked, and replied: "I know him well;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Angel men call Azrael,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is the Death Angel; what hast thou to fear?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the guest answered: "Lest he should come near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speak to me, and take away my breath!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save me from Azrael, save me from death!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O king, that hast dominion o'er the wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bid it arise and bear me hence to Ind."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king gazed upward at the cloudless sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered a word, and raised his hand on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! the signet-ring of chrysoprase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his uplifted finger seemed to blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hidden fire, and rushing from the west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came a mighty wind, and seized the guest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lifted him from earth, and on they passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shining garments streaming in the blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silken banner o'er the walls upreared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purple cloud, that gleamed and disappeared.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the Angel, smiling: "If this man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be Rajah Runjeet-Sing of Hindostan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast done well in listening to his prayer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was upon my way to seek him there."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Edrehi, forbear to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ghostly legends of affright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the Talmud rest in peace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spare us your dismal tales of death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That almost take away one's breath;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So doing, may your tribe increase."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Sicilian said; then went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the spinet's rattling keys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played Marianina, like a breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Naples and the Southern seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings us the delicious scent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of citron and of orange trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And memories of soft days of ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Capri and Amalfi spent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so," the eager Poet said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least, not so before I tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of my Azrael,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel mortal as ourselves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which in an ancient tome I found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a convent's dusty shelves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chained with an iron chain, and bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parchment, and with clasps of brass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest from its prison, some dark day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be stolen or steal away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the good friars were singing mass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a tale of Charlemagne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When like a thunder-cloud, that lowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweeps from mountain-crest to coast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lightning flaming through its showers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swept across the Lombard plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beleaguering with his warlike train
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pavia, the country's pride and boast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of the Hundred Towers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus heralded the tale began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus in sober measure ran.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE POET'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHARLEMAGNE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olger the Dane and Desiderio,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King of the Lombards, on a lofty tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood gazing northward o'er the rolling plains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;League after league of harvests, to the foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the snow-crested Alps, and saw approach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mighty army, thronging all the roads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That led into the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said unto Olger, who had passed his youth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hostage at the court of France, and knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor's form and face "Is Charlemagne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among that host?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Olger answered: "No."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still the innumerable multitude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowed onward and increased, until the King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried in amazement: "Surely Charlemagne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is coming in the midst of all these knights!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Olger answered slowly: "No; not yet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not come so soon."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then much disturbed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Desiderio asked: "What shall we do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if he approach with a still greater army!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Olger answered: "When he shall appear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will behold what manner of man he is;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what will then befall us I know not."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the guard that never knew repose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladins of France; and at the sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lombard King o'ercome with terror cried:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This must be Charlemagne!" and as before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Olger answer: "No; not yet, not yet."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then appeared in panoply complete
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishops and the Abbots and the Priests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the imperial chapel, and the Counts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Desiderio could no more endure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of day, nor yet encounter death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sobbed aloud and said: "Let us go down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hide us in the bosom of the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the sight and anger of a foe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So terrible as this!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Olger said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you behold the harvests in the fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking with fear, the Po and the Ticino
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lashing the city walls with iron waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then may you know that Charlemagne is come.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even as he spake, in the northwest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! there uprose a black and threatening cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of whose bosom flashed the light of arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the people pent up in the city;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light more terrible than any darkness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Charlemagne appeared;--a Man of Iron!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His helmet was of iron, and his gloves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of iron, and his breastplate and his greaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tassets were of iron, and his shield.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his left hand he held an iron spear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his right hand his sword invincible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse he rode on had the strength of iron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And color of iron.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All who went before him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him and behind him, his whole host,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were armed with iron, and their hearts within them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were stronger than the armor that they wore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields and all the roads were filled with iron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And points of iron glistened in the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shed a terror through the city streets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This at a single glance Olger the Dane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw from the tower, and turning to the King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclaimed in haste: "Behold! this is the man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You looked for with such eagerness!" and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell as one dead at Desiderio's feet.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well pleased all listened to the tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drew, the Student said, its pith
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And marrow from the ancient myth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some one with an iron flail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that portentous Man of Brass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hephaestus made in days of yore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stalked about the Cretan shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the ships appear and pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threw stones at the Argonauts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being filled with indiscriminate ire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tangled and perplexed his thoughts;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, like a hospitable host,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When strangers landed on the coast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heated himself red-hot with fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hugged them in his arms, and pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bodies to his burning breast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet answered: "No, not thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend rose; it sprang at first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the hunger and the thirst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all men for the marvellous.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus it filled and satisfied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imagination of mankind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this ideal to the mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was truer than historic fact.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy enlarged and multiplied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenors of the awful name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Charlemagne, till he became
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armipotent in every act,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, clothed in mystery, appeared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not what men saw, but what they feared.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, unless my memory fail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your some one with an iron flail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not an ancient myth at all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But comes much later on the scene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Talus in the Faerie Queene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron groom of Artegall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who threshed out falsehood and deceit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And truth upheld, and righted wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was, as is the swallow, fleet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the lion is, was strong."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian said: "Perchance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your chronicler in writing this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had in his mind the Anabasis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Xenophon describes the advance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Artaxerxes to the fight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first the low gray cloud of dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a blackness o'er the fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of a passing thunder-gust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then flash of brazen armor bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ranks of men, and spears up-thrust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowmen and troops with wicker shields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cavalry equipped in white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chariots ranged in front of these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With scythes upon their axle-trees."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this the Student answered: "Well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have a tale to tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Charlemagne; a tale that throws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A softer light, more tinged with rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than your grim apparition cast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the darkness of the past.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, and hear in English rhyme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the good Monk of Lauresheim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives as the gossip of his time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mediaeval Latin prose."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE STUDENT'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMMA AND EGINHARD

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Alcuin taught the sons of Charlemagne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the free schools of Aix, how kings should reign,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with them taught the children of the poor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How subjects should be patient and endure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the lips of some, as best befit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With honey from the hives of Holy Writ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others intoxicated with the wine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ancient history, sweet but less divine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some with the wholesome fruits of grammar fed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others with mysteries of the stars o'er-head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hang suspended in the vaulted sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like lamps in some fair palace vast and high.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sooth, it was a pleasant sight to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Saxon monk, with hood and rosary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With inkhorn at his belt, and pen and book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mingled lore and reverence in his look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hear the cloister and the court repeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measured footfalls of his sandaled feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or watch him with the pupils of his school,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle of speech, but absolute of rule.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them, always earliest in his place.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Eginhard, a youth of Frankish race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose face was bright with flashes that forerun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendors of a yet unrisen sun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him all things were possible, and seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not what he had accomplished, but had dreamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what were tasks to others were his play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastime of an idle holiday.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smaragdo, Abbot of St. Michael's, said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a shrug and shaking of the head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely some demon must possess the lad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who showed more wit than ever schoolboy had,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learned his Trivium thus without the rod;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Alcuin said it was the grace of God.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he grew up, in Logic point-device,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect in Grammar, and in Rhetoric nice;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science of Numbers, Geometric art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lore of Stars, and Music knew by heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Minnesinger, long before the times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who sang their love in Suabian rhymes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor, when he heard this good report
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Eginhard much buzzed about the court,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said to himself, "This stripling seems to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purposely sent into the world for me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall become my scribe, and shall be schooled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the arts whereby the world is ruled."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did the gentle Eginhard attain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To honor in the court of Charlemagne;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Became the sovereign's favorite, his right hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that his fame was great in all the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all men loved him for his modest grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And comeliness of figure and of face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inmate of the palace, yet recluse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of books, yet sacred from abuse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the armed knights with spur on heel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tramp of horses and the clang of steel;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the Emperor promised he was schooled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the arts by which the world is ruled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the one art supreme, whose law is fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor never dreamed of till too late.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home from her convent to the palace came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely Princess Emma, whose sweet name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered by seneschal or sung by bard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had often touched the soul of Eginhard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw her from his window, as in state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came, by knights attended through the gate;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw her at the banquet of that day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh as the morn, and beautiful as May;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw her in the garden, as she strayed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the flowers of summer with her maid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said to him, "O Eginhard, disclose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning and the mystery of the rose";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trembling he made answer: "In good sooth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mystery is love, its meaning youth!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I tell the signals and the signs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By which one heart another heart divines?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I tell the many thousand ways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By which it keeps the secret it betrays?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O mystery of love!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O strange romance!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the Peers and Paladins of France,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining in steel, and prancing on gay steeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble by birth, yet nobler by great deeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess Emma had no words nor looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this clerk, this man of thought and books.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer passed, the autumn came; the stalks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lilies blackened in the garden walks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves fell, russet-golden and blood-red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love-letters thought the poet fancy-led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Jove descending in a shower of gold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the lap of Danae of old;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For poets cherish many a strange conceit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love transmutes all nature by its heat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more the garden lessons, nor the dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurried meetings in the twilight park;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the studious lamp, and the delights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of firesides in the silent winter nights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watching from his window hour by hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light that burned in Princess Emma's tower.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length one night, while musing by the fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ercome at last by his insane desire,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what will reckless love not do and dare?--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crossed the court, and climbed the winding stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some feigned message in the Emperor's name;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he to the lady's presence came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knelt down at her feet, until she laid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hand upon him, like a naked blade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispered in his ear: "Arise, Sir Knight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my heart's level, O my heart's delight."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there he lingered till the crowing cock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alectryon of the farmyard and the flock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his aubade with lusty voice and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the sleeping world that dawn was near.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they parted; but at parting, lo!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the palace courtyard white with snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, placid as a nun, the moon on high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing from cloudy cloisters of the sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas!" he said, "how hide the fatal line
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of footprints leading from thy door to mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none returning!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, he little knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What woman's wit, when put to proof, can do!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night the Emperor, sleepless with the cares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And troubles that attend on state affairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had risen before the dawn, and musing gazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the silent night, as one amazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the calm that reigned o'er all supreme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his own reign was but a troubled dream.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon lit up the gables capped with snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the white roofs, and half the court below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he beheld a form, that seemed to cower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a burden, come from Emma's tower,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman, who upon her shoulders bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clerk Eginhard to his own private door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then returned in haste, but still essayed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tread the footprints she herself had made;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as she passed across the lighted space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor saw his daughter Emma's face!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started not; he did not speak or moan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seemed as one who hath been turned to stone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood there like a statue, nor awoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of his trance of pain, till morning broke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the stars faded, and the moon went down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er the towers and steeples of the town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the gray daylight; then the sun, who took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire of the world with sovereign look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffusing with a soft and golden glow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dead landscape in its shroud of snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching with flame the tapering chapel spires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows and roofs, and smoke of household fires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kindling park and palace as he came;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stork's nest on the chimney seemed in flame.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus he stood till Eginhard appeared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demure and modest with his comely beard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowing flaxen tresses, come to ask,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was his wont, the day's appointed task.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor looked upon him with a smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gently said: "My son, wait yet awhile;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hour my council meets upon some great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very urgent business of the state.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come back within the hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thy return
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work appointed for thee shalt thou learn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dismissed this gallant Troubadour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He summoned straight his council, and secure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And steadfast in his purpose, from the throne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the adventure of the night made known;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then asked for sentence; and with eager breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some answered banishment, and others death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake the king: "Your sentence is not mine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is the gift of God, and is divine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor from these palace walls shall one depart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who carries such a secret in his heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My better judgment points another way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Alcuin, I remember how one day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my Pepino asked you, 'What are men?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wrote upon his tablets with your pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Guests of the grave and travellers that pass!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being true of all men, we, alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being all fashioned of the selfsame dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be merciful as well as just;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passing traveller, who hath stolen away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brightest jewel of my crown to-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall of himself the precious gem restore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By giving it, I make it mine once more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over those fatal footprints I will throw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ermine mantle like another snow."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Eginhard was summoned to the hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And entered, and in presence of them all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor said: "My son, for thou to me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast been a son, and evermore shalt be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long hast thou served thy sovereign, and thy zeal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleads to me with importunate appeal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have been forgetful to requite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy service and affection as was right.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the hour is come, when I, thy Lord,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will crown thy love with such supreme reward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gift so precious kings have striven in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win it from the hands of Charlemagne."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sprang the portals of the chamber wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Princess Emma entered, in the pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of birth and beauty, that in part o'er-came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conscious terror and the blush of shame.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good Emperor rose up from his throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taking her white hand within his own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placed it in Eginhard's, and said: "My son
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the gift thy constant zeal hath won;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I repay the royal debt I owe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cover up the footprints in the snow."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ran the Student's pleasant rhyme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Eginhard and love and youth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some doubted its historic truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while they doubted, ne'ertheless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw in it gleams of truthfulness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thanked the Monk of Lauresheim.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This they discussed in various mood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the silence that ensued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heard a sharp and sudden sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of a bowstring snapped in air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Musician with a bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang up in terror from his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for a moment listening stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then strode across the room, and found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dear, his darling violin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still lying safe asleep within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its little cradle, like a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gives a sudden cry of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wakes to fall asleep again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he looked at it and smiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the uncertain light beguiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despair! two strings were broken in twain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all lamented and made moan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a sympathetic word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the loss had been their own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeming the tones they might have heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter than they had heard before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the Landlord at the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missing man, the portly Squire!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had not entered, but he stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both arms full of seasoned wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed the much-devouring fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like a lion in a cage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lashed its long tail and roared with rage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missing man!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, yes, they said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing, but whither had he fled?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where had he hidden himself away?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No farther than the barn or shed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had not hidden himself, nor fled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should he pass the rainy day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in his barn with hens and hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or mending harness, cart, or sled?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, having come, he needs must stay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell his tale as well as they.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord answered only: "These
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are logs from the dead apple-trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the old orchard planted here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the first Howe of Sudbury.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor oak nor maple has so clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flame, or burns so quietly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or leaves an ash so clean and white";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking by this to put aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impending tale that terrified;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When suddenly, to his delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian interposed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying that when the door was closed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they had stopped that draft of cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpleasant night air, he proposed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell a tale world-wide apart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that the Student had just told;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World-wide apart, and yet akin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As showing that the human heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beats on forever as of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well beneath the snow-white fold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Quaker kerchief, as within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sendal or silk or cloth of gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And without preface would begin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the clamorous clock struck eight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberate, with sonorous chime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow measuring out the march of time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some grave Consul of old Rome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jupiter's temple driving home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nails that marked the year and date.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus interrupted in his rhyme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian needs must wait;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But quoted Horace, where he sings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dire Necessity of things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drives into the roofs sublime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of new-built houses of the great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adamantine nails of Fate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ceased the little carillon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To herald from its wooden tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important transit of the hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian hastened on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content to be all owed at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sing his Idyl of the Past.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE THEOLOGIAN'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIZABETH

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, how short are the days!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How soon the night overtakes us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old country the twilight is longer; but here in the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly comes the dark, with hardly a pause in its coming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly a moment between the two lights, the day and the lamplight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet how grand is the winter!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How spotless the snow is, and perfect!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus spake Elizabeth Haddon at nightfall to Hannah the housemaid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the farm-house kitchen, that served for kitchen and parlor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the window she sat with her work, and looked on a landscape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White as the great white sheet that Peter saw in his vision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the four corners let down and descending out of the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered with snow were the forests of pine, and the fields and the meadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing was dark but the sky, and the distant Delaware flowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from its native hills, a peaceful and bountiful river.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a smile on her lips made answer Hannah the housemaid:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful winter! yea, the winter is beautiful, surely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one could only walk like a fly with one's feet on the ceiling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the great Delaware River is not like the Thames, as we saw it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of our upper windows in Rotherhithe Street in the Borough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowded with masts and sails of vessels coming and going;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here there is nothing but pines, with patches of snow on their branches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is snow in the air, and see! it is falling already;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the roads will be blocked, and I pity Joseph to-morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking his way through the drifts, with his sled and oxen; and then, too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How in all the world shall we get to Meeting on First-Day?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Elizabeth checked her, and answered, mildly reproving:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely the Lord will provide; for unto the snow he sayeth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be thou on the earth, the good Lord sayeth; he is it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giveth snow like wool, like ashes scatters the hoar-frost."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she folded her work and laid it away in her basket.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Hannah the housemaid had closed and fastened the shutters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the cloth, and lighted the lamp on the table, and placed there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plates and cups from the dresser, the brown rye loaf, and the butter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh from the dairy, and then, protecting her hand with a holder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took from the crane in the chimney the steaming and simmering kettle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poised it aloft in the air, and filled up the earthen teapot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made in Delft, and adorned with quaint and wonderful figures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elizabeth said, "Lo! Joseph is long on his errand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sent him away with a hamper of food and of clothing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the poor in the village.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good lad and cheerful is Joseph;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the right place is his heart, and his hand is ready and willing."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus in praise of her servant she spake, and Hannah the housemaid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed with her eyes, as she listened, but governed her tongue, and was silent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While her mistress went on: "The house is far from the village;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be lonely here, were it not for Friends that in passing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes tarry o'ernight, and make us glad by their coming."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon answered Hannah the housemaid, the thrifty, the frugal:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, they come and they tarry, as if thy house were a tavern;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open to all are its doors, and they come and go like the pigeons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out of the holes of the pigeon-house over the hayloft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooing and smoothing their feathers and basking themselves in the sunshine."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in meekness of spirit, and calmly, Elizabeth answered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All I have is the Lord's, not mine to give or withhold it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I but distribute his gifts to the poor, and to those of his people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in journeyings often surrender their lives to his service.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His, not mine, are the gifts, and only so far can I make them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine, as in giving I add my heart to whatever is given.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore my excellent father first built this house in the clearing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he came not himself, I came; for the Lord was my guidance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading me here for this service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not grudge, then, to others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever the cup of cold water, or crumbs that fall from our table."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus rebuked, for a season was silent the penitent housemaid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Elizabeth said in tones even sweeter and softer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dost thou remember, Hannah, the great May-Meeting in London,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was still a child, how we sat in the silent assembly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting upon the Lord in patient and passive submission?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one spake, till at length a young man, a stranger, John Estaugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved by the Spirit, rose, as if he were John the Apostle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking such words of power that they bowed our hearts, as a strong wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bends the grass of the fields, or grain that is ripe for the sickle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts of him to-day have been oft borne inward upon me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore I do not know; but strong is the feeling within me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That once more I shall see a face I have never forgotten."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en as she spake they heard the musical jangle of sleigh-bells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First far off, with a dreamy sound and faint in the distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then growing nearer and louder, and turning into the farmyard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it stopped at the door, with sudden creaking of runners.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were voices heard as of two men talking together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to herself, as she listened, upbraiding said Hannah the housemaid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Joseph come back, and I wonder what stranger is with him?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from its nail she took and lighted the great tin lantern
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierced with holes, and round, and roofed like the top of a lighthouse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went forth to receive the coming guest at the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casting into the dark a network of glimmer and shadow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the falling snow, the yellow sleigh, and the horses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the forms of men, snow-covered, looming gigantic.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then giving Joseph the lantern, she entered the house with the stranger.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youthful he was and tall, and his cheeks aglow with the night air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he entered, Elizabeth rose, and, going to meet him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if an unseen power had announced and preceded his presence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he had come as one whose coming had long been expected,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly gave him her hand, and said, "Thou art welcome, John Estaugh."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stranger replied, with staid and quiet behavior,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dost thou remember me still, Elizabeth?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so many
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years have passed, it seemeth a wonderful thing that I find thee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the hand of the Lord conducted me here to thy threshold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as I journeyed along, and pondered alone and in silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his ways, that are past finding out, I saw in the snow-mist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemingly weary with travel, a wayfarer, who by the wayside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused and waited.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith I remembered Queen Candace's eunuch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How on the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading Esaias the Prophet, he journeyed, and spake unto Philip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praying him to come up and sit in his chariot with him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I greeted the man, and he mounted the sledge beside me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as we talked on the way he told me of thee and thy homestead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, being led by the light of the Spirit, that never deceiveth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of zeal for the work of the Lord, thou hadst come to this country.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I remembered thy name, and thy father and mother in England,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on my journey have stopped to see thee, Elizabeth Haddon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wishing to strengthen thy hand in the labors of love thou art doing."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Elizabeth answered with confident voice, and serenely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking into his face with her innocent eyes as she answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely the hand of the Lord is in it; his Spirit hath led thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the darkness and storm to the light and peace of my fireside."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with stamping of feet, the door was opened, and Joseph
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered, bearing the lantern, and, carefully blowing the light out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rung it up on its nail, and all sat down to their supper;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For underneath that roof was no distinction of persons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one family only, one heart, one hearth and one household.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the supper was ended they drew their chairs to the fireplace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spacious, open-hearted, profuse of flame and of firewood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of forests unfelled, and not a gleaner of fagots,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading its arms to embrace with inexhaustible bounty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All who fled from the cold, exultant, laughing at winter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Hannah the housemaid was busy in clearing the table,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming and going, and hustling about in closet and chamber.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elizabeth told her story again to John Estaugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going far back to the past, to the early days of her childhood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How she had waited and watched, in all her doubts and besetments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comforted with the extendings and holy, sweet inflowings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the spirit of love, till the voice imperative sounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she obeyed the voice, and cast in her lot with her people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in the desert land, and God would provide for the issue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Joseph sat with folded hands, and demurely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened, or seemed to listen, and in the silence that followed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing was heard for a while but the step of Hannah the housemaid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking the floor overhead, and setting the chambers in order.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Elizabeth said, with a smile of compassion, "The maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath a light heart in her breast, but her feet are heavy and awkward."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inwardly Joseph laughed, but governed his tongue, and was silent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the hour of sleep, death's counterfeit, nightly rehearsal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the great Silent Assembly, the Meeting of shadows, where no man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaketh, but all are still, and the peace and rest are unbroken!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently over that house the blessing of slumber descended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the morning dawned, and the sun uprose in his splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking his way through clouds that encumbered his path in the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph was seen with his sled and oxen breaking a pathway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the drifts of snow; the horses already were harnessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And John Estaugh was standing and taking leave at the threshold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying that he should return at the Meeting in May; while above them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hannah the housemaid, the homely, was looking out of the attic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing aloud at Joseph, then suddenly closing the casement,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the bird in a cuckoo-clock peeps out of its window,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then disappears again, and closes the shutter behind it.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now was the winter gone, and the snow; and Robin the Redbreast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasted on bush and tree it was he, it was he and no other
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had covered with leaves the Babes in the Wood, and blithely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the birds sang with him, and little cared for his boasting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or for his Babes in the Wood, or the Cruel Uncle, and only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang for the mates they had chosen, and cared for the nests they were building.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them, but more sedately and meekly, Elizabeth Haddon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang in her inmost heart, but her lips were silent and songless.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus came the lovely spring with a rush of blossoms and music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding the earth with flowers, and the air with melodies vernal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it came to pass, one pleasant morning, that slowly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the road there came a cavalcade, as of pilgrims
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men and women, wending their way to the Quarterly Meeting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the neighboring town; and with them came riding John Estaugh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Elizabeth's door they stopped to rest, and alighting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasted the currant wine, and the bread of rye, and the honey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought from the hives, that stood by the sunny wall of the garden;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then remounted their horses, refreshed, and continued their journey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Elizabeth with them, and Joseph, and Hannah the housemaid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as they started, Elizabeth lingered a little, and leaning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over her horse's neck, in a whisper said to John Estaugh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tarry awhile behind, for I have something to tell thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be spoken lightly, nor in the presence of others;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them it concerneth not, only thee and me it concerneth."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they rode slowly along through the woods, conversing together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasure to breathe the fragrant air of the forest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasure to live on that bright and happy May morning!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elizabeth said, though still with a certain reluctance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if impelled to reveal a secret she fain would have guarded:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will no longer conceal what is laid upon me to tell thee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received from the Lord a charge to love thee, John Estaugh."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And John Estaugh made answer, surprised by the words she had spoken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pleasant to me are thy converse, thy ways, thy meekness of spirit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasant thy frankness of speech, and thy soul's immaculate whiteness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love without dissimulation, a holy and inward adorning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have yet no light to lead me, no voice to direct me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Lord's work is done, and the toil and the labor completed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath appointed to me, I will gather into the stillness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my own heart awhile, and listen and wait for his guidance."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Elizabeth said, not troubled nor wounded in spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So is it best, John Estaugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not speak of it further.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hath been laid upon me to tell thee this, for to-morrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art going away, across the sea, and I know not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I shall see thee more; but if the Lord hath decreed it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt return again to seek me here and to find me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they rode onward in silence, and entered the town with the others.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ships that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now went on as of old the quiet life of the homestead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient and unrepining Elizabeth labored, in all things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindful not of herself, but bearing the burdens of others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always thoughtful and kind and untroubled; and Hannah the housemaid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diligent early and late, and rosy with washing and scouring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still as of old disparaged the eminent merits of Joseph,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was at times reproved for her light and frothy behavior,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her shy looks, and her careless words, and her evil surmisings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being pressed down somewhat like a cart with sheaves overladen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she would sometimes say to Joseph, quoting the Scriptures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile John Estaugh departed across the sea, and departing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carried hid in his heart a secret sacred and precious,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling its chambers with fragrance, and seeming to him in its sweetness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's ointment of spikenard, that filled all the house with its odor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O lost days of delight, that are wasted in doubting and waiting!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O lost hours and days in which we might have been happy!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the light shone at last, and guided his wavering footsteps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at last came the voice, imperative, questionless, certain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then John Estaugh came back o'er the sea for the gift that was offered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than houses and lands, the gift of a woman's affection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the First-Day that followed, he rose in the Silent Assembly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding in his strong hand a hand that trembled a little,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promising to be kind and true and faithful in all things.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the marriage-rites of John and Elizabeth Estaugh.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not otherwise Joseph, the honest, the diligent servant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sped in his bashful wooing with homely Hannah the housemaid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when he asked her the question, she answered, "Nay"; and then added
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But thee may make believe, and see what will come of it, Joseph."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pleasant and a winsome tale,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student said, "though somewhat pale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quiet in its coloring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it caught its tone and air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gray suits that Quakers wear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet worthy of some German bard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebel, or Voss, or Eberhard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who love of humble themes to sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In humble verse; but no more true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than was the tale I told to you."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian made reply,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with some warmth, "That I deny;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is no invention of my own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But something well and widely known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To readers of a riper age,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ by the skilful hand that wrote
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian tale of Hobomok,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Philothea's classic page.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it like a waif afloat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or dulse uprooted from its rock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the swift tides that ebb and flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In daily papers, and at flood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear freighted vessels to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But later, when the ebb is low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave a long waste of sand and mud."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It matters little," quoth the Jew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cloak of truth is lined with lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sayeth some proverb old and wise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love is master of all arts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And puts it into human hearts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strangest things to say and do."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here the controversy closed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abruptly, ere 't was well begun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Sicilian interposed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With, "Lordlings, listen, every one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That listen may, unto a tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's merrier than the nightingale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale that cannot boast, forsooth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single rag or shred of truth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not leave the mind in doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the with it or without;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A naked falsehood and absurd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mortal ever told or heard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I tell it; or, maybe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply because it pleases me."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SICILIAN'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once on a time, some centuries ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hot sunshine two Franciscan friars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wended their weary way with footsteps slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to their convent, whose white walls and spires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed on the hillside like a patch of snow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered with dust they were, and torn by briers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore like sumpter-mules upon their backs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge of poverty, their beggar's sacks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first was Brother Anthony, a spare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silent man, with pallid cheeks and thin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much given to vigils, penance, fasting, prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemn and gray, and worn with discipline,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if his body but white ashes were,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaped on the living coals that glowed within;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple monk, like many of his day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose instinct was to listen and obey.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A different man was Brother Timothy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of larger mould and of a coarser paste;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rubicund and stalwart monk was he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad in the shoulders, broader in the waist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who often filled the dull refectory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With noise by which the convent was disgraced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to the mass-book gave but little heed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By reason he had never learned to read.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as they passed the outskirts of a wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw, with mingled pleasure and surprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast tethered to a tree an ass, that stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazily winking his large, limpid eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer Gilbert of that neighborhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His owner was, who, looking for supplies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fagots, deeper in the wood had strayed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving his beast to ponder in the shade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Brother Timothy espied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient animal, he said: "Good-lack!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus for our needs doth Providence provide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll lay our wallets on the creature's back."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being done, he leisurely untied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From head and neck the halter of the jack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put it round his own, and to the tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood tethered fast as if the ass were he.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, bursting forth into a merry laugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried to Brother Anthony: "Away!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drive the ass before you with your staff;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you reach the convent you may say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You left me at a farm, half tired and half
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill with a fever, for a night and day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the farmer lent this ass to bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our wallets, that are heavy with good fare."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Brother Anthony, who knew the pranks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Brother Timothy, would not persuade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or reason with him on his quirks and cranks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, being obedient, silently obeyed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, smiting with his staff the ass's flanks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove him before him over hill and glade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe with his provend to the convent gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving poor Brother Timothy to his fate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gilbert, laden with fagots for his fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth issued from the wood, and stood aghast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the ponderous body of the friar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing where he had left his donkey last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling he stood, and dared not venture nigher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stared, and gaped, and crossed himself full fast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, being credulous and of little wit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it was some demon from the pit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While speechless and bewildered thus he gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropped his load of fagots on the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth Brother Timothy: "Be not amazed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That where you left a donkey should be found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poor Franciscan friar, half-starved and crazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing demure and with a halter bound;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But set me free, and hear the piteous story
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Brother Timothy of Casal-Maggiore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a sinful man, although you see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wear the consecrated cowl and cape;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never owned an ass, but you owned me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed and transformed from my own natural shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All for the deadly sin of gluttony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which I could not otherwise escape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than by this penance, dieting on grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And being worked and beaten as an ass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think of the ignominy I endured;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the miserable life I led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toil and blows to which I was inured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wretched lodging in a windy shed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My scanty fare so grudgingly procured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damp and musty straw that formed my bed!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, having done this penance for my sins,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life as man and monk again begins."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple Gilbert, hearing words like these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was conscience-stricken, and fell down apace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the friar upon his bended knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a suppliant voice implored his grace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good monk, now very much at ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted him pardon with a smiling face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor could refuse to be that night his guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It being late, and he in need of rest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a hillside, where the olive thrives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With figures painted on its white-washed walls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cottage stood; and near the humming hives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made murmurs as of far-off waterfalls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place where those who love secluded lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might live content, and, free from noise and brawls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Claudian's Old Man of Verona here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measure by fruits the slow-revolving year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, coming to this cottage of content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found his children, and the buxom wench
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, Dame Cicely, and his father, bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With years and labor, seated on a bench,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeating over some obscure event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old wars of Milanese and French;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All welcomed the Franciscan, with a sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sacred awe and humble reverence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gilbert told them what had come to pass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beyond question, cavil, or surmise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Brother Timothy had been their ass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have seen the wonder in their eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have heard them cry, "Alas! alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have heard their lamentations and their sighs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all believed the story, and began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see a saint in this afflicted man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith there was prepared a grand repast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To satisfy the craving of the friar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so rigid and prolonged a fast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bustling housewife stirred the kitchen fire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then her two barnyard fowls, her best and last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were put to death, at her express desire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And served up with a salad in a bowl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flasks of country wine to crown the whole.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be believed should I repeat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How hungry Brother Timothy appeared;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasure but to see him eat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white teeth flashing through his russet beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face aglow and flushed with wine and meat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His roguish eyes that rolled and laughed and leered!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord! how he drank the blood-red country wine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the village vintage were divine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the while he talked without surcease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told his merry tales with jovial glee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never flagged, but rather did increase,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laughed aloud as if insane were he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wagged his red beard, matted like a fleece,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cast such glances at Dame Cicely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Gilbert now grew angry with his guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus in words his rising wrath expressed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good father," said he, "easily we see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How needful in some persons, and how right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortification of the flesh may be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indulgence you have given it to-night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After long penance, clearly proves to me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your strength against temptation is but slight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shows the dreadful peril you are in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a relapse into your deadly sin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To-morrow morning, with the rising sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go back unto your convent, nor refrain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From fasting and from scourging, for you run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great danger to become an ass again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since monkish flesh and asinine are one;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore be wise, nor longer here remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you wish the scourge should be applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By other hands, that will not spare your hide."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this the monk had heard, his color fled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then returned, like lightning in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he was all one blush from foot to head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the bald spot in his russet hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned from its usual pallor to bright red!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was asleep upon his chair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all retired, and sank into the deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And helpless imbecility of sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They slept until the dawn of day drew near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the cock should have crowed, but did not crow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they had slain the shining chanticleer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eaten him for supper, as you know.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk was up betimes and of good cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, having breakfasted, made haste to go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he heard the distant matin bell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had but little time to say farewell.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh was the morning as the breath of kine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odors of herbs commingled with the sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balsamic exhalations of the pine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A haze was in the air presaging heat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprose the sun above the Apennine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the misty valleys at its feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were full of the delirious song of birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of men, and bells, and low of herds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this to Brother Timothy was naught;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care for scenery, nor here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His busy fancy found the thing it sought;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he saw the convent walls appear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smoke from kitchen chimneys upward caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whirled aloft into the atmosphere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickened his slow footsteps, like a beast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scents the stable a league off at least.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he entered though the convent gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw there in the court the ass, who stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twirling his ears about, and seemed to wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he found him waiting in the wood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told the Prior that, to alleviate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily labors of the brotherhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner, being a man of means and thrift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bestowed him on the convent as a gift.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereupon the Prior for many days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolved this serious matter in his mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned it over many different ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping that some safe issue he might find;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stood in fear of what the world would say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he accepted presents of this kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employing beasts of burden for the packs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lazy monks should carry on their backs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, to avoid all scandal of the sort,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stop the mouth of cavil, he decreed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he would cut the tedious matter short,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sell the ass with all convenient speed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus saving the expense of his support,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hoarding something for a time of need.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he despatched him to the neighboring Fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And freed himself from cumber and from care.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened now by chance, as some might say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others perhaps would call it destiny,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilbert was at the Fair; and heard a bray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nearer came, and saw that it was he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispered in his ear, "Ah, lackaday!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good father, the rebellious flesh, I see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has changed you back into an ass again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my admonitions were in vain."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ass, who felt this breathing in his ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not turn round to look, but shook his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he were not pleased these words to hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And contradicted all that had been said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this made Gilbert cry in voice more clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you well; your hair is russet-red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not deny it; for you are the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franciscan friar, and Timothy by name."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ass, though now the secret had come out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was obstinate, and shook his head again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a crowd was gathered round about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear this dialogue between the twain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And raised their voices in a noisy shout
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gilbert tried to make the matter plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flouted him and mocked him all day long
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With laughter and with jibes and scraps of song.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this be Brother Timothy," they cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buy him, and feed him on the tenderest grass;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou canst not do too much for one so tried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to be twice transformed into an ass."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So simple Gilbert bought him, and untied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His halter, and o'er mountain and morass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He led him homeward, talking as he went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of good behavior and a mind content.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children saw them coming, and advanced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouting with joy, and hung about his neck,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Gilbert's, but the ass's,--round him danced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wove green garlands where-withal to deck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sacred person; for again it chanced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their childish feelings, without rein or check,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not discriminate in any way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A donkey from a friar of Orders Gray.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Brother Timothy," the children said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have come back to us just as before;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were afraid, and thought that you were dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we should never see you any more."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they kissed the white star on his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like a birth-mark or a badge he wore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And patted him upon the neck and face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said a thousand things with childish grace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thenceforward and forever he was known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Brother Timothy, and led alway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A life of luxury, till he had grown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ungrateful being stuffed with corn and hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very vicious.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in angry tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rousing himself, poor Gilbert said one day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When simple kindness is misunderstood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little flagellation may do good."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His many vices need not here be told;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them was a habit that he had
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flinging up his heels at young and old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking his halter, running off like mad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er pasture-lands and meadow, wood and wold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other misdemeanors quite as bad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But worst of all was breaking from his shed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, and ravaging the cabbage-bed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Brother Timothy went back once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his old life of labor and distress;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was beaten worse than he had been before.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, instead of comfort and caress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came labors manifold and trials sore;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as his toils increased his food grew less,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last the great consoler, Death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ended his many sufferings with his breath.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great was the lamentation when he died;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mainly that he died impenitent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dame Cicely bewailed, the children cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man still remembered the event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the French war, and Gilbert magnified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His many virtues, as he came and went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "Heaven pardon Brother Timothy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep us from the sin of gluttony."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Signor Luigi," said the Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Sicilian's tale was told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The were-wolf is a legend old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the were-ass is something new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet for one I think it true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of wonder have not ceased
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are beasts in forms of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sure it happens now and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why may not man become a beast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In way of punishment at least?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this I will not now discuss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave the theme, that we may thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remain within the realm of song.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story that I told before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not acceptable to all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least you did not find too long.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg you, let me try again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With something in a different vein,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you bid the curtain fall.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile keep watch upon the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor let the Landlord leave his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest he should vanish into air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus elude our search once more."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus saying, from his lips he blew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little cloud of perfumed breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, as if it were a clew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead his footsteps safely through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Began his tale as followeth.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE SPANISH JEW'S SECOND TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCANDERBEG

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is fought and won
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By King Ladislaus the Hun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fire of hell and death's frost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of Pentecost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in rout before his path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the field of battle red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flee all that are not dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the army of Amurath.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iskander, the pride and boast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that mighty Othman host,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his routed Turks, takes flight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the battle fought and lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of Pentecost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving behind him dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Amurath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vanguard as it led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rearguard as it fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mown down in the bloody swath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the battle's aftermath.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he cared not for Hospodars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor for Baron or Voivode,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on through the night he rode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gazed at the fateful stars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That were shining overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But smote his steed with his staff,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled to himself, and said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the time to laugh."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a halt of the hurrying flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came a Scribe of the King
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing his signet ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said in a voice severe:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first dark blot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On thy name, George Castriot!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas why art thou here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the army of Amurath slain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left on the battle plain?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iskander answered and said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They lie on the bloody sod
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the hoofs of horses trod;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this was the decree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the watchers overhead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the war belongeth to God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in battle who are we,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are we, that shall withstand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of his lifted hand?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he bade them bind with chains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man of books and brains;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Scribe said: "What misdeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I done, that, without need,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou doest to me this thing?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iskander answering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said unto him: "Not one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misdeed to me hast thou done;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for fear that thou shouldst run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hide thyself from me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I done this unto thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now write me a writing, O Scribe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a blessing be on thy tribe!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A writing sealed with thy ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To King Amurath's Pasha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Croia,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city moated and walled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he surrender the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of my master, the King;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what is writ in his name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can never be recalled."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Scribe bowed low in dread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unto Iskander said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allah is great and just,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are as ashes and dust;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall I do this thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I know that my guilty head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be forfeit to the King?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then swift as a shooting star
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curved and shining blade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Iskander's scimetar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its sheath, with jewels bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot, as he thundered: "Write!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trembling Scribe obeyed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrote in the fitful glare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bivouac fire apart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the chill of the midnight air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his forehead white and bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chill of death in his heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again Iskander cried:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now follow whither I ride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For here thou must not stay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt be as my dearest friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And honors without end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall surround thee on every side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And attend thee night and day."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sullen Scribe replied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our pathways here divide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine leadeth not thy way."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even as he spoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell a sudden scimetar-stroke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When no one else was near;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Scribe sank to the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a stone, pushed from the brink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a black pool, might sink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sob and disappear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no one saw the deed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the stillness around
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound was heard but the sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the hoofs of Iskander's steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As forward he sprang with a bound.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then onward he rode and afar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With scarce three hundred men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through river and forest and fen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the mountains of Argentar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heart was merry within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he crossed the river Drin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw in the gleam of the morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Castle Ak-Hissar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city Croia called,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city moated and walled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city where he was born,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above it the morning star.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his trumpeters in the van
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their silver bugles blew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in crowds about him ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albanian and Turkoman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sound together drew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he feasted with his friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they were warm with wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "O friends of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold what fortune sends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what the fates design!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Amurath commands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my father's wide domain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city and all its lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be given to me again."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the Castle White
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rode in regal state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And entered in at the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all his arms bedight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave to the Pasha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who ruled in Croia
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writing of the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sealed with his signet ring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Pasha bowed his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after a silence said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allah is just and great!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I yield to the will divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city and lands are thine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall contend with fate?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon from the castle walls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crescent banner falls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the crowd beholds instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a portent in the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iskander's banner fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Eagle with double head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a shout ascends on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For men's souls are tired of the Turks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their wicked ways and works,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have made of Ak-Hissar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city of the plague;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the loud, exultant cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That echoes wide and far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is: "Long live Scanderbeg!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thus Iskander came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more unto his own;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tidings, like the flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a conflagration blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the winds of summer, ran,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the land was in a blaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cities far and near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sayeth Ben Joshua Ben Meir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Book of the Words of the Days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Were taken as a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would take the tip of his ear."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now that is after my own heart,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poet cried; "one understands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your swarthy hero Scanderbeg,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gauntlet on hand and boot on leg,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And skilled in every warlike art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding through his Albanian lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And following the auspicious star
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shone for him o'er Ak-Hissar."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian added here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His word of praise not less sincere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he ended with a jibe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hero of romance and song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was born," he said, "to right the wrong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I approve; but all the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bit of treason with the Scribe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adds nothing to your hero's fame."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student praised the good old times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And liked the canter of the rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had a hoofbeat in their sound;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But longed some further word to hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the old chronicler Ben Meir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where his volume might he found.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall Musician walked the room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With folded arms and gleaming eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he saw the Vikings rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gigantic shadows in the gloom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And much he talked of their emprise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meteors seen in Northern skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Heimdal's horn, and day of doom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Sicilian laughed again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the time to laugh," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the whole story he well knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was an invention of the Jew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spun from the cobwebs in his brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the same bright scarlet thread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was the Tale of Kambalu.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Landlord spake no word;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was doubtful whether he had heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tale at all, so full of care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was he of his impending fate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, like the sword of Damocles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above his head hung blank and bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspended by a single hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that he could not sit at ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sighed and looked disconsolate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shifted restless in his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolving how he might evade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blow of the descending blade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student came to his relief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By saying in his easy way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Musician: "Calm your grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fair Apollo of the North,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balder the Beautiful and so forth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although your magic lyre or lute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With broken strings is lying mute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still you can tell some doleful tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shipwreck in a midnight gale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or something of the kind to suit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood that we are in to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what is marvellous and strange;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So give your nimble fancy range,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we will follow in its flight."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Musician shook his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No tale I tell to-night," he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While my poor instrument lies there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as a child with vacant stare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies in its little coffin dead."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, being urged, he said at last:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There comes to me out of the Past
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice, whose tones are sweet and wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing a song almost divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a tear in every line;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ancient ballad, that my nurse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang to me when I was a child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accents tender as the verse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes wept, and sometimes smiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While singing it, to see arise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of wonder in my eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel my heart with tenor beat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple ballad I retain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly imprinted on my brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a tale will now repeat"



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MUSICIAN'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MOTHER'S GHOST

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Svend Dyring he rideth adown the glade;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself was young!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he hath wooed him so winsome a maid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair words gladden so many a heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together were they for seven years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And together children six were theirs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came Death abroad through the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blighted the beautiful lily-wand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Svend Dyring he rideth adown the glade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again hath he wooed him another maid,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath wooed him a maid and brought home a bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was bitter and full of pride.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came driving into the yard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the six children weeping so hard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the small children with sorrowful heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From before her feet she thrust them apart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave to them neither ale nor bread;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye shall suffer hunger and hate," she said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took from them their quilts of blue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "Ye shall lie on the straw we strew."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took from them the great waxlight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now ye shall lie in the dark at night."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening late they cried with cold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother heard it under the mould.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman heard it the earth below:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To my little children I must go."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She standeth before the Lord of all:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And may I go to my children small?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She prayed him so long, and would not cease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he bade her depart in peace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At cock-crow thou shalt return again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longer thou shalt not there remain!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She girded up her sorrowful bones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rifted the walls and the marble stones.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As through the village she flitted by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watch-dogs howled aloud to the sky.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came to the castle gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood her eldest daughter in wait.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why standest thou here, dear daughter mine?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How fares it with brothers and sisters thine?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never art thou mother of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my mother was both fair and fine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mother was white, with cheeks of red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou art pale, and like to the dead."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How should I be fair and fine?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been dead; pale cheeks are mine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How should I be white and red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long, so long have I been dead?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came in at the chamber door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the small children weeping sore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One she braided, another she brushed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third she lifted, the fourth she hushed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth she took on her lap and pressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she would suckle it at her breast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to her eldest daughter said she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do thou bid Svend Dyring come hither to me."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the chamber when he came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spake to him in anger and shame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left behind me both ale and bread;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children hunger and are not fed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left behind me quilts of blue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children lie on the straw ye strew.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left behind me the great waxlight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children lie in the dark at night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I come again unto your hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As cruel a fate shall you befall!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now crows the cock with feathers red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the earth must all the dead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now crows the cock with feathers swart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of heaven fly wide apart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now crows the cock with feathers white;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can abide no longer to-night."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever they heard the watch-dogs wail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gave the children bread and ale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever they heard the watch-dogs bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feared lest the dead were on their way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever they heard the watch-dogs bark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself was young!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feared the dead out there in the dark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair words gladden so many a heart.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched by the pathos of these rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian said: "All praise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be to the ballads of old times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the bards of simple ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who walked with Nature hand in hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose country was their Holy Land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose singing robes were homespun brown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From looms of their own native town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which they were not ashamed to wear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not of silk or sendal gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor decked with fanciful array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cockle-shells from Outre-Mer."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the Student answered: "Yes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All praise and honor!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I confess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bread and ale, home-baked, home-brewed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are wholesome and nutritious food,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not enough for all our needs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poets--the best of them--are birds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of passage; where their instinct leads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They range abroad for thoughts and words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from all climes bring home the seeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That germinate in flowers or weeds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not fowls in barnyards born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cackle o'er a grain of corn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if you shut the horizon down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the small limits of their town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you but degrade your bard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he at last becomes as one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thinks the all-encircling sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rises and sets in his back yard?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theologian said again:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be so; yet I maintain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That what is native still is best,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And little care I for the rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is a long story; time would fail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell it, and the hour is late;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not waste it in debate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But listen to our Landlord's tale."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus the sword of Damocles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending not by slow degrees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly, on the Landlord fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who blushing, and with much demur
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many vain apologies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plucking up heart, began to tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rhyme of one Sir Christopher.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE LANDLORD'S TALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Sir Christopher Gardiner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight of the Holy Sepulchre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Merry England over the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stepped upon this continent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if his august presence lent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glory to the colony.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have seen him in the street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the little Boston of Winthrop's time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His rapier dangling at his feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doublet and hose and boots complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Rupert hat with ostrich plume,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloves that exhaled a faint perfume,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxuriant curls and air sublime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And superior manners now obsolete!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a way of saying things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made one think of courts and kings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lords and ladies of high degree;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that not having been at court
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed something very little short
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of treason or lese-majesty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an accomplished knight was he.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dwelling was just beyond the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At what he called his country-seat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, careless of Fortune's smile or frown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weary grown of the world and its ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wished to pass the rest of his days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a private life and a calm retreat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a double life was the life he led,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, while professing to be in search
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a godly course, and willing, he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, anxious to join the Puritan church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made of all this but small account,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed his idle hours instead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With roystering Morton of Merry Mount,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pettifogger from Furnival's Inn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of misrule and riot and sin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who looked on the wine when it was red.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This country-seat was little more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than a cabin of log's; but in front of the door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A modest flower-bed thickly sown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sweet alyssum and columbine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made those who saw it at once divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The touch of some other hand than his own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first it was whispered, and then it was known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he in secret was harboring there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little lady with golden hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he called his cousin, but whom he had wed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Italian manner, as men said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And great was the scandal everywhere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But worse than this was the vague surmise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though none could vouch for it or aver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Knight of the Holy Sepulchre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was only a Papist in disguise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the more to imbitter their bitter lives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the more to trouble the public mind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came letters from England, from two other wives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he had carelessly left behind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of them letters of such a kind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As made the governor hold his breath;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one imploring him straight to send
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The husband home, that he might amend;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other asking his instant death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the only way to make an end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wary governor deemed it right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all this wickedness was revealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To send his warrant signed and sealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take the body of the knight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with this mighty instrument,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal, mounting his gallant steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode forth from town at the top of his speed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And followed by all his bailiffs bold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if on high achievement bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To storm some castle or stronghold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenge the warders on the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seize in his ancestral hall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A robber-baron grim and old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when though all the dust and heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to Sir Christopher's country-seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No knight he found, nor warder there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the little lady with golden hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was gathering in the bright sunshine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet alyssum and columbine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While gallant Sir Christopher, all so gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being forewarned, through the postern gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his castle wall had tripped away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was keeping a little holiday
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forests, that bounded his estate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as a trusty squire and true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal searched the castle through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not crediting what the lady said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searched from cellar to garret in vain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, finding no knight, came out again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And arrested the golden damsel instead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore her in triumph into the town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from her eyes the tears rolled down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sweet alyssum and columbine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she held in her fingers white and fine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor's heart was moved to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fair a creature caught within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snares of Satan and of sin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he read her a little homily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the folly and wickedness of the lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of women, half cousins and half wives;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, seeing that naught his words availed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent her away in a ship that sailed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Merry England over the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the other two wives in the old countree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To search her further, since he had failed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come at the heart of the mystery.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Sir Christopher wandered away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through pathless woods for a month and a day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shooting pigeons, and sleeping at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the noble savage, who took delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his feathered hat and his velvet vest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gun and his rapier and the rest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as soon as the noble savage heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a bounty was offered for this gay bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to slay him out of hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring in his beautiful scalp for a show,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the glossy head of a kite or crow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he was made to understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wanted the bird alive, not dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he followed him whithersoever he fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through forest and field, and hunted him down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brought him prisoner into the town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! it was a rueful sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see this melancholy knight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a dismal and hapless case;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hat deformed by stain and dent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His plumage broken, his doublet rent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beard and flowing locks forlorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matted, dishevelled, and unshorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His boots with dust and mire besprent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dignified in his disgrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wearing an unblushing face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus before the magistrate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood to hear the doom of fate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain he strove with wonted ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To modify and extenuate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His evil deeds in church and state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For gone was now his power to please;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his pompous words had no more weight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than feathers flying in the breeze.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With suavity equal to his own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governor lent a patient ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the speech evasive and highflown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which he endeavored to make clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That colonial laws were too severe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When applied to a gallant cavalier,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentleman born, and so well known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And accustomed to move in a higher sphere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this the Puritan governor heard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deigned in answer never a word;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in summary manner shipped away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a vessel that sailed from Salem bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This splendid and famous cavalier,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his Rupert hat and his popery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Merry England over the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As being unmeet to inhabit here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus endeth the Rhyme of Sir Christopher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight of the Holy Sepulchre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first who furnished this barren land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With apples of Sodom and ropes of sand.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FINALE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the tales those merry guests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told to each other, well or ill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like summer birds that lift their crests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the borders of their nests
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twitter, and again are still.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the tales, or new or old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In idle moments idly told;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers of the field with petals thin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilies that neither toil nor spin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tufts of wayside weeds and gorse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung in the parlor of the inn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the sign of the Red Horse.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still, reluctant to retire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friends sat talking by the fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watched the smouldering embers burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ashes, and flash up again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a momentary glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingering like them when forced to go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And going when they would remain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on the morrow they must turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their faces homeward, and the pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of parting touched with its unrest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tender nerve in every breast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sleep at last the victory won;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must be stirring with the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drowsily good night they said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went still gossiping to bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left the parlor wrapped in gloom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only live thing in the room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the old clock, that in its pace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept time with the revolving spheres
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And constellations in their flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And struck with its uplifted mace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark, unconscious hours of night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To senseless and unlistening ears.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprose the sun; and every guest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprisen, was soon equipped and dressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For journeying home and city-ward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old stage-coach was at the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With horses harnessed, long before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunshine reached the withered sward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the oaks, whose branches hoar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmured: "Farewell forevermore."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" the portly Landlord cried;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" the parting guests replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But little thought that nevermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their feet would pass that threshold o'er;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nevermore together there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would they assemble, free from care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear the oaks' mysterious roar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathe the wholesome country air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are they now?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What lands and skies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paint pictures in their friendly eyes?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What hope deludes, what promise cheers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What pleasant voices fill their ears?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two are beyond the salt sea waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three already in their graves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance the living still may look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the pages of this book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see the days of long ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating and fleeting to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the well-remembered brook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the inverted landscape gleam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their own faces like a dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up upon them from below.

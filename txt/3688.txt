<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh hard is the bed they have made him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And common the blanket and cheap;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there he will lie as they laid him:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where else could you trust him to sleep?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleep when the bugle is crying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cravens have heard and are brave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When mothers and sweethearts are sighing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lads are in love with the grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh dark is the chamber and lonely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lights and companions depart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lief will he lose them and only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold the desire of his heart.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And low is the roof, but it covers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sleeper content to repose;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far from his friends and his lovers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lies with the sweetheart he chose.

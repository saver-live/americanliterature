<p> I am small because I am a little child. I shall be big when I am as old as my father is.<br> My teacher will come and say, "It is late, bring your slate and your books."<br> I shall tell him, "Do you not know I am as big as father? And I must not have lessons any more."<br> My master will wonder and say, "He can leave his books if he likes, for he is grown up."<br> I shall dress myself and walk to the fair where the crowd is thick.<br> My uncle will come rushing up to me and say, "You will get lost, my boy; let me carry you."<br> I shall answer, "Can't you see, uncle, I am as big as father. I must go to the fair alone."<br> Uncle will say, "Yes, he can go wherever he likes, for he is grown up."<br> Mother will come from her bath when I am giving money to my nurse, for I shall know how to open the box with my key.<br> Mother will say, "What are you about, naughty child?"<br> I shall tell her, "Mother, don't you know, I am as big as father, and I must give silver to my nurse."<br> Mother will say to herself, "He can give money to whom he likes, for he is grown up."<br> In the holiday time in October father will come home and, thinking that I am still a baby, will bring for me from the town little shoes and small silken frocks.<br> I shall say, "Father, give them to my dâdâ [elder brother], for I am as big as you are."<br> Father will think and say, "He can buy his own clothes if he likes, for he is grown up."</p>

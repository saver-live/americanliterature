<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I lay in my bed slepe full unmete
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was unto me, but why that I ne might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest I ne wist, for there n'as erthly wight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[As I suppose] had more of hertis ese
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I, for I n'ad sicknesse nor disese. - Chaucer


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more gentle than a wind in summer?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more soothing than the pretty hummer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That stays one moment in an open flower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a green island, far from all men's knowing?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More healthful than the leafiness of dales?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More secret than a nest of nightingales?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More serene than Cordelia's countenance?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More full of visions than a high romance?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, but thee Sleep? Soft closer of our eyes!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low murmurer of tender lullabies!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light hoverer around our happy pillows!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wreather of poppy buds, and weeping willows!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent entangler of a beauty's tresses!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most happy listener! when the morning blesses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That glance so brightly at the new sun-rise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is higher beyond thought than thee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresher than berries of a mountain tree?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More strange, more beautiful, more smooth, more regal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than wings of swans, than doves, than dim-seen eagle?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it? And to what shall I compare it?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a glory, and naught else can share it:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought thereof is awful, sweet, and holy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing away all worldliness and folly;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the low rumblings earth's regions under;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes like a gentle whispering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the secrets of some wond'rous thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That breathes about us in the vacant air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that we look around with prying stare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps to see shapes of light, aerial limning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch soft floatings from a faint-heard hymning;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the laurel wreath, on high suspended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to crown our name when life is ended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it gives a glory to the voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the heart up-springs, rejoice! rejoice!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds which will reach the Framer of all things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And die away in ardent mutterings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one who once the glorious sun has seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the clouds, and felt his bosom clean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his great Maker's presence, but must know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 'tis I mean, and feel his being glow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore no insult will I give his spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By telling what he sees from native merit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Poesy! for thee I hold my pen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That am not yet a glorious denizen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy wide heaven- Should I rather kneel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon some mountain-top until I feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glowing splendour round about me hung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And echo back the voice of thine own tongue?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Poesy! for thee I grasp my pen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That am not yet a glorious denizen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy wide heaven; yet, to my ardent prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yield from thy sanctuary some clear air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth'd for intoxication by the breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowering bays, that I may die a death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of luxury, and my young spirit follow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning sun-beams to the great Apollo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a fresh sacrifice; or, if I can bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The o'erwhelming sweets, 'twill bring to me the fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visions of all places: a bowery nook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be elysium- an eternal book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence I may copy many a lovely saying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the leaves, and flowers- about the playing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nymphs in woods, and fountains; and the shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping a silence round a sleeping maid;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a verse from so strange influence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we must ever wonder how, and whence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came. Also imaginings will hover
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round my fire-side, and haply there discover
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vistas of solemn beauty, where I'd wander
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In happy silence, like the clear Meander
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through its lone vales; and where I found a spot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of awfuller shade, or an enchanted grot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a green hill o'erspread with chequer'd dress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowers, and fearful from its loveliness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write on my tablets all that was permitted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that was for our human senses fitted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the events of this wide world I'd seize
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a strong giant, and my spirit teaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at its shoulders it should proudly see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wings to find out an immortality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop and consider! life is but a day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fragile dew-drop on its perilous way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a tree's summit; a poor Indian's sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Montmorenci. Why so sad a moan?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is the rose's hope while yet unblown;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reading of an ever-changing tale;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light uplifting of a maiden's veil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pigeon tumbling in clear summer air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A laughing school-boy, without grief or care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding the springy branches of an elm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O for ten years, that I may overwhelm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself in poesy; so I may do the deed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my own soul has to itself decreed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then will I pass the countries that I see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In long perspective, and continually
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taste their pure fountains. First the realm I'll pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Flora, and old Pan: sleep in the grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feed upon apples red, and strawberries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And choose each pleasure that my fancy sees;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch the white-handed nymphs in shady places,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To woo sweet kisses from averted faces,-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play with their fingers, touch their shoulders white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a pretty shrinking with a bite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hard as lips can make it: till agreed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lovely tale of human life we'll read.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one will teach a tame dove how it best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May fan the cool air gently o'er my rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another, bending o'er her nimble tread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will set a green robe floating round her head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still will dance with ever varied ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling upon the flowers and the trees:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another will entice me on, and on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in the bosom of a leafy world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rest in silence, like two gems upcurl'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recesses of a pearly shell.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can I ever bid these joys farewell?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I must pass them for a nobler life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I may find the agonies, the strife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human hearts: for lo! I see afar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ersailing the blue cragginess, a car
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And steeds with streamy manes- the charioteer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks out upon the winds with glorious fear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a huge cloud's ridge; and now with sprightly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheel downward come they into fresher skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tipt round with silver from the sun's bright eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still downward with capacious whirl they glide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I see them on the green-hill's side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In breezy rest among the nodding stalks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the trees and mountains; and there soon appear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shapes of delight, of mystery, and fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing along before a dusky space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by some mighty oaks: as they would chase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ever-fleeting music on they sweep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some with upholden hand and mouth severe;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some with their faces muffled to the ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go glad and smilingly athwart the gloom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some looking back, and some with upward gaze;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, thousands in a thousand different ways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flit onward- now a lovely wreath of girls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now broad wings. Most awfully intent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of those steeds is forward bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seems to listen: O that I might know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that he writes with such a hurrying glow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visions all are fled the car is fled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the light of heaven, and in their stead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of real things comes doubly strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like a muddy stream, would bear along
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul to nothingness: but I will strive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against all doubtings, and will keep alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of that same chariot, and the strange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journey it went.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there so small a range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present strength of manhood, that the high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagination cannot freely fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she was wont of old? prepare her steeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paw up against the light, and do strange deeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the clouds? Has she not shown us all?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the clear space of ether, to the small
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breath of new buds unfolding? From the meaning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Jove's large eye-brow, to the tender greening
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of April meadows? Here her altar shone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en in this isle; and who could paragon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fervid choir that lifted up a noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of harmony, to where it aye will poise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mighty self of convoluting sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge as a planet, and like that roll round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternally around a dizzy void?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, in those days the Muses were nigh cloy'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With honors; nor had any other care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could all this be forgotten? Yes, a schism
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurtured by foppery and barbarism,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made great Apollo blush for this his land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men were thought wise who could not understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His glories: with a puling infant's force
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sway'd about upon a rocking horse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought it Pegasus. Ah dismal soul'd!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its gathering waves- ye felt it not. The blue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of summer nights collected still to make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning precious: beauty was awake!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were ye not awake? But ye were dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To things ye knew not of,- were closely wed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To musty laws lined out with wretched rule
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And compass vile: so that ye taught a school
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, like the certain wands of Jacob's wit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their verses tallied. Easy was the task:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Poesy. Ill-fated, impious race!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did not know it,- no, they went about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding a poor, decrepid standard out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark'd with most flimsy mottos, and in large
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of one Boileau!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O ye whose charge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to hover round our pleasant hills!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose congregated majesty so fills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My boundly reverence, that I cannot trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hallowed names, in this unholy place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So near those common folk; did not their shames
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affright you? Did our old lamenting Thames
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delight you? Did ye never cluster round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delicious Avon, with a mournful sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weep? Or did ye wholly bid adieu
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To regions where no more the laurel grew?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or did ye stay to give a welcoming
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some lone spirits who could proudly sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their youth away, and die? 'Twas even so:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me think away those times of woe:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now 'tis a fairer season; ye have breathed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich benedictions o'er us; ye have wreathed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh garlands: for sweet music has been heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many places;- some has been upstirr'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out its crystal dwelling in a lake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a swan's ebon bill; from a thick brake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nested and quiet in a valley mild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bubbles a pipe; fine sounds are floating wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the earth: happy are ye and glad.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are doubtless: yet in truth we've had
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange thunders from the potency of song;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From majesty: but in clear truth the themes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are ugly clubs, the Poets' Polyphemes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disturbing the grand sea. A drainless shower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of light is poesy; 'tis the supreme of power;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis might half slumb'ring on its own right arm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very archings of her eye-lids charm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand willing agents to obey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still she governs with the mildest sway:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But strength alone though of the Muses born
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is like a fallen angel: trees uptorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness, and worms, and shrouds, and sepulchres
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delight it; for it feeds upon the burrs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thorns of life; forgetting the great end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of poesy, that it should be a friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I rejoice: a myrtle fairer than
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'er grew in Paphos, from the bitter weeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifts its sweet head into the air, and feeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent space with ever sprouting green.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nibble the little cupped flowers and sing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then let us clear away the choking thorns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From round its gentle stem; let the young fawns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeaned in after times, when we are flown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find a fresh sward beneath it, overgrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With simple flowers: let there nothing be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More boisterous than a lover's bended knee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought more ungentle than the placid look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one who leans upon a closed book;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between two hills. All hail delightful hopes!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she was wont, th' imagination
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into most lovely labyrinths will be gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they shall be accounted poet kings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who simply tell the most heart-easing things.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O may these joys be ripe before I die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will not some say that I presumptuously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have spoken? that from hastening disgrace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twere better far to hide my foolish face?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That whining boyhood should with reverence bow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the dread thunderbolt could reach? How!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I do hide myself, it sure shall be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very fane, the light of Poesy:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I do fall, at least I will be laid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the silence of a poplar shade;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over me the grass shall be smooth shaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there shall be a kind memorial graven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But off Despondence! miserable bane!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should not know thee, who athirst to gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noble end, are thirsty every hour.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What though I am not wealthy in the dower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of spanning wisdom; though I do not know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shiftings of the mighty winds that blow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither and thither all the changing thoughts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of man: though no great minist'ring reason sorts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out the dark mysteries of human souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clear conceiving: yet there ever rolls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vast idea before me, and I glean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefrom my liberty; thence too I've seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end and aim of Poesy. 'Tis clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As anything most true; as that the year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is made of the four seasons- manifest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a large cross, some old cathedral's crest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted to the white clouds. Therefore should I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be but the essence of deformity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coward, did my very eye-lids wink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At speaking out what I have dared to think.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! rather let me like a madman run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over some precipice; let the hot sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melt my Dedalian wings, and drive me down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convuls'd and headlong! Stay! an inward frown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of conscience bids me be more calm awhile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ocean dim, sprinkled with many an isle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreads awfully before me. How much toil!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many days! what desperate turmoil!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere I can have explored its widenesses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, what a task! upon my bended knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could unsay those- no, impossible!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sweet relief I'll dwell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On humbler thoughts, and let this strange assay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begun in gentleness die so away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en now all tumult from my bosom fades:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn full hearted to the friendly aids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That smooth the path of honour; brotherhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And friendliness the nurse of mutual good.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the brain ere one can think upon it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence when some rhymes are coming out;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they're come, the very pleasant rout:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message certain to be done to-morrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some precious book from out its snug retreat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cluster round it when we next shall meet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce can I scribble on; for lovely airs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many delights of that glad day recalling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first my senses caught their tender falling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with these airs come forms of elegance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stooping their shoulders o'er a horse's prance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careless, and grand-fingers soft and round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parting luxuriant curls;- and the swift bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Bacchus from his chariot, when his eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made Ariadne's cheek look blushingly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I remember all the pleasant flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of words at opening a portfolio.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things such as these are ever harbingers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To trains of peaceful images: the stirs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a swan's neck unseen among the rushes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A linnet starting all about the bushes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A butterfly, with golden wings broad parted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nestling a rose, convuls'd as though it smarted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With over pleasure- many, many more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might I indulge at large in all my store
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of luxuries: yet I must not forget
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep, quiet with his poppy coronet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what there may be worthy in these rhymes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I partly owe to him: and thus, the chimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of friendly voices had just given place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To as sweet a silence, when I 'gan retrace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasant day, upon a couch at ease.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a poet's house who keeps the keys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pleasure's temple. Round about were hung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glorious features of the bards who sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other ages- cold and sacred busts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled at each other. Happy he who trusts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clear Futurity his darling fame!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At swelling apples with a frisky leap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reaching fingers, 'mid a luscious heap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of vine-leaves. Then there rose to view a fane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of liny marble, and thereto a train
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nymphs approaching fairly o'er the sward:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, loveliest, holding her white hand toward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling sun-rise: two sisters sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending their graceful figures till they meet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the trippings of a little child:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some are hearing, eagerly, the wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrilling liquidity of dewy piping.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, in another picture, nymphs are wiping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherishingly Diana's timorous limbs;-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bath's edge, and keeps a gentle motion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the subsiding crystal: as when ocean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothness o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its rocky marge, and balances once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient weeds; that now unshent by foam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel all about their undulating home.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sappho's meek head was there half smiling down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At nothing; just as though the earnest frown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of over thinking had that moment gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From off her brow, and left her all alone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Alfred's too, with anxious, pitying eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he always listened to the sighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the goaded world; and Kosciusko's worn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By horrid suffrance- mightily forlorn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petrarch, outstepping from the shady green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starts at the sight of Laura; nor can wean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes from her sweet face. Most happy they!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over them was seen a free display
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of out-spread wings, and from between them shone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Poesy: from off her throne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She overlook'd things that I scarce could tell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very sense of where I was might well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep Sleep aloof: but more than that there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought after thought to nourish up the flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within my breast; so that the morning light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprised me even from a sleepless night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And up I rose refresh'd, and glad, and gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolving to begin that very day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lines; and howsoever they be done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave them as a father does his son.

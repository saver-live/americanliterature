<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O come Georgiana! the rose is full blown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riches of Flora are lavishly strown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is all softness, and crystal the streams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West is resplendently clothed in beams.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O come! let us haste to the freshening shades,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quaintly carv'd seats, and the opening glades;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the faeries are chanting their evening hymns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the last sun-beam the sylph lightly swims.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when thou art weary I'll find thee a bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mosses and flowers to pillow thy head:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there Georgiana I'll sit at thy feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While my story of love I enraptur'd repeat.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fondly I'll breathe, and so softly I'll sigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt think that some amorous Zephyr is nigh:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet no, as I breathe I will press thy fair knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then thou wilt know that the sigh comes from me.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! why dearest girl should we lose all these blisses?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mortal's a fool who such happiness misses:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So smile acquiescence, and give me thy hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With love-looking eyes, and with voice sweetly bland.
</pre>

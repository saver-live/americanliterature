<p> There once lived in Greece a very wise man whose name was SocÂ´ra-tes. Young men from all parts of the land went to him to learn wisdom from him; and he said so many pleasant things, and said them in so delightful a way, that no one ever grew tired of listening to him. </p><p> One summer he built himself a house, but it was so small that his neighbors wondered how he could be content with it. </p><p> "What is the reason," said they, "that you, who are so great a man, should build such a little box as this for your dwelling house?" </p><p> "Indeed, there may be little reason," said he; "but, small as the place is, I shall think myself happy if I can fill even it with true friends." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cypress stood up like a church
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night we felt our love would hold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saintly moonlight seemed to search
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wash the whole world clean as gold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The olives crystallized the vales'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad slopes until the hills grew strong:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireflies and the nightingales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throbbed each to either, flame and song.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingales, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the angle of its shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cypress stood, self-balanced high;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half up, half down, as double-made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the ground, against the sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we, too! from such soul-height went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leaps of blood, so blindly driven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We scarce knew if our nature meant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most passionate earth or intense heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingales, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We paled with love, we shook with love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We kissed so close we could not vow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Giulio whispered, 'Sweet, above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's Ever guarantees this Now.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through his words the nightingales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove straight and full their long clear call,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like arrows through heroic mails,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love was awful in it all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingales, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O cold white moonlight of the north,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refresh these pulses, quench this hell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O coverture of death drawn forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across this garden-chamber... well!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what have nightingales to do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gloomy England, called the free.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Yes, free to die in!) when we two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are sundered, singing still to me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still they sing, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I hear him, how he cried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My own soul's life' between their notes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each man has but one soul supplied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's immortal. Though his throat's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On fire with passion now, to her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't say what to me he said!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet he moves her, they aver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingales sing through my head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingales, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says to her what moves her most.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would not name his soul within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hearing, rather pays her cost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With praises to her lips and chin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man has but one soul, 'tis ordained,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each soul but one love, I add;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet souls are damned and love's profaned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These nightingales will sing me mad!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingales, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I marvel how the birds can sing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's little difference, in their view,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt our Tuscan trees that spring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As vital flames into the blue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dull round blots of foliage meant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like saturated sponges here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suck the fogs up. As content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he too in this land, 'tis clear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still they sing, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My native Florence! dear, forgone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see across the Alpine ridge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the last feast-day of Saint John
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot rockets from Carraia bridge.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luminous city, tall with fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trod deep down in that river of ours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many a boat with lamp and choir
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skimmed birdlike over glittering towers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not hear these nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to float, we seem to float
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down Arno's stream in festive guise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boat strikes flame into our boat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And up that lady seems to rise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As then she rose. The shock had flashed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vision on us! What a head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What leaping eyeballs! beauty dashed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To splendour by a sudden dread.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still they sing, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too bold to sin, too weak to die;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such women are so. As for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would we had drowned there, he and I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That moment, loving perfectly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had not caught her with her loosed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold ringlets rarer in the south
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor heard the 'Grazie tanto' bruised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sweetness by her English mouth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still they sing, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had not reached him at my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her fine tongue, as snakes indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill flies; nor had I, for my part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yearned after, in my desperate need,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And followed him as he did her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To coasts left bitter by the tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose very nightingales, elsewhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delighting, torture and deride!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For still they sing, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worthless woman! mere cold clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all false things are! but so fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She takes the breath of men away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gaze upon her unaware.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not play her larcenous tricks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have her looks! She lied and stole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spat into my love's pure pyx
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rank saliva of her soul.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still they sing, the nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not for her white and pink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though such he likes her grace of limb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though such he has praised nor yet, I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For life itself, though spent with him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commit such sacrilege, affront
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's nature which is love, intrude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt two affianced souls, and hunt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like spiders, in the altar's wood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot bear these nightingales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she chose sin, some gentler guise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She might have sinned in, so it seems:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She might have pricked out both my eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I still seen him in my dreams!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or drugged me in my soup or wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor left me angry afterward:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To die here with his hand in mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His breath upon me, were not hard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Our Lady hush these nightingales!)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But set a springe for him, 'mio ben',
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only good, my first last love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Christ knows well what sin is, when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees some things done they must move
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself to wonder. Let her pass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of her by night and day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must I too join her out, alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Giulio, in each word I say!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And evermore the nightingales!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giulio, my Giulio! sing they so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you be silent? Do I speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you not hear? An arm you throw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round some one, and I feel so weak?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, owl-like birds! They sing for spite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sing for hate, they sing for doom!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll sing through death who sing through night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll sing and stun me in the tomb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingales, the nightingales!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even thus. I pause to write it out at length,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter of the Lady Waldemar.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I prayed your cousin Leigh to take you this:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says he'll do it. After years of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what is called so, when a woman frets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fools upon one string of a man's name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fingers it for ever till it breaks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may perhaps do for her such a thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she accept it without detriment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she should not love him any more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, who do not love him, nor love you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor you, Aurora, choose you shall repent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your most ungracious letter and confess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constrained by his convictions (he's convinced),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've wronged me foully. Are you made so ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You woman, to impute such ill to me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We both had mothers, lay in their bosom once.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after all, I thank you, Aurora Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For proving to myself that there are things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not do not for my life, nor him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though something I have somewhat overdone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, when I went to see the gods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning on Olympus, with a step
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shook the thunder from a certain cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committing myself vilely. Could I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muse I pulled my heart out from my breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To soften, had herself a sort of heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loved my mortal? He at least loved her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard him say so: 'twas my recompense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, watching at his bedside fourteen days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke out ever like a flame at whiles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the heats of fever, 'Is it thou?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Breathe closer, sweetest mouth!' and when at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fever gone, the wasted face extinct,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it irked him much to know me there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said ''Twas kind, 'twas good, 'twas womanly,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And fifty praises to excuse no love);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But was the picture safe he had ventured for?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, half wandering, 'I have loved her well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Although she could not love me.' 'Say, instead,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered, 'she does love you.' 'Twas my turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rave: I would have married him so changed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the world had jeered me properly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For taking up with Cupid at his worst,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver quiver worn off on his hair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No, no,' he murmured; 'no, she loves me not;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Aurora Leigh does better: bring her book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And read it softly, Lady Waldemar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Until I thank your friendship more for that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Than even for harder service.' So I read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your book, Aurora, for an hour that day:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept its pauses, marked its emphasis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My voice, impaled upon its hooks of rhyme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not once would writhe, nor quiver, nor revolt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read on calmly, calmly shut it up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observing, 'There's some merit in the book;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And yet the merit in't is thrown away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As chances still with women if we write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Or write not: we want string to tie our flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So drop them as we walk, which serves to show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The way we went. Good morning, Mister Leigh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You'll find another reader the next time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A woman who does better than to love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I hate; she will do nothing very well:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Male poets are preferable, straining less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And teaching more.' I triumphed o'er you both,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I saw him afterward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had read your shameful letter, and my heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came with health recovered, strong though pale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Howe and he, a courteous pair of friends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say what men dare say to women, when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their debtors. But I stopped them with a word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And proved I had never trodden such a road
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry so much dirt upon my shoe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, putting into it something of disdain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked, forsooth, his pardon, and my own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For having done no better than to love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that not wisely, though 'twas long ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had been mended radically since.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told him, as I tell you now, Miss Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And proved, I took some trouble for his sake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Because I knew he did not love the girl)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spoil my hands with working in the stream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that poor bubbling nature, till she went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consigned to one I trusted, my own maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who once had lived full five months in my house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Dressed hair superbly), with a lavish purse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry to Australia, where she had left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A husband, said she. If the creature lied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission failed: we all do fail and lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More or less and I'm sorry which is all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected from us when we fail the most
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And go to church to own it. What I meant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was just the best for him, and me, and her . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best even for Marian! I am sorry for't,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very sorry. Yet my creature said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw her stop to speak in Oxford Street
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one . . . no matter! I had sooner cut
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hand off (though 'twere kissed the hour before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And promised a duke's troth-ring for the next)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than crush her silly head with so much wrong.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor child! I would have mended it with gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it gleamed like Saint Sophia's dome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the faithful troop to morning prayer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he, he nipped the bud of such a thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that cold Leigh look which I fancied once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And broke in, 'Henceforth she was called his wife:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'His wife required no succour: he was bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To Florence, to resume this broken bond;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Enough so. Both were happy, he and Howe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To acquit me of the heaviest charge of all '
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which I shot my tongue against my fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And struck him: 'Would he carry he was just
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A letter from me to Aurora Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And ratify from his authentic mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My answer to her accusation?' 'Yes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If such a letter were prepared in time.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's just, your cousin, ay, abhorrently:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd wash his hands in blood, to keep them clean.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, cold, courteous, a mere gentleman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed, we parted.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parted. Face no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice no more, love no more! wiped wholly out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some ill scholar's scrawl from heart and slate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, spit on, and so wiped out utterly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By some coarse scholar! I have been too coarse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too human. Have we business, in our rank,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blood i' the veins? I will have henceforth none,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even to keep the colour at my lip.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rose is pink and pretty without blood:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not a woman? When we've played in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game, to adore, we have resources still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can play on at leisure, being adored:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's Smith already swearing at my feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I'm the typic She. Away with Smith!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith smacks of Leigh, and henceforth I'll admit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No socialist within three crinolines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live and have his being. But for you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though insolent your letter and absurd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though I hate you frankly, take my Smith!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when you have seen this famous marriage tied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A most unspotted Erle to a noble Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(His love astray on one he should not love),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howbeit you may not want his love, beware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll want some comfort. So I leave you Smith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Smith! he talks Leigh's subjects, somewhat worse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopts a thought of Leigh's, and dwindles it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes leagues beyond, to be no inch behind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will mind you of him, as a shoe-string may
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a man: and women, when they are made like you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow tender to a shoe-string, footprint even,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adore averted shoulders in a glass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And memories of what, present once, was loathed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, you loathed not Romney, though you played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 'fox and goose' about him with your soul;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass over fox, you rub out fox, ignore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeling, you eradicate it, the act's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identical.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you joy, Miss Leigh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've made a happy marriage for your friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the honour well-assorted love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derives from you who love him, whom he loves!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need not wish me joy to think of it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have so much. Observe, Aurora Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your droop of eyelid is the same as his,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, but for you, I might have won his love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, to you, I have shown my naked heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which three things, I hate, hate, hate you. Hush!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose a fourth! I cannot choose but think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, with him, I were virtuouser than you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without him: so I hate you from this gulf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hollow of my soul, which opens out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what, except for you, had been my heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is, instead, a place to curse by! Love."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An active kind of curse. I stood there cursed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confounded. I had seized and caught the sense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the letter, with its twenty stinging snakes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment's sweep of eyesight, and I stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dazed. "Ah! not married."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mistake," he said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm married. Is not Marian Erle my wife?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As God sees things, I have a wife and child;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, as I'm a man who honours God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am here to claim them as my child and wife."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt it hard to breathe, much less to speak.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor word of mine was needed. Some one else
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there for answering. "Romney," she began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My great good angel, Romney."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at first,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that Marian Erle was beautiful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood there, still and pallid as a saint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilated, like a saint in ecstasy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the floating moonshine interposed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt her foot and the earth, and raised her up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To float upon it. "I had left my child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sleeps," she said, "and having drawn this way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard you speaking, . . . friend! Confirm me now.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take this Marian, such as wicked men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have made her, for your honourable wife?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrilling, solemn, proud, pathetic voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched his arms out toward that thrilling voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to draw it on to his embrace.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I take her as God made her, and as men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must fail to unmake her, for my honoured wife."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never raised her eyes, nor took a step,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stood there in her place, and spoke again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You take this Marian's child, which is her shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sight of men and women, for your child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of whom you will not ever feel ashamed?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrilling, tender, proud, pathetic voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped on toward it, still with outstretched arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to quench upon his breast that voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May God so father me, as I do him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so forsake me, as I let him feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's orphaned haply. Here I take the child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To share my cup, to slumber on my knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To play his loudest gambol at my foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold my finger in the public ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till none shall need inquire 'Whose child is this?'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gesture saying so tenderly 'My own.'"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood a moment silent in her place;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then turning toward me very slow and cold:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And you, what say you? will you blame me much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, careful for that outcast child of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I catch this hand that's stretched to me and him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor dare to leave him friendless in the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where men have stoned me? Have I not the right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take so mere an aftermath from life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else found so wholly bare? Or is it wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let your cousin, for a generous bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put out his ungloved fingers among briars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set a tumbling bird's nest somewhat straight?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not tell him, though we're innocent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not harmless, . . . and that both our harms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will stick to his good, smooth, noble life like burrs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never to drop off though he shakes the cloak?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've been my friend: you will not now be his?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've known him that he's worthy of a friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you're his cousin, lady, after all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore more than free to take his part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explaining, since the nest is surely spoilt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Marian what you know her though a wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world would hardly understand her case
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of being just hurt and honest; while, for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould ever twit him with his bastard child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And married harlot. Speak, while yet there's time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would not stand and let a good man's dog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn round and rend him, because his, and reared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a generous breed, and will you let his act,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it's generous? Speak. I'm bound to you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll be bound by only you, in this."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrilling, solemn voice, so passionless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustained, yet low, without a rise or fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who had authority to speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not as Marian.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked up to feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If God stood near me, and beheld His heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As blue as Aaron's priestly robe appeared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Aaron when he took it off to die.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I spoke: "Accept the gift, I say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sister Marian, and be satisfied.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand that gives has still a soul behind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which will not let it quail for having given,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though foolish worldlings talk they know not what
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what they know not. Romney's strong enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this: do you be strong to know he's strong:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stands on Right's side; never flinch for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he stood on the other. You'll be bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By me? I am a woman of repute;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fly-blow gossip ever specked my life;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is clean and open as this hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose glove there's not a man dares blab about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he had touched it freely. Here's my hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clasp your hand, my Marian, owned as pure!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pure as I'm a woman and a Leigh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as I'm both, I'll witness to the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Romney Leigh is honoured in his choice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who chooses Marian for his honoured wife."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her broad wild woodland eyes shot out a light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her smile was wonderful for rapture. "Thanks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My great Aurora." Forward then she sprang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropping her impassioned spaniel head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its brown abandonment of curls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Romney's feet, we heard the kisses drawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sobs upon the foot, upon the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Romney! O my angel! O unchanged,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though since we've parted I have passed the grave!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Death itself could only better thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not change thee! Thee I do not thank at all:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I but thank God who made thee what thou art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wholly godlike."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he tried in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise her to his embrace, escaping thence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any leaping fawn from a huntsman's grasp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bounded off and 'lighted beyond reach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before him, with a staglike majesty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of soft, serene defiance, as she knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not touch her, so was tolerant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had cared to try. She stood there with her great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drowned eyes, and dripping cheeks, and strange, sweet smile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lived through all, as if one held a light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across a waste of waters shook her head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep some thoughts down deeper in her soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, white and tranquil like a summer-cloud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, having rained itself to a tardy peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands still in heaven as if it ruled the day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoke out again, "Although, my generous friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last we met and parted you're unchanged,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having promised faith to Marian Erle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain it, as she were not changed at all;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though that's worthy, though that's full of balm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any conscious spirit of a girl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who once has loved you as I loved you once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still it will not make her . . . if she's dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gone away where none can give or take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In marriage able to revive, return
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wed you will it, Romney? Here's the point,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend, we'll see it plainer: you and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must never, never, never join hands so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, let me say it for I said it first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To God, and placed it, rounded to an oath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far, far above the moon there, at His feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As surely as I wept just now at yours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never, never, never join hands so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, be patient with me; do not think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm speaking from a false humility.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is, I am grown so proud with grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And He has said so often through His nights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through His mornings, 'Weep a little still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thou foolish Marian, because women must,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But do not blush at all except for sin'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I, who felt myself unworthy once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of virtuous Romney and his high-born race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have come to learn, a woman, poor or rich,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despised or honoured, is a human soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what her soul is, that she is herself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she should be spit upon of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the pavement of the churches here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still good enough to pray in. And being chaste
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And honest, and inclined to do the right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love the truth, and live my life out green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smooth beneath his steps, I should not fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make him thus a less uneasy time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than many a happier woman. Very proud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see me. Pardon, that I set a trap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear a confirmation in your voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both yours and yours. It is so good to know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas really God who said the same before;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus it is in heaven, that first God speaks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then His angels. Oh, it does me good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wipes me clean and sweet from devil's dirt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Romney Leigh should think me worthy still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of being his true and honourable wife!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth I need not say, on leaving earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no glory in it. For the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason's ready (master, angel, friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be patient with me) wherefore you and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can never, never, never join hands so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you'll not be angry like a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For you are none) when I shall tell the truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is, I do not love you, Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not love you. Ah well! catch my hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Leigh, and burn into my eyes with yours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear I do not love him. Did I once?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis said that women have been bruised to death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, if once they loved, that love of theirs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could never be drained out with all their blood:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've heard such things and pondered. Did I indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love once; or did I only worship? Yes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, O friend, I set you up so high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all actual good or hope of good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or fear of evil, all that could be mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haply set you above love itself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of reach of these poor woman's arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angelic Romney. What was in my thought?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be your slave, your help, your toy, your tool.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be your love . . . I never thought of that:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give you love . . . still less. I gave you love?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I did not give you anything;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was but only yours upon my knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All yours, in soul and body, in head and heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature you had taken from the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still crumbling through your fingers to your feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To join the dust she came from. Did I love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or did I worship? judge, Aurora Leigh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if indeed I loved, 'twas long ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long! before the sun and moon were made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the hells were open, ah, before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard my child cry in the desert night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knew he had no father. It may be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not as strong as other women are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, torn and crushed, are not undone from love:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be I am colder than the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, being dead, love always. But for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once killed, this ghost of Marian loves no more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more . . . except the child! . . . no more at all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told your cousin, sir, that I was dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, she thinks I'll get up from my grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wear my chin-cloth for a wedding-veil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And glide along the churchyard like a bride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all the dead keep whispering through the withes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You would be better in your place with us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You pitiful corruption!' At the thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damps break out on me like leprosy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I'm clean. Ay, clean as Marian Erle!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Marian Leigh, I know, I were not clean:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor have I so much life that I should love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except the child. Ah God! I could not bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see my darling on a good man's knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know, by such a look, or such a sigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or such a silence, that he thought sometimes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This child was fathered by some cursèd wretch' . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, Romney, angels are less tender-wise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than God and mothers: even you would think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we think never. He is ours, the child;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we would sooner vex a soul in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By coupling with it the dead body's thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It left behind it in a last month's grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than, in my child, see other than . . . my child.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only never call him fatherless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has God and his mother. O my babe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pretty, pretty blossom, an ill wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once blew upon my breast! can any think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd have another one called happier,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fathered child, with father's love and race
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's worn as bold and open as a smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To vex my darling when he's asked his name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has no answer? What! a happier child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than mine, my best who laughed so loud to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not sleep for pastime? Nay, I swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By life and love, that, if I lived like some,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loved like . . . some, ay, loved you, Romney Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some love (eyes that have wept so much, see clear),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've room for no more children in my arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My kisses are all melted on one mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not push my darling to a stool
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dandle babies. Here's a hand shall keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever clean without a marriage-ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tend my boy until he cease to need
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One steadying finger of it, and desert
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Not miss) his mother's lap, to sit with men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I miss him (not he me), I'll come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And say 'Now give me some of Romney's work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help your outcast orphans of the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And comfort grief with grief.' For you, meantime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most noble Romney, wed a noble wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And open on each other your great souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not farther bless you. If I dared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But strain and touch her in her upper sphere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And say 'Come down to Romney pay my debt!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be joyful with the stream of joy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent through me. But the moon is in my face . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare not though I guess the name he loves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm learned with my studies of old days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering how he crushed his under-lip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some one came and spoke, or did not come.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora, I could touch her with my hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fly because I dare not."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was gone.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled so sternly that I spoke in haste.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forgive her she sees clearly for herself:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her instinct's holy."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I forgive!" he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only marvel how she sees so sure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While others" . . . there he paused then hoarse, abrupt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora! you forgive us, her and me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, the thing she sees, poor, loyal child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If once corrected by the thing I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been unspoken, since she loves you well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has leave to love you: while for me, alas!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If once or twice I let my heart escape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, . . . remember, where hearts slip and fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They break beside: we're parting parting ah!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not love, that you should surely know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that word means. Forgive, be tolerant:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had not been, but that I felt myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So safe in impuissance and despair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not hurt you though I tossed my arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sighed my soul out. The most utter wretch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will choose his postures when he comes to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However in the presence of a queen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you'll forgive me some unseemly spasms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which meant no more than dying. Do you think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had ever come here in my perfect mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless I had come here in my settled mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound Marian's, bound to keep the bond and give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name, my house, my hand, the things I could,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Marian? For even I could give as much:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even I, affronting her exalted soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a supposition that she wanted these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could act the husband's coat and hat set up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To creak i' the wind and drive the world-crows off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From pecking in her garden. Straw can fill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hole to keep out vermin. Now, at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I own heaven's angels round her life suffice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight the rats of our society
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without this Romney: I can see it at last;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is ended my pretension which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most pretended. Over-proud of course,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so! but not so stupid . . . blind . . . that I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom thus the great Taskmaster of the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has set to meditate mistaken work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dreary face against a dim blank wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout man's natural lifetime could pretend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wish . . . O love, I have loved you! O my soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lost you! but I swear by all yourself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all you might have been to me these years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that June morning had not failed my hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not so bestial, to regret that day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night this night, which still to you is fair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, not so blind, Aurora. I attest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those stars above us which I cannot see". .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You cannot" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That if Heaven itself should stoop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-mix the lots, and give me another chance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd say 'No other!' I'd record my blank.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora never should be wife of mine."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not see the stars?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis worse still, not to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find your hand, although we're parting, dear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment let me hold it ere we part;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And understand my last words these, at last!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have you thinking when I'm gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Romney dared to hanker for your love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thought or vision, if attainable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Which certainly for me it never was),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wished to use it for a dog to-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the blind man stumbling. God forbid!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I know He held you in His palm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kept you open-eyed to all my faults,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save you at last from such a dreary end.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe me, dear, that, if I had known like Him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What loss was coming on me, I had done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well in this as He has. Farewell, you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are still my light, farewell! How late it is:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that, now. You've been too patient, sweet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will but blow my whistle toward the lane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some one comes the same who brought me here.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get in Good-night."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A moment. Heavenly Christ!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment. Speak once, Romney. 'Tis not true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold your hands, I look into your face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see me?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more than the blessèd stars.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be blessèd too, Aurora. Nay, my sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You tremble. Tender-hearted! Do you mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of yore, dear, how you used to cheat old John,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the mice out slyly from his traps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he marvelled at the soul in mice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which took the cheese and left the snare? The same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear soft heart always! 'Twas for this I grieved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe's letter never reached you. Ah, you had heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of illness not the issue, not the extent:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life, long sick with tossings up and down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden revulsion in the blazing house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strain and struggle both of body and soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which left fire running in my veins for blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce lacked that thunderbolt of the falling beam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which nicked me on the forehead as I passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gallery-door with a burden. Say heaven's bolt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not William Erle's, not Marian's father's, tramp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poacher, whom I found for what he was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, eager for her sake to rescue him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth swept from the open highway of the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road-dust and all till, like a woodland boar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most naturally unwilling to be tamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He notched me with his tooth. But not a word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Marian! and I do not think, besides,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned the tilting of the beam my way;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if he laughed, as many swear, poor wretch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor he, nor I supposed the hurt so deep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll hope his next laugh may be merrier,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a better cause."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blind, Romney?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, my friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll learn to say it in a cheerful voice;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, at first desponded. To be blind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned out of nature, mulcted as a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refused the daily largesse of the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To humble creatures! When the fever's heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropped from me, as the flame did from my house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left me ruined like it, stripped of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hues and shapes of aspectable life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mere bare blind stone in the blaze of day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man, upon the outside of the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dark as ten feet under, in the grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, that seemed hard."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No hope?"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A tear! you weep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine Aurora? tears upon my hand!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen you weeping for a mouse, a bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, weep for me, Aurora? Yes, there's hope.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not hope of sight, I could be learned, dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell you in what Greek and Latin name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visual nerve is withered to the root,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the outer eyes appear indifferent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspotted in their crystals. But there's hope.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit, from behind this dethroned sense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees, waits in patience till the walls break up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which the bas-relief and fresco have dropped:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's hope. The man here, once so arrogant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And restless, so ambitious, for his part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dealing with statistically packed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disorders (from a pattern on his nail),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And packing such things quite another way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is now contented. From his personal loss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has come to hope for others when they lose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wear a gladder faith in what we gain . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through bitter experience, compensation sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like that tear, sweetest. I am quiet now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tender surely for the suffering world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But quiet, sitting at the wall to learn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content henceforth to do the thing I can:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, though as powerless, said I, as a stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stone can still give shelter to a worm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is worth while being a stone for that:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's hope, Aurora."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there hope for me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me? and is there room beneath the stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a worm? And if I came and said . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What all this weeping scarce will let me say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet what women cannot say at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But weeping bitterly . . . (the pride keeps up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the heart breaks under it) . . . I love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love you, Romney" . . .


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silence!" he exclaimed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A woman's pity sometimes makes her mad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man's distraction must not cheat his soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take advantage of it. Yet, 'tis hard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, Aurora."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I love you, sir;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when a woman says she loves a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man must hear her, though he love her not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which . . . hush! . . . he has leave to answer in his turn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will not surely blame him. As for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You call it pity, think I'm generous?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twere somewhat easier, for a woman proud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I am, and I'm very vilely proud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let it pass as such, and press on you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love born of pity, seeing that excellent loves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are born so, often, nor the quicklier die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this would set me higher by the head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than now I stand. No matter: let the truth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand high; Aurora must be humble: no,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love's not pity merely. Obviously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not a generous woman, never was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else, of old, I had not looked so near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To weights and measures, grudging you the power
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give, as first I scorned your power to judge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, Aurora. I would have no gifts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forsooth, but God's, and I would use them too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my pleasure and my choice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As He and I were equals, you below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluded from that level of interchange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admitting benefaction. You were wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In much? you said so. I was wrong in most.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, most! You only thought to rescue men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By half-means, half-way, seeing half their wants,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While thinking nothing of your personal gain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I, who saw the human nature broad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At both sides, comprehending too the soul's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the high necessities of Art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betrayed the thing I saw, and wronged my own life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For which I pleaded. Passioned to exalt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artist's instinct in me at the cost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of putting down the woman's, I forgot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No perfect artist is developed here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From any imperfect woman. Flower from root,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spiritual from natural, grade by grade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all our life. A handful of the earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make God's image! the despised poor earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The healthy, odorous earth, I missed with it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divine Breath that blows the nostrils out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ineffable inflatus, ay, the breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which love is. Art is much, but Love is more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Art, my Art, thou'rt much, but Love is more!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art symbolises heaven, but Love is God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes heaven. I, Aurora, fell from mine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not be a woman like the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple woman who believes in love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And owns the right of love because she loves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, hearing she's beloved, is satisfied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what contents God: I must analyse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confront, and question; just as if a fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refused to warm itself in any sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till such was in Leone: I must fret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forsooth, because the month was only May,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be faithless of the kind of proffered love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And captious, lest it miss my dignity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scornful, that my lover sought a wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use . . . to use! O Romney, O my love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am changed since then, changed wholly, for indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If now you'd stoop so low to take my love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And use it roughly, without stint or spare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men use common things with more behind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And, in this, ever would be more behind)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To any mean and ordinary end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy would set me like a star, in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So high up, I should shine because of height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not of virtue. Yet in one respect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one, beloved, I am in nowise changed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love you, loved you . . . loved you first and last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love you on for ever. Now I know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I loved you always, Romney. She who died
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew that, and said so; Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows that; . . . and Marian. I had known the same,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except that I was prouder than I knew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not so honest. Ay, and, as I live,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have died so, crushing in my hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rose of love, the wasp inside and all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring ever to my soul and you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both rose and pain except for this great loss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great despair to stand before your face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know you do not see me where I stand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think, perhaps, I am not changed from pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that I chiefly bear to say such words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you cannot shame me with your eyes?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O calm, grand eyes, extinguished in a storm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown out like lights o'er melancholy seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though shrieked for by the shipwrecked, O my Dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Cloud, to go before me every day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I go ever toward the wilderness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would that you could see me bare to the soul!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this be pity, 'tis so for myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not for Romney! he can stand alone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man like him is never overcome:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No woman like me counts him pitiable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While saints applaud him. He mistook the world;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I mistook my own heart, and that slip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fatal. Romney, will you leave me here?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wrong, so proud, so weak, so unconsoled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So mere a woman! and I love you so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love you, Romney "


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I see his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wept so? Did I drop against his breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or did his arms constrain me? were my cheeks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot, overflooded, with my tears or his?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And which of our two large explosive hearts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So shook me? That, I know not. There were words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That broke in utterance . . . melted, in the fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embrace, that was convulsion, . . . then a kiss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long and silent as the ecstatic night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deep, deep, shuddering breaths, which meant beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever could be told by word or kiss.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he said . . . I have written day by day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With somewhat even writing. Did I think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such a passionate rain would intercept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dash this last page? What he said, indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fain would write it down here like the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep it in my eyes, as in my ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart's sweet scripture, to be read at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When weary, or at morning when afraid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lean my heaviest oath on when I swear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, when all's done, all tried, all counted here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All great arts, and all good philosophies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This love just puts its hand out in a dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight outstretches all things.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fain would write. But if an angel spoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thunder, should we haply know much more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than that it thundered? If a cloud came down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrapped us wholly, could we draw its shape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if on the outside and not overcome?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so he spake. His breath against my face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confused his words, yet made them more intense
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As when the sudden finger of the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will wipe a row of single city-lamps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a pure white line of flame, more luminous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of obliteration), more intense,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intimate presence carrying in itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete communication, as with souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, having put the body off, perceive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through simply being. Thus, 'twas granted me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know he loved me to the depth and height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such large natures, ever competent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With grand horizons by the sea or land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To love's grand sunrise. Small spheres hold small fires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he loved largely, as a man can love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, baffled in his love, dares live his life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accept the ends which God loves, for his own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lift a constant aspect.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought to England my poor searching face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(An orphan even of my father's grave),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had loved me, watched me, watched his soul in mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which in me grew and heightened into love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he, a boy still, had been told the tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of how a fairy bride from Italy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With smells of oleanders in her hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was coming through the vines to touch his hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat the blood of boyhood on the palm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made sudden heats. And when at last I came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lived before him lived, and rarely smiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and loved me for the thing I was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As every child will love the year's first flower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Not certainly the fairest of the year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in which, the complete year seems to blow),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor sad snowdrop, growing between drifts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious medium 'twixt the plant and frost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So faint with winter while so quick with spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And doubtful if to thaw itself away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that snow near it. Not that Romney Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had loved me coldly. If I thought so once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as if I had held my hand in fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook for cold. But now I understood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever, that the very fire and heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of troubling passion in him burned him clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shaped, to dubious order, word and act:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, just because he loved me over all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All wealth, all lands, all social privilege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which chance made him unexpected heir,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, just because on all these lesser gifts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constrained by conscience and the sense of wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had stamped with steady hand God's arrow-mark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dedication to the human need,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it should be so too, with his love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, passionately loving, would bring down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His love, his life, his best (because the best),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bride of dreams, who walked so still and high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through flowery poems as through meadow-grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust of golden lilies on her feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she should walk beside him on the rocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all that clang and hewing out of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And help the work of help which was his life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prove he kept back nothing, not his soul.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I failed him, for I failed him, I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when it seemed he had missed my love, he thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aurora makes room for a working-noon,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, self-girded with torn strips of hope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took up his life as if it were for death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Just capable of one heroic aim),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threw it in the thickest of the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which men laughed as if he had drowned a dog.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder, since Aurora failed him first!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning and the evening made his day.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh, the night! oh, bitter-sweet! oh, sweet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O dark, O moon and stars, O ecstasy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of darkness! O great mystery of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which absorbed, loss, anguish, treason's self
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enlarges rapture, as a pebble dropped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some full wine-cup overbrims the wine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we two sat together, leaned that night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So close my very garments crept and thrilled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With strange electric life, and both my cheeks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew red, then pale, with touches from my hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which his breath was, while the golden moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hung before our faces as the badge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some sublime inherited despair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since ever to be seen by only one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice said, low and rapid as a sigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet breaking, I felt conscious, from a smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank God, who made me blind, to make me see!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shine on, Aurora, dearest light of souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which rul'st for evermore both day and night!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I flung closer to his breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sword that, after battle, flings to sheath;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in that hurtle of united souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystic motions which in common moods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are shut beyond our sense, broke in on us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as we sat, we felt the old earth spin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the starry turbulence of worlds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swing round us in their audient circles, till,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that same golden moon were overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if beneath our feet, we did not know.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then calm, equal, smooth with weights of joy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice rose, as some chief musician's song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the old Jewish temple's Selah-pause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade me mark how we two met at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon this moon-bathed promontory of earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give up much on each side, then take all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beloved," it sang, "we must be here to work;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men who work can only work for men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, not to work in vain, must comprehend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity and so work humanly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And raise men's bodies still by raising souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As God did first."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But stand upon the earth,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "to raise them (this is human too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's nothing high which has not first been low;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My humbleness, said One, has made me great!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As God did last."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And work all silently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And simply," he returned, "as God does all;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distort our nature never for our work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor count our right hands stronger for being hoofs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man most man, with tenderest human hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works best for men, as God in Nazareth."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused upon the word, and then resumed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fewer programmes, we who have no pre-science.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fewer systems, we who are held and do not hold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less mapping out of masses to be saved,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By nations or by sexes. Fourier's void,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Comte absurd, and Cabet puerile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsist no rules of life outside of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No perfect manners without Christian souls:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christ Himself had been no Lawgiver
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless He had given the life, too, with the law."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I echoed thoughtfully: "The man, most man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works best for men, and, if most man indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gets his manhood plainest from his soul:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While obviously this stringent soul itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obeys the old law of development,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit ever witnessing in ours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love, the soul of soul, within the soul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolving it sublimely. First, God's love."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And next," he smiled, "the love of wedded souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which still presents that mystery's counterpart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet shadow-rose, upon the water of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such a mystic substance, Sharon gave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A name to! human, vital, fructuous rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose calyx holds the multitude of leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loves filial, loves fraternal, neighbour-loves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And civic all fair petals, all good scents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All reddened, sweetened from one central Heart!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas," I cried, "it was not long ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You swore this very social rose smelt ill."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas," he answered, "is it a rose at all?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filial's thankless, the fraternal's hard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is lost. I do but stand and think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the waters of a troubled life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Flower of Heaven so vainly overhangs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What perfect counterpart would be in sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If tanks were clearer. Let us clean the tubes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wait for rains. O poet, O my love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was too ambitious in my deed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought to distance all men in success
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Till God came on me, marked the place, and said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ill-doer, henceforth keep within this line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempting less than others,' and I stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And work among Christ's little ones, content),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come thou, my compensation, my dear sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My morning-star, my morning, rise and shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch my hills with radiance not their own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shine out for two, Aurora, and fulfil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My falling-short that must be! work for two,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I, though thus restrained, for two, shall love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaze on, with inscient vision toward the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, from his visceral heat, pluck out the roots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of light beyond him. Art's a service, mark:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver key is given to thy clasp,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou shalt stand unwearied, night and day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fix it in the hard, slow-turning wards,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open, so, that intermediate door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt the different planes of sensuous form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And form insensuous, that inferior men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May learn to feel on still through these to those,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bless thy ministration. The world waits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For help. Beloved, let us love so well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work shall still be better for our love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still our love be sweeter for our work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And both commended, for the sake of each,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all true workers and true lovers born.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now press the clarion on thy woman's lip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Love's holy kiss shall still keep consecrate)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathe thy fine keen breath along the brass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blow all class-walls level as Jericho's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past Jordan, crying from the top of souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To souls, that, here assembled on earth's flats,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They get them to some purer eminence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any hitherto beheld for clouds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What height we know not, but the way we know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how by mounting ever we attain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so climb on. It is the hour for souls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bodies, leavened by the will and love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be lightened to redemption. The world's old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the old world waits the time to be renewed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward which, new hearts in individual growth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must quicken, and increase to multitude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In new dynasties of the race of men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed whence, shall grow spontaneously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New churches, new oeconomies, new laws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admitting freedom, new societies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding falsehood: He shall make all new."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Romney! Lifting up my hand in his,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wheeled by Seeing spirits toward the east,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned instinctively, where, faint and far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the tingling desert of the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the circle of the conscious hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were laid in jasper-stone as clear as glass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first foundations of that new, near Day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which should be builded out of heaven to God.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood a moment with erected brows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, as a creature might who gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood calm, and fed his blind, majestic eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the thought of perfect noon: and when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw his soul saw, "Jasper first," I said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And second, sapphire; third, chalcedony;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest in order: last, an amethyst."

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers drawn from the ends of the earth, jewelled and plumed were we;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was Lord of the Inca race, and she was Queen of the Sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the stars beyond our stars where the new-forged meteors glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotly we stormed Valhalla, a million years ago!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever Â’neath high Valhalla Hall the well-tuned horns begin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the swords are out in the underworld, and the weary Gods come in.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever through high Valhalla Gate the Patient Angel goes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opens the eyes that are blind with hate, he joins the hands of foes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust of the stars was under our feet, glitter of stars above,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrecks of our wrath dropped reeling down as we fought and we spurned and we strove.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worlds upon worlds we tossed aside, and scattered them to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night that we stormed Valhalla, a million years ago!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are forgiven as they forgive all those dark wounds and deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their beds are made on the Lap of Time and they lie down and sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are forgiven as they forgive all those old wounds that bleed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shut their eyes from their worshippers; they sleep till the world has need.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She with the star I had marked for my own, I with my set desire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in the loom of the Night of Nights, lighted by worlds afire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met in a war against the Gods where the headlong meteors glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hewing our way to Valhalla, a million years ago!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will come back, come back again, as long as the red Earth rolls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never wasted a leaf or a tree. Do you think He would squander souls ?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hung with bloom along the bough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stands about the woodland ride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing white for Eastertide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, of my threescore years and ten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty will not come again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take from seventy springs a score,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only leaves me fifty more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since to look at things in bloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty springs are little room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the woodlands I will go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the cherry hung with snow.

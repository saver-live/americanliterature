<p> Sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the forest.<br> O child, do not go out!<br> The palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads against the dismal sky; the crows with their draggled wings are silent on the tamarind branches, and the eastern bank of the river is haunted by a deepening gloom.<br> Our cow is lowing loud, tied at the fence.<br> O child, wait here till I bring her into the stall.<br> Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rain water is running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who has run away from his mother to tease her.<br> Listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford.<br> O child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry is closed.<br> The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly-rushing rain; the water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers.<br> The evening lamps must be made ready.<br> O child, do not go out!<br> The road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is slippery. The wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo branches like a wild beast tangled in a net.</p>

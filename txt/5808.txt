<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Autumn night, in Sudbury town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the meadows bare and brown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows of the wayside inn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed red with fire-light through the leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of woodbine, hanging from the eaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their crimson curtains rent and thin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ancient is this hostelry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any in the land may be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built in the old Colonial day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When men lived in a grander way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ampler hospitality;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now somewhat fallen to decay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With weather-stains upon the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stairways worn, and crazy doors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And creaking and uneven floors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chimneys huge, and tiled and tall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A region of repose it seems,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place of slumber and of dreams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote among the wooded hills!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there no noisy railway speeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its torch-race scattering smoke and gleeds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But noon and night, the panting teams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop under the great oaks, that throw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangles of light and shade below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On roofs and doors and window-sills.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the road the barns display
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lines of stalls, their mows of hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the wide doors the breezes blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wattled cocks strut to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, half effaced by rain and shine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Horse prances on the sign.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round this old-fashioned, quaint abode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep silence reigned, save when a gust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went rushing down the county road,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And skeletons of leaves, and dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment quickened by its breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuddered and danced their dance of death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the ancient oaks o'erhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mysterious voices moaned and fled.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the parlor of the inn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasant murmur smote the ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like water rushing through a weir:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft interrupted by the din
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of laughter and of loud applause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in each intervening pause,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music of a violin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire-light, shedding over all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendor of its ruddy glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the whole parlor large and low;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gleamed on wainscot and on wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It touched with more than wonted grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Princess Mary's pictured face;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bronzed the rafters overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the old spinet's ivory keys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It played inaudible melodies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It crowned the sombre clock with flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands, the hours, the maker's name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And painted with a livelier red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Landlord's coat-of-arms again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, flashing on the window-pane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emblazoned with its light and shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jovial rhymes, that still remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ near a century ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the great Major Molineaux,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom Hawthorne has immortal made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the blazing fire of wood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erect the rapt musician stood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever and anon he bent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head upon his instrument,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seemed to listen, till he caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confessions of its secret thought,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy, the triumph, the lament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exultation and the pain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, by the magic of his art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He soothed the throbbings of its heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lulled it into peace again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the fireside at their ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There sat a group of friends, entranced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the delicious melodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from the far-off noisy town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had to the wayside inn come down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rest beneath its old oak-trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire-light on their faces glanced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadows on the wainscot danced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, though of different lands and speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each had his tale to tell, and each
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was anxious to be pleased and please.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while the sweet musician plays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me in outline sketch them all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance uncouthly as the blaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its uncertain touch portrays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadowy semblance on the wall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first the Landlord will I trace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grave in his aspect and attire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of ancient pedigree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Justice of the Peace was he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known in all Sudbury as "The Squire."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud was he of his name and race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of old Sir William and Sir Hugh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the parlor, full in view,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His coat-of-arms, well framed and glazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the wall in colors blazed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beareth gules upon his shield,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chevron argent in the field,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With three wolf's heads, and for the crest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Wyvern part-per-pale addressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a helmet barred; below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scroll reads, "By the name of Howe."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over this, no longer bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though glimmering with a latent light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hung the sword his grandsire bore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rebellious days of yore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down there at Concord in the fight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth was there, of quiet ways,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Student of old books and days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom all tongues and lands were known
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet a lover of his own;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a social virtue graced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet a friend of solitude;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of such a genial mood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of all things he embraced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet of such fastidious taste,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never found the best too good.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Books were his passion and delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his upper room at home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood many a rare and sumptuous tome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vellum bound, with gold bedight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great volumes garmented in white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling Florence, Pisa, Rome.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved the twilight that surrounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The border-land of old romance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where glitter hauberk, helm, and lance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And banner waves, and trumpet sounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ladies ride with hawk on wrist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mighty warriors sweep along,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magnified by the purple mist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dusk of centuries and of song.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chronicles of Charlemagne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Merlin and the Mort d'Arthure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled together in his brain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tales of Flores and Blanchefleur,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Ferumbras, Sir Eglamour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Launcelot, Sir Morgadour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Guy, Sir Bevis, Sir Gawain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young Sicilian, too, was there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sight of Etna born and bred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some breath of its volcanic air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was glowing in his heart and brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, being rebellious to his liege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Palermo's fatal siege,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the western seas he fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In good King Bomba's happy reign.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face was like a summer night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All flooded with a dusky light;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands were small; his teeth shone white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sea-shells, when he smiled or spoke;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sinews supple and strong as oak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean shaven was he as a priest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who at the mass on Sunday sings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save that upon his upper lip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beard, a good palm's length least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level and pointed at the tip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot sideways, like a swallow's wings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poets read he o'er and o'er,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most of all the Immortal Four
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Italy; and next to those,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story-telling bard of prose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wrote the joyous Tuscan tales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Decameron, that make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiesole's green hills and vales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembered for Boccaccio's sake.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much too of music was his thought;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodies and measures fraught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sunshine and the open air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of vineyards and the singing sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his beloved Sicily;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And much it pleased him to peruse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The songs of the Sicilian muse,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucolic songs by Meli sung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the familiar peasant tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made men say, "Behold! once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pitying gods to earth restore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theocritus of Syracuse!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Spanish Jew from Alicant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With aspect grand and grave was there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vender of silks and fabrics rare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And attar of rose from the Levant.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an old Patriarch he appeared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham or Isaac, or at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some later Prophet or High-Priest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lustrous eyes, and olive skin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, wildly tossed from cheeks and chin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumbling cataract of his beard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His garments breathed a spicy scent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cinnamon and sandal blent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the soft aromatic gales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That meet the mariner, who sails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Moluccas, and the seas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wash the shores of Celebes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stories that recorded are
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Pierre Alphonse he knew by heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was rumored he could say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parables of Sandabar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the Fables of Pilpay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if not all, the greater part!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well versed was he in Hebrew books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talmud and Targum, and the lore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Kabala; and evermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a mystery in his looks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes seemed gazing far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if in vision or in trance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the solemn sackbut play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the Jewish maidens dance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Theologian, from the school
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Cambridge on the Charles, was there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skilful alike with tongue and pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He preached to all men everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gospel of the Golden Rule,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Commandment given to men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking the deed, and not the creed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would help us in our utmost need.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reverent feet the earth he trod,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor banished nature from his plan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But studied still with deep research
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build the Universal Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lofty as in the love of God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ample as the wants of man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Poet, too, was there, whose verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was tender, musical, and terse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspiration, the delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gleam, the glory, the swift flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thoughts so sudden, that they seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revelations of a dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these were his; but with them came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No envy of another's fame;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not find his sleep less sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For music in some neighboring street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor rustling hear in every breeze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laurels of Miltiades.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honor and blessings on his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While living, good report when dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, not too eager for renown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepts, but does not clutch, the crown!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last the Musician, as he stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illumined by that fire of wood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair-haired, blue-eyed, his aspect blithe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure tall and straight and lithe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every feature of his face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revealing his Norwegian race;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A radiance, streaming from within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around his eyes and forehead beamed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Angel with the violin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted by Raphael, he seemed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived in that ideal world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose language is not speech, but song;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around him evermore the throng
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of elves and sprites their dances whirled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stromkarl sang, the cataract hurled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its headlong waters from the height;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mingled in the wild delight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of sea-birds in their flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumor of the forest trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plunge of the implacable seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumult of the wind at night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of eld, like trumpets blowing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old ballads, and wild melodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through mist and darkness pouring forth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Elivagar's river flowing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the glaciers of the North.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instrument on which he played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was in Cremona's workshops made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a great master of the past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere yet was lost the art divine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashioned of maple and of pine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in Tyrolian forests vast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had rocked and wrestled with the blast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exquisite was it in design,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect in each minutest part.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marvel of the lutist's art;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in its hollow chamber, thus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maker from whose hands it came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had written his unrivalled name,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Antonius Stradivarius."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he played, the atmosphere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was filled with magic, and the ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught echoes of that Harp of Gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose music had so weird a sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunted stag forgot to bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaping rivulet backward rolled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birds came down from bush and tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead came from beneath the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maiden to the harper's knee!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music ceased; the applause was loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleased musician smiled and bowed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood-fire clapped its hands of flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows on the wainscot stirred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the harpsichord there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ghostly murmur of acclaim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound like that sent down at night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By birds of passage in their flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the remotest distance heard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then silence followed; then began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clamor for the Landlord's tale,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story promised them of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said, but always left untold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, although a bashful man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his courage seemed to fail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding excuse of no avail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yielded; and thus the story ran.

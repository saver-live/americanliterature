<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, show me how a rose can shut and be a bud again!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, watch my Lords of the Admiralty, for they have the work in train.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have taken the men that were careless lads at Dartmouth in Fourteen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And entered them at the landward schools as though no war had been.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have piped the children off all the seas from the Falklands to the Bight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quartered them on the Colleges to learn to read and write!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their books were rain and sleet and fog, the dry gale and the snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their teachers were the horned mines and the hump-backed Death below.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their schools were walled by the walking mist and roofed by the waiting skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they conned their task in a new-sown field with the Moonlight Sacrifice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were not rated too young to teach, nor reckoned unfit to guide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they formed their class on Helles beach at the bows of the River Clyde.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their eyes are sunk by endless watch, their faces roughed by the spray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their feet are drawn by the wet sea-boots they changed not night or day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they guarded the six-knot convoys flank on the road to Norroway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ears are stuffed with the week-long roar of the West-Atlantic gale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sloops were watching the Irish Shore from Galway to Kinsale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hands are scored where the life-lines cut or the dripping funnel-stays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they followed their leader at thirty knot between the Skaw and the Naze.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mouths are filled with the magic words they learned at the colliers hatch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they coaled in the foul December dawns and sailed in the forenoon-watch;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or measured the weight of a Pentland tide and the wind off Ronaldshay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the target mastered the breathless tug and the hawser carried away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know the price to be paid for a fault, for a gauge-clock wrongly read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a picket-boat to the gangway brought bows-on and fullahead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the drowsy seconds lack of thought that costs a dozen dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have touched a knowledge outreaching speech, as when the cutters were sent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To harvest the dreadful mile of beach after the Vanguard went.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have learned great faith and little fear and a high heart in distress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how to suffer each sodden year of heaped-up weariness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have borne the bridle upon their lips and the yoke upon their neck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since they went down to the sea in ships to save the world from wreck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the chests were slung down the College stair at Dartmouth in Fourteen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now they are quit of the sea-affair as though no war had been.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far have they steamed and much have they known, and most would they fain forget;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now they are come to their joyous own with all the world in their debt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft, blow soft on them, little East Wind! Be smooth for them, mighty stream!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the cams they use are not of your kind, and they bump, for choice, by steam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightly dance with them, Newnham maid, but none too lightly believe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are hot from the fifty-month blockade, and they carry their hearts on their sleeve.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenderly, Proctor, let them down, if they do not walk as they should:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, by God, if they owe you half a crown, you owe em your four years food!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallowed River, most gracious Trees, Chapel beyond compare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here be gentlemen sick of the seas, take them into your care.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far have they come, much have they braved. Give them their hour of play,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the hidden things their hands have saved work for them day by day:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the grateful Past their youth redeemed return them their youth once more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Soul of the Child at last lets fall the unjust load that it bore

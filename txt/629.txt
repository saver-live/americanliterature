<p>I take my wine jug out among the flowers<br> to drink alone, without friends.<br> <br> I raise my cup to entice the moon.<br> That, and my shadow, makes us three.<br> <br> But the moon doesn't drink,<br> and my shadow silently follows.<br> <br> I will travel with moon and shadow,<br> happy to the end of spring.<br> <br> When I sing, the moon dances.<br> When I dance, my shadow dances, too.<br> <br> We share life's joys when sober.<br> Drunk, each goes a separate way.<br> <br> Constant friends, although we wander,<br> we'll meet again in the Milky Way.<br></p>

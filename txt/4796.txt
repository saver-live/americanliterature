<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again the Steamer at Calais, the tackles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easing the car-trays on to the quay. Release her!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign-refill, and let me away with my horses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Seventy Thundering Horses!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow through the traffic, my horses! It is enough, it is France

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the throat-closing brick fields by Lille, or her pavées
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endlessly ending in rain between beet and tobacco;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that wind we shave by, the brutal North-Easter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasping the newly dunged Somme.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Into your collars, my horses!) It is enough, it is France!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the dappled Argonne, the cloud-shadows packing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either horizon with ghosts; or exquisite, carven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Villages hewn from the cliff, the torrents behind them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeding their never-quenched lights.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Look to your footing, my horses!) It is enough, it is France!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether that gale where Biscay jammed in the corner
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herds and heads her seas at the Landes, but defeated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellowing smokes along Spain, till the uttermost headlands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make themselves dance in the mist.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Breathe, breathe deeply, my horses!) It is enough, it is France!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the broken, honey-hued, honey-combed limestone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cream under white-hot sun; the rosemary bee-bloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleepily noisy at noon and, somewhere to Southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleepily noisy, the Sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Tes, it is warm here, my horses!) It is enough, it is France

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Massif in Spring, the multiplied lacets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hampered by slips or drifts; the gentians, under
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turbaned snow, pushing up the heaven of Summer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the stark moors lie black.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Neigh through the icicled tunnels;) It is enough, it is France!

<p><cite class="al-title">Science in the Kitchen</cite> is a self-described scientific treatise on food substances and their dietetic properties, together with a practical explanation of the principles of healthful cookery, and a large number of original, palatable, and wholesome recipes developed by Mrs. E.E. Kellogg, A.M. Her book offers the most extensive table of contents for food preparation techniques and recipes I've ever seen (other than Julia Child), ranging from a gourmet dish to oatmeal gruel prepared for a sick hospital patient.</p><p>Featured in our collection, <a href="/foodie-stories#foodie-books">Foodie Books &amp; Wartime Recipes</a></p><p><a href="preface">Preface</a></p><p><a href="introduction">Introduction</a></p><p><a href="food">Food</a></p><p><a href="table-topics">Table Topics</a></p><p><a href="the-digestion-of-foods">The Digestion of Foods</a></p><p><a href="cookery">Cookery</a></p><p><a href="more-from-mrs-kellogg-coming-soon">More from Mrs. Kellogg, coming soon!</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/mrs-ee-kellogg">Mrs. E.E.

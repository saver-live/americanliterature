&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Blush not so! O blush not so!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I shall think you knowing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you smile the blushing while,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then maidenheads are going.

II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a blush for want, and a blush for shan't,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a blush for having done it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a blush for thought, and a blush for nought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a blush for just begun it.

III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sigh not so! O sigh not so!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it sounds of Eve's sweet pippin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By these loosen'd lips you have tasted the pips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fought in an amorous nipping.

IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you play once more at nice-cut-core,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it only will last our youth out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have the prime of the kissing time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not one sweet tooth out.

V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a sigh for aye, and a sigh for nay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a sigh for "I can't bear it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O what can be done, shall we stay or run?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O cut the sweet apple and share it!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O that a week could be an age, and we
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt parting and warm meeting every week,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then one poor year a thousand years would be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flush of welcome ever on the cheek:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So could we live long life in little space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So time itself would be annihilate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a day's journey in oblivious haze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve ourjoys would lengthen and dilate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O to arrive each Monday morn from Ind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To land each Tuesday from the rich Levant!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In little time a host of joys to bind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep our souls in one eternal pant!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morn, my friend, and yester-evening taught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me how to harbour such a happy thought.

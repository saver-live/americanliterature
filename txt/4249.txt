<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Morning from her orient chamber came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her first footsteps touch'd a verdant hill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowning its lawny crest with amber flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silv'ring the untainted gushes of its rill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, pure from mossy beds, did down distill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after parting beds of simple flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By many streams a little lake did fill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which round its marge reflected woven bowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in its middle space, a sky that never lowers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the king-fisher saw his plumage bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vieing with fish of brilliant dye below;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose silken fins, and golden scales' light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast upward, through the waves, a ruby glow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There saw the swan his neck of arched snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oar'd himself along with majesty;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkled his jetty eyes; his feet did show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the waves like Afric's ebony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on his back a fay reclined voluptuously.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! could I tell the wonders of an isle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in that fairest lake had placed been,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could e'en Dido of her grief beguile;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rob from aged Lear his bitter teen:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sure so fair a place was never seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that ever charm'd romantic eye:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seem'd an emerald in the silver sheen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bright waters; or as when on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through clouds of fleecy white, laughs the cÂœrulean sky.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all around it dipp'd luxuriously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slopings of verdure through the glossy tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, as it were in gentle amity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rippled delighted up the flowery side;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to glean the ruddy tears, it tried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which fell profusely from the rose-tree stem!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haply it was the workings of its pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In strife to throw upon the shore a gem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outviewing all the buds in Flora's diadem.

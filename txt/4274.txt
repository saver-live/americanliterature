<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou from the caves of Golconda, a gem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure as the ice-drop that froze on the mountain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright as the humming-bird's green diadem,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it flutters in sun-beams that shine through a fountain?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou a goblet for dark sparkling wine?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That goblet right heavy, and massy, and gold?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And splendidly mark'd with the story divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Armida the fair, and Rinaldo the bold?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou a steed with a mane richly flowing?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou a sword that thine enemy's smart is?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou a trumpet rich melodies blowing?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wear'st thou the shield of the famÂ’d Britomartis?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it that hangs from thy shoulder, so brave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embroidered with many a spring peering flower?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a scarf that thy fair lady gave?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hastest thou now to that fair lady's bower?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! courteous Sir Knight, with large joy thou art crown'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full many the glories that brighten thy youth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell thee my blisses, which richly abound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In magical powers to bless, and to sooth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this scroll thou seest written in characters fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sun-beamy tale of a wreath, and a chain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, warrior, it nurtures the property rare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of charming my mind from the trammels of pain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This canopy mark: 'tis the work of a fay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath its rich shade did King Oberon languish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lovely Titania was far, far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cruelly left him to sorrow, and anguish.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, oft would he bring from his soft sighing lute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild strains to which, spell-bound, the nightingales listened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wondering spirits of heaven were mute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears 'mong the dewdrops of morning oft glistened.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this little dome, all those melodies strange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft, plaintive, and melting, for ever will sigh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor e'er will the notes from their tenderness change;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor e'er will the music of Oberon die.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when I am in a voluptuous vein,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pillow my head on the sweets of the rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And list to the tale of the wreath, and the chain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till its echoes depart; then I sink to repose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu, valiant Eric! with joy thou art crown'd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full many the glories that brighten thy youth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too have my blisses, which richly abound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In magical powers, to bless and to sooth.

<p>At evening I make it down the mountain.<br> Keeping company with the moon.<br> Looking back I see the paths I've taken<br> Blue now, blue beneath the skyline.<br> You greet me, show the hidden track,<br> Where children pull back hawthorn curtains,<br> Reveal green bamboo, the secret path,<br> Vines that touch the traveller's clothes.<br> I love finding space to rest,<br> Clear wine to enjoy with you.<br> Wind in the pines till voices stop,<br> Songs till the Ocean of Heaven pales.<br> I get drunk and you are happy,<br> Both of us pleased to forget the world. <br></p>

<p><span class="al-title">Antigone</span> is the third in the series of Theban plays by Sophocles, though it was the first written in the series (about 441 BC). Its title is the daughter/sister of Oedipus, and his mother Jocasta (yes, it's complicated and tragic). We recommend reading all three plays, though they are considered distinct pieces of literature and should be analyzed individually. The other two Theban plays are <a class al-title href="https://americanliterature.com/author/sophocles/play/oedipus-the-king/summary">Opedipus the King</a>, followed by <a class al-title href="https://americanliterature.com/author/sophocles/play/oedipus-at-colonus/summary">Oedipus at Colonus</a>.</p><p><img alt="Oedipus at Colonus-draft" title="Sophocles manuscript" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/play/oedipus-the-king.jpg" style="max-width:400px; float:left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3690757061" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p><p><a href="argument">ARGUMENT</a></p><p><a href="dramatis-personae">DRAMATIS PERSONAE</a></p><p><a href="antigone">ANTIGONE</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/sophocles">Sophocles</a> library. </p>

<p>Give me comfortless seasons of sickness,<br> Visitations of wrath and of wrong<br> On my house; Lord, take child and companion,<br> And destroy the sweet power of song.<br> <br> Thus I pray at each matins, each vespers,<br> After these many wearying days,<br> That the storm-cloud which broods over Russia<br> May be changed to a nimbus ablaze.</p>

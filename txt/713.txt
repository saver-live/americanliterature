<p> At Cor-inth, in Greece, there lived a very wise man whose name was Di-ogÂ´e-nes. Men came from all parts of the land to see him and hear him talk. </p><p> But wise as he was, he had some very queer ways. He did not believe that any man ought to have more things than he re-al-ly needed; and he said that no man needed much. And so he did not live in a house, but slept in a tub or barrel, which he rolled about from place to place. He spent his days sitting in the sun, and saying wise things to those who were around him. </p><p> At noon one day, Di-og-e-nes was seen walking through the streets with a lighted lantern, and looking all around as if in search of something. </p><p> "Why do you carry a lantern when the sun is shining?" some one said. </p><p> "I am looking for an honest man," answered Diogenes. </p><p> When Alexander the Great went to Cor-inth, all the fore-most men in the city came out to see him and to praise him. But Diogenes did not come; and he was the only man for whose o-pin-ions Alexander cared. </p><p> And so, since the wise man would not come to see the king, the king went to see the wise man. He found Diogenes in an out-of-the-way place, lying on the ground by his tub. He was en-joy-ing the heat and the light of the sun. </p><p> When he saw the king and a great many people coming, he sat up and looked at Alexander. Alexander greeted him and said,-- </p><p> "Diogenes, I have heard a great deal about your wisdom. Is there anything that I can do for you?" </p><p> "Yes," said Diogenes. "You can stand a little on one side, so as not to keep the sunshine from me." </p><p> This answer was so dif-fer-ent from what he expected, that the king was much sur-prised. But it did not make him angry; it only made him admire the strange man all the more. When he turned to ride back, he said to his officers,-- </p><p> "Say what you will; if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Clunton and Clunbury,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clungunford and Clun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the quietest places
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sun. </i>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In valleys of springs of rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Ony and Teme and Clun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country for easy livers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quietest under the sun,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had sorrows to lighten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could not be always glad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lads knew trouble at Knighton
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a Knighton lad.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By bridges that Thames runs under,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In London, the town built ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis sure small matter for wonder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If sorrow is with one still.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if as a lad grows older
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubles he bears are more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carries his griefs on a shoulder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That handselled them long before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shall one halt to deliver
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This luggage I'd lief set down?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Thames, not Teme is the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor London nor Knighton the town:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a long way further than Knighton,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quieter place than Clun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where doomsday may thunder and lighten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And little 'twill matter to one.

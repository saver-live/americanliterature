<p>WHEN I am dead, and doctors know not why,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>And my friends' curiosity<br> Will have me cut up to survey each part,<br> When they shall find your picture in my heart,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>You think a sudden damp of love<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>Will thorough all their senses move,<br> And work on them as me, and so prefer<br> Your murder to the name of massacre,<br> <br> Poor victories; but if you dare be brave,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>And pleasure in your conquest have,<br> First kill th' enormous giant, your Disdain;<br> And let th' enchantress Honour, next be slain;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>And like a Goth and Vandal rise,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>Deface records and histories<br> Of your own arts and triumphs over men,<br> And without such advantage kill me then,<br> <br> For I could muster up, as well as you,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>My giants, and my witches too,<br> Which are vast Constancy and Secretness;<br> But these I neither look for nor profess;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>Kill me as woman, let me die<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:3em;">&nbsp;</span>As a mere man; do you but try<br> Your passive valour, and you shall find then,<br> Naked you have odds enough of any man.</p>

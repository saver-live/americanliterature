<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we set on earth for? Say, to toil;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor seek to leave thy tending of the vines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the heat o' the day, till it declines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Death's mild curfew shall from work assoil.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God did anoint thee with his odorous oil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrestle, not to reign; and He assigns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thy tears over, like pure crystallines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For younger fellow-workers of the soil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wear for amulets. So others shall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take patience, labor, to their heart and hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thy hand and thy heart and thy brave cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God's grace fructify through thee to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The least flower with a brimming cup may stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And share its dew-drop with another near.
</pre>

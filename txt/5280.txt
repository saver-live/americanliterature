<p>The distant goal is won.</p>
<p>With eyes half-shut to the blinding dust,<br> And necks to the yokes bent low,<br> The beasts are pulling as bullocks must;<br> And the shining tires might almost rust<br> While the spokes are turning slow.</p>
<p>With face half-hid by a broad-rimmed hat,<br> That shades from the heat's white waves,<br> And shouldered whip, with its green-hide plait,<br> The driver plods with a gait like that<br> Of his weary, patient slaves.</p>
<p>He wipes his brow, for the day is hot,<br> And spits to the left with spite;<br> He shouts at Bally, and flicks at Scot,<br> And raises dust from the back of Spot,<br> And spits to the dusty right.</p>
<p>He'll sometimes pause as a thing of form<br> In front of a settler's door,<br> And ask for a drink, and remark "It's warm,"<br> Or say "There's signs of a thunderstorm;"<br> But he seldom utters more.</p>
<p>The rains are heavy on roads like these<br> And, fronting his lonely home,<br> For days together the settler sees<br> The waggons bogged to the axletrees,<br> Or ploughing the sodden loam.</p>
<p>And then, when the roads are at their worst,<br> The bushman's children hear<br> The cruel blows of the whips reversed<br> While bullocks pull as their hearts would burst,<br> And bellow with pain and fear.</p>
<p>And thus—with glimpses of home and rest—<br> Are the long, long journeys done; And thus—<br> 'tis a thankless life at the best!—<br> Is Distance fought in the mighty West,<br> And the lonely battle won.<br></p>

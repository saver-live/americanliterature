&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But where do you go?' said the lady, while both sat under the yew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her eyes were alive in their depth, as the kraken beneath the sea-blue.

II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because I fear you,' he answered; 'because you are far too fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And able to strangle my soul in a mesh of your golfd-coloured hair.'

III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason! Such knots are quickly undone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And too much beauty, I reckon, is nothing but too much sun.'

IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yet farewell so,' he answered; 'the sunstroke's fatal at times.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I value your husband, Lord Walter, whose gallop rings still from the limes.

V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason. You smell a rose through a fence:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two should smell it what matter? who grumbles, and where's the pretense?

VI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But I,' he replied, 'have promised another, when love was free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To love her alone, alone, who alone from afar loves me.'

VII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Why, that,' she said, 'is no reason. Love's always free I am told.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you vow to be safe from the headache on Tuesday, and think it will hold?

VIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But you,' he replied, 'have a daughter, a young child, who was laid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your lap to be pure; so I leave you: the angels would make me afraid."

IX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason. The angels keep out of the way;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Dora, the child, observes nothing, although you should please me and stay.'

X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which he rose up in his anger, 'Why now, you no longer are fair!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, now, you no longer are fatal, but ugly and hateful, I swear.'

XI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which she laughed out in her scorn: 'These men! Oh these men overnice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are shocked if a colour not virtuous is frankly put on by a vice.'

XII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes blazed upon him, 'And you! You bring us your vices so near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we smell them! You think in our presence a thought 'twould defame us to hear!

XIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What reason had you, and what right, I appel to your soul from my life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find me so fair as a woman? Why, sir, I am pure, and a wife.

XIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Is the day-star too fair up above you? It burns you not. Dare you imply
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brushed you more close than the star does, when Walter had set me as high?

XV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If a man finds a woman too fair, he means simply adapted too much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use unlawful and fatal. The praise! shall I thank you for such?

XVI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Too fair? not unless you misuse us! and surely if, once in a while,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You attain to it, straightaway you call us no longer too fair, but too vile.

XVII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A moment, I pray your attention! I have a poor word in my head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must utter, though womanly custom would set it down better unsaid.

XVIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You grew, sir, pale to impertinence, once when I showed you a ring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You kissed my fan when I dropped it. No matter! I've broken the thing.

XIX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You did me the honour, perhaps, to be moved at my side now and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the senses, a vice, I have heard, which is common to beasts and some men.

XX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Love's a virtue for heroes! as white as the snow on high hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And immortal as every great soul is that struggles, endures, and fulfils.

XXI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I love my Walter profoundly, you, Maude, though you faltered a week,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of . . . what is it, an eyebrow? or, less still, a mole on the cheek?

XXII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And since, when all's said, you're too noble to stoop to the frivolous cant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About crimes irresistable, virtues that swindle, betray and supplant.

XXIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I determined to prove to yourself that, whate'er you might dream or avow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By illusion, you wanted precisely no more of me than you have now.

XXIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There! Look me full in the face! in the face. Understand, if you can,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the eyes of such women as I am are clean as the palm of a man.

XXV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Drop his hand, you insult him. Avoid us for fear we should cost you a scar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take us for harlots, I tell you, and not for the women we are.

XXVI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You wronged me: but then I considered . . . there's Walter! And so at the end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I vowed that he should not be mulcted, by me, in the hand of a friend.

XXVII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Have I hurt you indeed? We are quits then. Nay, friend of my Walter, be mine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, Dora, my darling, my angel, and help me to ask him to dine.'

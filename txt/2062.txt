<p>I dwell in Possibility —<br> A fairer House than Prose —<br> More numerous of Windows —<br> Superior — for Doors —<br> <br> Of Chambers as the Cedars —<br> Impregnable of Eye —<br> And for an Everlasting Roof<br> The Gambrels of the Sky —<br> <br> Of Visitors — the fairest —<br> For Occupation — This —<br> The spreading wide my narrow Hands<br> To gather Paradise —</p>

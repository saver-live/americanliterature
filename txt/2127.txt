<p>For my first twenty years, since yesterday,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>I scarce believed thou couldst be gone away;<br> For forty more I fed on favours past,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>And forty on hopes that thou wouldst they might last;<br> Tears drown'd one hundred, and sighs blew out two;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>A thousand, I did neither think nor do,<br> Or not divide, all being one thought of you;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Or in a thousand more, forgot that too.<br> Yet call not this long life; but think that I<br> Am, by being dead, immortal; can ghosts die?</p>

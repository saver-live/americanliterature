<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearken, thou craggy ocean pyramid!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give answer by thy voice, the sea-fowls' screams!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When were thy shoulders mantled in huge streams?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, from the sun, was thy broad forehead hid?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long is't since the mighty Power bid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee heave to airy sleep from fathom dreams?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep in the lap of thunder or sunbeams,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or when grey clouds are thy cold coverlid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou answer'st not; for thou art dead asleep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy life is but two dead eternities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last in air, the former in the deep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First with the whales, last with the eagle-skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drowned wast thou till an earthquake made thee steep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cannot wake thy giant-size!

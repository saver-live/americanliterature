<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has laughed as softly as if she sighed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has counted six, and over,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a purse well filled, and a heart well tried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, each a worthy lover!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They "give her time"; for her soul must slip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the world has set the grooving;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will lie to none with her fair red lip:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But love seeks truer loving.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She trembles her fan in a sweetness dumb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As her thoughts were beyond recalling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a glance for one, and a glance for some,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her eyelids rising and falling;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaks common words with a blushful air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hears bold words, unreproving;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her silence says, what she never will swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love seeks better loving.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, lady! lean to the night-guitar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drop a smile to the bringer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then smile as sweetly, when he is far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the voice of an in-door singer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bask tenderly beneath tender eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glance lightly, on their removing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And join new vows to old perjuries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dare not call it loving!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you can think, when the song is done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other is soft in the rhythm;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you can feel, when left by One,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all men else go with him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you can know, when unpraised by his breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That your beauty itself wants proving;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you can swear "For life, for death!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, fear to call it loving!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you can muse in a crowd all day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the absent face that fixed you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you can love, as the angels may,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the breadth of heaven betwixt you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you can dream that his faith is fast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through behoving and unbehoving;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you can die when the dream is past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, never call it loving!

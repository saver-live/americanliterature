<p>Gold dovecote by waters,<br> Tender and dazzlingly green;<br> A salt-breeze sweeps away<br> The gondola's narrow wake.<br> <br> Such sensitive, strange eyes in the streets,<br> The bright toys in the shops:<br> A lion with a book, on a lace pillow,<br> A lion with a book, on a marble pillar.<br> <br> As in an ancient, faded canvas,<br> The sky is a cool, dull blueâ€¦<br> But one's not crushed in the crowd,<br> Nor stifled in this damp heat.<br></p>

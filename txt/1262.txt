<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two savings of the Holy Scriptures beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like pulses in the Church's brow and breast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by them we find rest in our unrest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, heart deep in salt-tears, do yet entreat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's fellowship as if on heavenly seat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is Jesus wept, whereon is prest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full many a sobbing face that drops its best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweetest waters on the record sweet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one is where the Christ, denied and scorned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked upon Peter. Oh, to render plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By help of having loved a little and mourned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That look of sovran love and sovran pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which He, who could not sin yet suffered, turned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On him who could reject but not sustain!

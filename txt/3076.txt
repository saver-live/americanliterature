<i>Chorus:</i>
Make me a bed right down on your floor
Make me a bed right down on your floor
I'll rest my head in a bed on your floor.

<i>Verses:</i>
I'm a poor lonesome boy, I'm a long ways from home
I'm a poor lonesome boy, I'm a long way from home
And I'll rest my head in a bed on your floor.

Sheriff on my trail with a big forty-four
Sheriff on my trail with a big forty-four
And I'll rest my head in a bed on your floor.

Clock striking midnight and daylight to go
Clock striking midnight and daylight to go
And I'll rest my head in a bed on your floor.

Pull down your shade and lock up your door
Pull down your shade and lock up your door
And I'll rest my head in a bed on your floor.

That bully of the town won't bully me no more
That bully of the town won't bully me no more
'Cause I laid him dead on the old bar room floor.

I laid a man dead down on the floor
I laid a man dead down on the floor
So I'll rest my head in a bed on your floor.

Make me a bed right down on your floor
Make me a bed right down on your floor
Baby I'll rest my head in a bed on your floor.

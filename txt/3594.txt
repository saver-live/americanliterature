<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be still, my soul, be still; the arms you bear are brittle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think rather,-call to thought, if now you grieve a little,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men loved unkindness then, but lightless in the quarry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slept and saw not; tears fell down, I did not mourn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweat ran and blood sprang out and I was never sorry:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it was well with me, in days ere I was born.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, and I muse for why and never find the reason,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pace the earth, and drink the air, and feel the sun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be still, be still, my soul; it is but for a season:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us endure an hour and see injustice done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts to rive the heart are here, and all are vain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh why did I awake? when shall I sleep again?
</pre>

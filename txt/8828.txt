<p>Love will make men dare to die for their beloved. . . Of this<br> Alcestis is a monument . . . for she was willing to lay down her<br> life for her husband . . . and so noble did this appear to the gods<br> that they granted her the privilege of returning to earth . . . but<br> Orpheus, the son of OEagrus, they sent empty away. . ._<br> <br> --PLATO: _The Symposium._<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> ORPHEUS the Harper, coming to the gate<br> Where the implacable dim warder sate,<br> Besought for parley with a shade within,<br> Dearer to him than life itself had been,<br> Sweeter than sunlight on Illyrian sea,<br> Or bloom of myrtle, or murmur of laden bee,<br> Whom lately from his unconsenting breast<br> The Fates, at some capricious blind behest,<br> Intolerably had reft--Eurydice,<br> Dear to the sunlight as Illyrian sea,<br> Sweet as the murmur of bees, or myrtle bloom--<br> And uncompanioned led her to the tomb.<br> <br> There, solitary by the Stygian tide,<br> Strayed her dear feet, the shadow of his own,<br> Since, 'mid the desolate millions who have died,<br> Each phantom walks its crowded path alone;<br> And there her head, that slept upon his breast,<br> No more had such sweet harbour for its rest,<br> Nor her swift ear from those disvoiced throats<br> Could catch one echo of his living notes,<br> And, dreaming nightly of her pallid doom,<br> No solace had he of his own young bloom,<br> But yearned to pour his blood into her veins<br> And buy her back with unimagined pains.<br> <br> To whom the Shepherd of the Shadows said:<br> "Yea, many thus would bargain for their dead;<br> But when they hear my fatal gateway clang<br> Life quivers in them with a last sweet pang.<br> They see the smoke of home above the trees,<br> The cordage whistles on the harbour breeze;<br> The beaten path that wanders to the shore<br> Grows dear because they shall not tread it more,<br> The dog that drowsing on their threshold lies<br> Looks at them with their childhood in his eyes,<br> And in the sunset's melancholy fall<br> They read a sunrise that shall give them all."<br> <br> "Not thus am I," the Harper smiled his scorn.<br> "I see no path but those her feet have worn;<br> My roof-tree is the shadow of her hair,<br> And the light breaking through her long despair<br> The only sunrise that mine eyelids crave;<br> For doubly dead without me in the grave<br> Is she who, if my feet had gone before,<br> Had found life dark as death's abhorred shore."<br> <br> The gate clanged on him, and he went his way<br> Amid the alien millions, mute and grey,<br> Swept like a cold mist down an unlit strand,<br> Where nameless wreckage gluts the stealthy sand,<br> Drift of the cockle-shells of hope and faith<br> Wherein they foundered on the rock of death.<br> <br> So came he to the image that he sought<br> (Less living than her semblance in his thought),<br> Who, at the summons of his thrilling notes,<br> Drew back to life as a drowned creature floats<br> Back to the surface; yet no less is dead.<br> And cold fear smote him till she spoke and said:<br> "Art thou then come to lay thy lips on mine,<br> And pour thy life's libation out like wine?<br> Shall I, through thee, revisit earth again,<br> Traverse the shining sea, the fruitful plain,<br> Behold the house we dwelt in, lay my head<br> Upon the happy pillows of our bed,<br> And feel in dreams the pressure of thine arms<br> Kindle these pulses that no memory warms?<br> Nay: give me for a space upon thy breast<br> Death's shadowy substitute for rapture--rest;<br> Then join again the joyous living throng,<br> And give me life, but give it in thy song;<br> For only they that die themselves may give<br> Life to the dead: and I would have thee live."<br> <br> Fear seized him closer than her arms; but he<br> Answered: "Not so--for thou shalt come with me!<br> I sought thee not that we should part again,<br> But that fresh joy should bud from the old pain;<br> And the gods, if grudgingly their gifts they make,<br> Yield all to them that without asking take."<br> <br> "The gods," she said, "(so runs life's ancient lore)<br> Yield all man takes, but always claim their score.<br> The iron wings of the Eumenides<br> When heard far off seem but a summer breeze;<br> But me thou'lt have alive on earth again<br> Only by paying here my meed of pain.<br> Then lay on my cold lips the tender ghost<br> Of the dear kiss that used to warm them most,<br> Take from my frozen hands thy hands of fire,<br> And of my heart-strings make thee a new lyre,<br> That in thy music men may find my voice,<br> And something of me still on earth rejoice."<br> <br> Shuddering he heard her, but with close-flung arm<br> Swept her resisting through the ghostly swarm.<br> "Swift, hide thee 'neath my cloak, that we may glide<br> Past the dim warder as the gate swings wide."<br> He whirled her with him, lighter than a leaf<br> Unwittingly whirled onward by a brief<br> Autumnal eddy; but when the fatal door<br> Suddenly yielded him to life once more,<br> And issuing to the all-consoling skies<br> He turned to seek the sunlight in her eyes,<br> He clutched at emptiness--she was not there;<br> And the dim warder answered to his prayer:<br> "Only once have I seen the wonder wrought.<br> But when Alcestis thus her master sought,<br> Living she sought him not, nor dreamed that fate<br> For any subterfuge would swing my gate.<br> Loving, she gave herself to livid death,<br> Joyous she bought his respite with her breath,<br> Came, not embodied, but a tenuous shade,<br> In whom her rapture a great radiance made.<br> For never saw I ghost upon this shore<br> Shine with such living ecstasy before,<br> Nor heard an exile from the light above<br> Hail me with smiles: _Thou art not Death but Love!_<br> <br> "But when the gods, frustrated, this beheld,<br> How, living still, among the dead she dwelled,<br> Because she lived in him whose life she won,<br> And her blood beat in his beneath the sun,<br> They reasoned: 'When the bitter Stygian wave<br> The sweetness of love's kisses cannot lave,<br> When the pale flood of Lethe washes not<br> From mortal mind one high immortal thought,<br> Akin to us the earthly creature grows,<br> Since nature suffers only what it knows.<br> If she whom we to this grey desert banned<br> Still dreams she treads with him the sunlit land<br> That for his sake she left without a tear,<br> Set wide the gates--her being is not here.'<br> <br> "So ruled the gods; but thou, that sought'st to give<br> Thy life for love, yet for thyself wouldst live.<br> They know not for their kin; but back to earth<br> Give, pitying, one that is of mortal birth."<br> <br> Humbled the Harper heard, and turned away,<br> Mounting alone to the empoverished day;<br> Yet, as he left the Stygian shades behind,<br> He heard the cordage on the harbour wind,<br> Saw the blue smoke above the homestead trees,<br> And in his hidden heart was glad of these.</p>

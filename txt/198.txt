<p>Already the maple leaves<br> Cover the swans' pool,<br> And the blood-stained arms<br> Of late-ripening rowan.<br> <br> And, dazzlingly slender,<br> Crossed legs impervious to cold,<br> She sits on a northern stone,<br> And gazes at the road.<br> <br> Ifelt a vague fear,<br> In front of this famous girl.<br> Rays of thinning light<br> Playing over her shoulders.<br> <br> And how could I forgive her<br> Your delight, your enamoured praiseâ€¦<br> Look there, elegantly naked,<br> It's a joy to her to be sad.<br></p>

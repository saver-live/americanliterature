<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain, it streams on stone and hillock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boot clings to the clay.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since all is done thats due and right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets home; and now, my lad, good-night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I must turn away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good-night, my lad, for noughts eternal;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No league of ours, for sure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow I shall miss you less,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ache of heart and heaviness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are things that time should cure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the hill the highway marches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whats beyond is wide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh soon enough will pine to nought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembrance and the faithful thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sits the grave beside.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skies, they are not always raining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor grey the twelvemonth through;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall meet good days and mirth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And range the lovely lands of earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With friends no worse than you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh, my man, the house is fallen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That none can build again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My man, how full of joy and woe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mother bore you years ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-night to lie in the rain.

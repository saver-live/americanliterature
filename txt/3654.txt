<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It nods and curtseys and recovers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind blows above,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nettle on the graves of lovers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hanged themselves for love.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nettle nods, the wind blows over,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man, he does not move,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lover of the grave, the lover
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hanged himself for love.

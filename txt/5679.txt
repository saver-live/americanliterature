<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark is the morning with mist; in the narrow mouth of the harbor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless lies the sea, under its curtain of cloud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamily glimmer the sails of ships on the distant horizon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to the towers of a town, built on the verge of the sea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly and stately and still, they sail forth into the ocean;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them sail my thoughts over the limitless deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther and farther away, borne on by unsatisfied longings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto Hesperian isles, unto Ausonian shores.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they have vanished away, have disappeared in the ocean;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunk are the towers of the town into the depths of the sea!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AU have vanished but those that, moored in the neighboring roadstead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailless at anchor ride, looming so large in the mist.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished, too, are the thoughts, the dim, unsatisfied longings;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunk are the turrets of cloud into the ocean of dreams;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in a haven of rest my heart is riding at anchor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held by the chains of love, held by the anchors of trust!

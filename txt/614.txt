<p>If heaven loved not the wine,<br> A Wine Star would not be in heaven;<br> If earth loved not the wine,<br> The Wine Spring would not be on the earth.<br> Since heaven and earth love the wine,<br> Need a tippling mortal be ashamed?<br> The transparent wine, I hear,<br> Has the soothing virtue of a sage,<br> While the turgid is rich, they say,<br> As the fertile mind of the wise.<br> Both the sage and the wise were drinkers,<br> Why seek for peers among gods and goblins?<br> Three cups open the grand door to bliss;<br> Take a jugful, the universe is yours.<br> Such is the rapture of the wine,<br> That the sober shall never inherit. <br></p>

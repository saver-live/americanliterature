<p>Like one betrothed I receive<br> A letter at each day's end,<br> And late at night conceive<br> An answer for my friend.<br> <br> 'On my journey to the dark,<br> I'm staying with white death.<br> Do no harm, my gentle one,<br> To anyone on earth.'<br> <br> Brighter, a star is shining<br> Between that pair of trees,<br> Calmly promising<br> That what I dream will be.<br></p>

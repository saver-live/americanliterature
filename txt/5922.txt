<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shores of Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the shining Big-Sea-Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood Nokomis, the old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing with her finger westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the water pointing westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the purple clouds of sunset.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiercely the red sun descending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned his way along the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the sky on fire behind him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As war-parties, when retreating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burn the prairies on their war-trail;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon, the Night-sun, eastward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly starting from his ambush,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed fast those bloody footprints,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed in that fiery war-trail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its glare upon his features.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nokomis, the old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing with her finger westward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake these words to Hiawatha:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yonder dwells the great Pearl-Feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Megissogwon, the Magician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manito of Wealth and Wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarded by his fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarded by the black pitch-water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see his fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kenabeek, the great serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coiling, playing in the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see the black pitch-water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretching far away beyond them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the purple clouds of sunset!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He it was who slew my father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his wicked wiles and cunning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he from the moon descended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came on earth to seek me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, the mightiest of Magicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the fever from the marshes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the pestilential vapors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the poisonous exhalations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the white fog from the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends disease and death among us!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take your bow, O Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take your arrows, jasper-headed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take your war-club, Puggawaugun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your birch-canoe for sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the oil of Mishe-Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to smear its sides, that swiftly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may pass the black pitch-water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slay this merciless magician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the people from the fever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he breathes across the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And avenge my father's murder!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway then my Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed himself with all his war-gear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launched his birch-canoe for sailing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his palm its sides he patted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said with glee, "Cheemaun, my darling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my Birch-canoe! leap forward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you see the fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you see the black pitch-water!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward leaped Cheemaun exulting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the noble Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang his war-song wild and woful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above him the war-eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Keneu, the great war-eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master of all fowls with feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screamed and hurtled through the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon he reached the fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kenabeek, the great serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying huge upon the water,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkling, rippling in the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying coiled across the passage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their blazing crests uplifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing fiery fogs and vapors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that none could pass beyond them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fearless Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried aloud, and spake in this wise:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me pass my way, Kenabeek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go upon my journey!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they answered, hissing fiercely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their fiery breath made answer:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back, go back! O Shaugodaya!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the angry Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised his mighty bow of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized his arrows, jasper-headed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot them fast among the serpents;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every twanging of the bow-string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a war-cry and a death-cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every whizzing of an arrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a death-song of Kenabeek.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weltering in the bloody water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead lay all the fiery serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among them Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless sailed, and cried exulting:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Onward, O Cheemaun, my darling!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward to the black pitch-water!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took the oil of Nahma,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bows and sides anointed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smeared them well with oil, that swiftly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might pass the black pitch-water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night long he sailed upon it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed upon that sluggish water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered with its mould of ages,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black with rotting water-rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rank with flags and leaves of lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stagnant, lifeless, dreary, dismal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted by the shimmering moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by will-o'-the-wisps illumined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their weary night-encampments.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the air was white with moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the water black with shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around him the Suggema,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mosquito, sang his war-song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fire-flies, Wah-wah-taysee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved their torches to mislead him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bull-frog, the Dahinda,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust his head into the moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed his yellow eyes upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobbed and sank beneath the surface;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And anon a thousand whistles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered over all the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off on the reedy margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heralded the hero's coming.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward thus fared Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the realm of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the land of the Pearl-Feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the level moon stared at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his face stared pale and haggard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sun was hot behind him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it burned upon his shoulders,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before him on the upland
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could see the Shining Wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Manito of Wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the mightiest of Magicians.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then once more Cheemaun he patted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his birch-canoe said, "Onward!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it stirred in all its fibres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with one great bound of triumph
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped across the water-lilies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped through tangled flags and rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon the beach beyond them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry-shod landed Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight he took his bow of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sand one end he rested,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his knee he pressed the middle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched the faithful bow-string tighter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took an arrow, jasper-headed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot it at the Shining Wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent it singing as a herald,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bearer of his message,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his challenge loud and lofty:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come forth from your lodge, Pearl-Feather!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha waits your coming!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway from the Shining Wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the mighty Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall of stature, broad of shoulder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark and terrible in aspect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad from head to foot in wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed with all his warlike weapons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted like the sky of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaked with crimson, blue, and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crested with great eagle-feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming upward, streaming outward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well I know you, Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried he in a voice of thunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tone of loud derision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hasten back, O Shaugodaya!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasten back among the women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will slay you as you stand there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of old I slew her father!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my Hiawatha answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing daunted, fearing nothing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big words do not smite like war-clubs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boastful breath is not a bow-string,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taunts are not so sharp as arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeds are better things than words are,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions mightier than boastings!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then began the greatest battle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sun had ever looked on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the war-birds ever witnessed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All a Summer's day it lasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sunrise to the sunset;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the shafts of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless hit the shirt of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless fell the blows he dealt it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens, Minjekahwun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harmless fell the heavy war-club;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could dash the rocks asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it could not break the meshes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that magic shirt of wampum.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at sunset Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning on his bow of ash-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounded, weary, and desponding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mighty war-club broken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mittens torn and tattered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three useless arrows only,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From whose branches trailed the mosses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whose trunk was coated over
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Dead-man's Moccasin-leather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fungus white and yellow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly from the boughs above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the Mama, the woodpecker:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aim your arrows, Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the head of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike the tuft of hair upon it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At their roots the long black tresses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There alone can he be wounded!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winged with feathers, tipped with jasper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift flew Hiawatha's arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Megissogwon, stooping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised a heavy stone to throw it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full upon the crown it struck him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the roots of his long tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he reeled and staggered forward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunging like a wounded bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, like Pezhekee, the bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the snow is on the prairie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter flew the second arrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pathway of the other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piercing deeper than the other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounding sorer than the other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the knees of Megissogwon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook like windy reeds beneath him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent and trembled like the rushes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the third and latest arrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftest flew, and wounded sorest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty Megissogwon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the fiery eyes of Pauguk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the eyes of Death glare at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard his voice call in the darkness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feet of Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifeless lay the great Pearl-Feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the mightiest of Magicians.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the grateful Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called the Mama, the woodpecker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his perch among the branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the melancholy pine-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in honor of his service,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stained with blood the tuft of feathers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the little head of Mama;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to this day he wears it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wears the tuft of crimson feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a symbol of his service.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he stripped the shirt of wampum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the back of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a trophy of the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a signal of his conquest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore he left the body,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half on land and half in water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sand his feet were buried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his face was in the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above him, wheeled and clamored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Keneu, the great war-eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing round in narrower circles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovering nearer, nearer, nearer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wigwam Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore the wealth of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his wealth of skins and wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furs of bison and of beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furs of sable and of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wampum belts and strings and pouches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quivers wrought with beads of wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with arrows, silver-headed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward then he sailed exulting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward through the black pitch-water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward through the weltering serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the trophies of the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a shout and song of triumph.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore stood old Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore stood Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the hero's coming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to his songs of triumph.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people of the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcomed him with songs and dances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a joyous feast, and shouted:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor be to Hiawatha!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has slain the great Pearl-Feather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slain the mightiest of Magicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him, who sent the fiery fever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the white fog from the fen-lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent disease and death among us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever dear to Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the memory of Mama!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in token of his friendship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mark of his remembrance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He adorned and decked his pipe-stem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the crimson tuft of feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blood-red crest of Mama.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wealth of Megissogwon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the trophies of the battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He divided with his people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared it equally among them.

<p>Drowsiness returns me<br> To our last starry paradise –<br> That city of pure fountains,<br> Golden Bakhchisarai.<br> <br> There behind the striped fence,<br> By pensive waters,<br> We remembered with joy<br> The gardens of Tsarskoye Selo.<br> <br> And suddenly we saw<br> Catherine's eagle – there!<br> Swooping into the valley<br> From the wondrous gate of bronze.<br> <br> To keep the song of the pain of parting<br> Alive in the memory,<br> Autumn in her dark skirt<br> Brought the red leaves.<br> <br> Scattered them on the steps,<br> Where I said farewell,<br> Whence into the realm of shadows<br> You my consolation, fled.<br></p>

<p>Good we must love, and must hate ill,<br> For ill is ill, and good good still;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>But there are things indifferent,<br> Which we may neither hate, nor love,<br> But one, and then another prove,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>As we shall find our fancy bent.<br> <br> If then at first wise Nature had<br> Made women either good or bad,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Then some we might hate, and some choose;<br> But since she did them so create,<br> That we may neither love, nor hate,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Only this rests, all all may use.<br> <br> If they were good it would be seen;<br> Good is as visible as green,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>And to all eyes itself betrays.<br> If they were bad, they could not last;<br> Bad doth itself, and others waste;<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>So they deserve nor blame, nor praise.<br> <br> But they are ours as fruits are ours;<br> He that but tastes, he that devours,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>And he that leaves all, doth as well;<br> Changed loves are but changed sorts of meat;<br> And when he hath the kernel eat,<br> <span style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">&nbsp;</span>Who doth not fling away the shell?</p>

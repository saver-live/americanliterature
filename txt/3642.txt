<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldier from the wars returning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoiler of the taken town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is ease that asks not earning;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn you in and sit you down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace is come and wars are over,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome you and welcome all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the charger crops the clover
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his bridle hangs in stall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now no more of winters biting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filth in trench from fall to spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summers full of sweat and fighting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Kesar or the King.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest you, charger, rust you, bridle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kings and kesars, keep your pay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldier, sit you down and idle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the inn of night for aye.
</pre>

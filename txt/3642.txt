<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into my heart an air that kills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From yon far country blows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are those blue remembered hills,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What spires, what farms are those?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the land of lost content,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it shining plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy highways where I went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cannot come again.

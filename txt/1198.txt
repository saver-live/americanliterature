<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all the gentlest-hearted friends I know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concentred in one heart their gentleness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That still grew gentler till its pulse was less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For life than pity, I should yet be slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring my own heart nakedly below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm of such a friend, that he should press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motive, condition, means, appliances,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My false ideal joy and fickle woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out full to light and knowledge; I should fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some plait between the brows, some rougher chime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the free voice. O angels, let your flood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bitter scorn dash on me! do ye hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I say who hear calmly all the time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This everlasting face to face with God?

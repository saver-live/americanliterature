<p>Let the organ peal out once more,<br> Like a first spring thunderstorm;<br> From behind your bride's shoulder,<br> My half-closed eyes will gaze.<br> <br> Farewell, goodbye, be happy my friend,<br> Ireturn you your sweet vow,<br> But don't let your passionate one<br> See my inimitable ravings –<br> <br> That would inject a burning venom<br> Into your blessed, joyful union…<br> And I go to claim a marvellous garden<br> Where grass rustles, the Muse declaims.<br></p>

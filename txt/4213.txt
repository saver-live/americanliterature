&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physician Nature! Let my spirit blood!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O ease my heart of verse and let me rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throw me upon thy Tripod, till the flood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of stifling numbers ebbs from my full breast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A theme! a theme! great nature! give a theme;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin my dream.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come I see thee, as thou standest there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckon me not into the wintry air.

2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! dearest love, sweet home of all my fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hopes, and joys, and panting miseries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-night, if I may guess, thy beauty wears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smile of such delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As brilliant and as bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when with ravished, aching, vassal eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in soft amaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gaze, I gaze!

3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who now, with greedy looks, eats up my feast?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What stare outfaces now my silver moon!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! keep that hand unravished at the least;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let, let, the amorous burn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But pr'ythee, do not turn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current of your heart from me so soon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O! save, in charity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quickest pulse for me.

4.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save it for me, sweet love! though music breathe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluptuous visions into the warm air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though swimming through the dance's dangerous wreath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be like an April day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling and cold and gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A temperate lilly, temperate as fair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Heaven! there will be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warmer June for me.

5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, this, you'll say, my Fanny! is not true:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put your soft hand upon your snowy side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the heart beats: confess 'tis nothing new
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must not a woman be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feather on the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sway'd to and fro by every wind and tide?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of as uncertain speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As blow-ball from the mead?

6.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it and to know it is despair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one who loves you as I love, sweet Fanny!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose heart goes fluttering for you every where,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, when away you roam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare keep its wretched home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, love alone, his pains severe and many:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, loveliest! keep me free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From torturing jealousy.

7.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! if you prize my subdued soul above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor, the fading, brief, pride of an hour;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let none profane my Holy See of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or with a rude hand break
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacramental cake:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let none else touch the just new-budded flower;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not may my eyes close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love! on their lost repose.

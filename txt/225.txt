<p>How can you bear to view the Neva,<br> How can you bear to cross its bridges? ...<br> No surprise I'm marked for sadness,<br> Since that vision of you appeared.<br> Sharp, the black angels' wings,<br> Soon, the judgement day;<br> And raspberry-coloured bonfires blossom<br> Like roses, in the snow.<br></p>

<pre>Sang Solomon to Sheba,
And kissed her dusky face,
All day long from mid-day
We have talked in the one place,
All day long from shadowless noon
We have gone round and round
In the narrow theme of love
Like an old horse in a pound.

To Solomon sang Sheba,
Planted on his knees,
If you had broached a matter
That might the learned please,
You had before the sun had thrown
Our shadows on the ground
Discovered that my thoughts, not it,
Are but a narrow pound.

Said Solomon to Sheba,
And kissed her Arab eyes,
Theres not a man or woman
Born under the skies
Dare match in learning with us two,
And all day long we have found
Theres not a thing but love can make
The world a narrow pound.

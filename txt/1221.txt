<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, God!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a childs voice I cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak, sad, confidingly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, God!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou knowest, eyelids, raised not always up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto Thy love (as none of ours are), droop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ours, oer many a tear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou knowest, though Thy universe is broad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two little tears suffice to cover all:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou knowest, Thou, who art so prodigal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beauty, we are oft but stricken deer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expiring in the woods, that care for none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those delightsome flowers they die upon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O blissful Mouth which breathed the mournful breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We name our souls, self-spoilt! by that strong passion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which paled Thee once with sighs, by that strong death
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made Thee once unbreathing, from the wrack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Themselves have called around them, call them back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Thee in continuous aspiration!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For here, O Lord,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For here they travel vainly, vainly pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From city-pavement to untrodden sward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the lark finds her deep nest in the grass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold with the earths last dew. Yea, very vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest speed of all these souls of men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless they travel upward to the throne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where sittest THOU, the satisfying ONE,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With help for sins and holy perfectings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all requirements, while the archangel, raising
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto Thy face his full ecstatic gazing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgets the rush and rapture of his wings.

<p>Leaguered in fire<br> The wild black promontories of the coast extend<br> Their savage silhouettes;<br> The sun in universal carnage sets,<br> And, halting higher,<br> The motionless storm-clouds mass their sullen threats,<br> Like an advancing mob in sword-points penned,<br> That, balked, yet stands at bay.<br> Mid-zenith hangs the fascinated day<br> In wind-lustrated hollows crystalline,<br> A wan valkyrie whose wide pinions shine<br> Across the ensanguined ruins of the fray,<br> And in her lifted hand swings high o'erhead,<br> Above the waste of war,<br> The silver torch-light of the evening star<br> Wherewith to search the faces of the dead.<br></p>

<p>All I see is hilly Pavlovsk,<br> Meadow around, motionless water,<br> The most languid, the most shaded,<br> Most unforgettable spot.<br> <br> When you drive through the gates,<br> A blessed tremor takes you,<br> Not just living, you're mad, exultant,<br> Or alive in a different way.<br> <br> In late autumn it's fresh and biting,<br> Wandering breezes, joyful solitude.<br> Frosted white, the black fir-trees<br> Standing in melting snow.<br> <br> And filled with fiery delirium,<br> The dear voice rings out in song,<br> On the lyre-player's bronze shoulder,<br> Sits a bird with a scarlet breast.<br></p>

<p> Child, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken twig all the morning.<br> I smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig.<br> I am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour.<br> Perhaps you glance at me and think, "What a stupid game to spoil your morning with!"<br> Child, I have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies.<br> I seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver.<br> With whatever you find you create your glad games, I spend both my time and my strength over things I never can obtain.<br> In my frail canoe I struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that I too am playing a game.</p>

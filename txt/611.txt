<p>My hair had hardly covered my forehead. <br> I was picking flowers, playing by my door, <br> When you, my lover, on a bamboo horse, <br> Came trotting in circles and throwing green plums. <br> We lived near together on a lane in Ch'ang-kan, <br> Both of us young and happy-hearted. <br> <br> ...At fourteen I became your wife, <br> So bashful that I dared not smile, <br> And I lowered my head toward a dark corner <br> And would not turn to your thousand calls; <br> But at fifteen I straightened my brows and laughed, <br> Learning that no dust could ever seal our love, <br> That even unto death I would await you by my post <br> And would never lose heart in the tower of silent watching. <br> <br> ...Then when I was sixteen, you left on a long journey <br> Through the Gorges of Ch'u-t'ang, of rock and whirling water. <br> And then came the Fifth-month, more than I could bear, <br> And I tried to hear the monkeys in your lofty far-off sky. <br> Your footprints by our door, where I had watched you go, <br> Were hidden, every one of them, under green moss, <br> Hidden under moss too deep to sweep away. <br> And the first autumn wind added fallen leaves. <br> And now, in the Eighth-month, yellowing butterflies <br> Hover, two by two, in our west-garden grasses <br> And, because of all this, my heart is breaking <br> And I fear for my bright cheeks, lest they fade. <br> <br> ...Oh, at last, when you return through the three Pa districts, <br> Send me a message home ahead! <br> And I will come and meet you and will never mind the distance, <br> All the way to Chang-feng Sha. <br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Whispered, I am too young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, I am old enough;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore I threw a penny
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find out if I might love.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and love, go and love, young man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the lady be young and fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looped in the loops of her hair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, love is the crooked thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nobody wise enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find out all that is in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he would be thinking of love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the stars had run away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shadows eaten the moon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot begin it too soon.

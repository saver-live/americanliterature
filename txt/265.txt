<p>For Vasily Komarovsky<br> <br> Such strange words<br> That quiet April day brought me.<br> You knew it was still alive in me,<br> That dreadful week of passion.<br> <br> I heard no pealing of bells,<br> Floating in clear azure,<br> For seven days copper laughter chimed,<br> Silvery sorrow streamed.<br> <br> And I, veiling my face,<br> As if for eternal parting,<br> Lay, awaiting there<br> The still-nameless torment.<br></p>

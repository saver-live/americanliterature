ONE’S-SELF I sing—a simple, separate Person; 
Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-masse. 
  
Of Physiology from top to toe I sing; 
Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse—I say the
    Form complete is worthier far; 
The Female equally with the male I sing.
  
Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power, 
Cheerful—for freest action form’d, under the laws divine, 
The Modern Man I sing.

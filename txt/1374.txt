<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br> All mimsy were the borogoves,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
<p>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br> Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The frumious Bandersnatch!"</p>
<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Long time the manxome foe he sought--<br> So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;And stood awhile in thought.</p>
<p>And as in uffish thought he stood,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br> Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;And burbled as it came!</p>
<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br> He left it dead, and with its head<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;He went galumphing back.</p>
<p>"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br> O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;He chortled in his joy.</p>
<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br> All mimsy were the borogoves,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as memory, valour, and faith endure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let these stones witness, through the years to come,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How once there was a people fenced secure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind great waters girdling a far home.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their own and their lands youth ran side by side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heedless and headlong as their unyoked seas, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavish oer all, and set in stubborn pride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of judgment, nurtured by accepted peace.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, suddenly, war took them, seas and skies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joined with the earth for slaughter. In a breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, scoffing at all talk of sacrifice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave themselves without idle words to death.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thronging as cities throng to watch a game
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or their own herds move southward with the year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretly, swiftly, from their ports they came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that before half earth had heard their name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half earth had learned to speak of them with fear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of certain men who strove to reach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the red surf, the crest no man might hold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave their name for ever to a beach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which shall outlive Troys tale when Time is old;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of horsemen, gathered apart and hid, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merciless riders whom Megiddo sent forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the outflanking hour struck, and bid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them close and bar the drove-roads to the north;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who, when men feared the last March flood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Western war had risen beyond recall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stormed through the night from Amiens and made good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At their glad cost, the breach that perilled all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they returned to their desired land, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kindly cities and plains where they were bred, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having revealed their nation in earths sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as sacrifice and honour stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their own sun at the hushed hour shall light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shrine of these their dead!

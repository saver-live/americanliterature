&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your bark, O Birch-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your yellow bark, O Birch-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing by the rushing river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall and stately in the valley!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I a light canoe will build me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall float on the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a yellow leaf in Autumn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a yellow water-lily!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lay aside your cloak, O Birch-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay aside your white-skin wrapper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Summer-time is coming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun is warm in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you need no white-skin wrapper!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus aloud cried Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the solitary forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the rushing Taquamenaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the birds were singing gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Moon of Leaves were singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun, from sleep awaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started up and said, "Behold me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gheezis, the great Sun, behold me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tree with all its branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rustled in the breeze of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, with a sigh of patience,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my cloak, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his knife the tree he girdled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just beneath its lowest branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just above the roots, he cut it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the sap came oozing outward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the trunk, from top to bottom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheer he cleft the bark asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wooden wedge he raised it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your boughs, O Cedar!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your strong and pliant branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My canoe to make more steady,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make more strong and firm beneath me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the summit of the Cedar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went a sound, a cry of horror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went a murmur of resistance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it whispered, bending downward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Take my boughs, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down he hewed the boughs of cedar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaped them straightway to a framework,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like two bows he formed and shaped them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like two bended bows together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your roots, O Tamarack!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your fibrous roots, O Larch-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My canoe to bind together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to bind the ends together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the water may not enter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the river may not wet me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Larch, with all its fibres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shivered in the air of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched his forehead with its tassels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slid, with one long sigh of sorrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take them all, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the earth he tore the fibres,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tore the tough roots of the Larch-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closely sewed the bark together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound it closely to the frame-work.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your balm, O Fir-tree!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your balsam and your resin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to close the seams together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the water may not enter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the river may not wet me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Fir-tree, tall and sombre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobbed through all its robes of darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rattled like a shore with pebbles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered wailing, answered weeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my balm, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he took the tears of balsam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took the resin of the Fir-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smeared therewith each seam and fissure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made each crevice safe from water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All your quills, O Kagh, the Hedgehog!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make a necklace of them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a girdle for my beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And two stars to deck her bosom!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a hollow tree the Hedgehog
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his sleepy eyes looked at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot his shining quills, like arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying with a drowsy murmur,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the tangle of his whiskers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take my quills, O Hiawatha!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ground the quills he gathered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the little shining arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stained them red and blue and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the juice of roots and berries;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into his canoe he wrought them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round its waist a shining girdle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round its bows a gleaming necklace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its breast two stars resplendent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Birch Canoe was builded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley, by the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bosom of the forest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the forest's life was in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its mystery and its magic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the lightness of the birch-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the toughness of the cedar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the larch's supple sinews;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it floated on the river
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a yellow leaf in Autumn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a yellow water-lily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddles none had Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddles none he had or needed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his thoughts as paddles served him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his wishes served to guide him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift or slow at will he glided,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veered to right or left at pleasure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he called aloud to Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Help me clear this river
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its sunken logs and sand-bars."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight into the river Kwasind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged as if he were an otter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dived as if he were a beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood up to his waist in water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his arm-pits in the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swam and scouted in the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tugged at sunken logs and branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hands he scooped the sand-bars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his feet the ooze and tangle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus sailed my Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the rushing Taquamenaw,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed through all its bends and windings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed through all its deeps and shallows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swam the deeps, the shallows waded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and down the river went they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out among its islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleared its bed of root and sand-bar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragged the dead trees from its channel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made its passage safe and certain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a pathway for the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From its springs among the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the waters of Pauwating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the bay of Taquamenaw.

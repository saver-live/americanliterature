<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look not in my eyes, for fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They mirror true the sight I see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there you find your face too clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love it and be lost like me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One the long nights through must lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spent in star-defeated sighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why should you as well as I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perish? gaze not in my eyes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Grecian lad, as I hear tell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One that many loved in vain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked into a forest well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never looked away again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, when the turf in springtime flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With downward eye and gazes sad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands amid the glancing showers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jonquil, not a Grecian lad.

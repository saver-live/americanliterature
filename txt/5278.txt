<p>HE WAS lengthsman on the railway, and his station scarce deserved<br> That “pre-eminence in sorrow” of the Majesty he served,<br> But as dear to him and precious were the gifts reclaimed so soon—<br> Were the workman’s little daughters who were buried near Walloon.<br> <br> Speak their names in tones that linger, just as though you held them dear;<br> There are eyes to which the mention of those names will bring a tear.<br> Little Kate and Bridget, straying in an autumn afternoon,<br> Were attracted by the lilies in the water of Walloon.<br> <br> All is dark to us. The angels sing perhaps in Paradise<br> Of the younger sister’s danger, and the elder’s sacrifice;<br> But the facts were hidden from us, when the soft light from the moon<br> Glistened on the water-lilies o’er the Babies at Walloon.<br> <br> Ah! the children love the lilies, while we elders are inclined<br> To the flowers that have poison for the body and the mind.<br> Better for the “strongly human” to have done with life as soon,<br> Better perish for a lily like the Babies of Walloon.<br> <br> For they gather flowers early on the river far away,<br> Where the everlasting lilies keep their purity for aye,<br> And while summer brings our lilies to the run and the lagoon<br> May our children keep the legend of the Babies of Walloon.</p>

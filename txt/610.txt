<p>To wash and rinse our souls of their age-old sorrows,<br> We drained a hundred jugs of wine.<br> A splendid night it was . . . .<br> In the clear moonlight we were loath to go to bed,<br> But at last drunkenness overtook us;<br> And we laid ourselves down on the empty mountain,<br> The earth for pillow, and the great heaven for coverlet. <br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman's motive? shall we daub ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With finding roots for nettles? 'tis soft clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And easily explored. She had the means,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moneys, by the lady's liberal grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trust for that Australian scheme and me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which so, that she might clutch with both her hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chink to her naughty uses undisturbed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She served me (after all it was not strange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas only what my mother would have done)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A motherly, right damnable good turn.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, after. There are nettles everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But smooth green grasses are more common still;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue of heaven is larger than the cloud;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A miller's wife at Clichy took me in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spent her pity on me, made me calm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And merely very reasonably sad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found me a servant's place in Paris, where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to take the cast-off life again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood as quiet as a beaten ass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, having fallen through overloads, stands up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let them charge him with another pack.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few months, so. My mistress, young and light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was easy with me, less for kindness than
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she led, herself, an easy time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt her lover and her looking-glass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce knowing which way she was praised the most.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt so pretty and so pleased all day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not take the trouble to be cross,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes, as I stooped to tie her shoe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would tap me softly with her slender foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still restless with the last night's dancing in't,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And say 'Fie, pale-face! are you English girls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All grave and silent? mass-book still, and Lent?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And first-communion pallor on your cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Worn past the time for't? little fool, be gay!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which she vanished like a fairy, through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gap of silver laughter.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Came an hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all went otherwise. She did not speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But clenched her brows, and clipped me with her eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a viper with a pair of tongs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too far for any touch, yet near enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To view the writhing creature, then at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Stand still there, in the holy Virgin's name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thou Marian; thou'rt no reputable girl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Although sufficient dull for twenty saints!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I think thou mock'st me and my house,' she said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Confess thou'lt be a mother in a month,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thou mask of saintship.'


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Could I answer her?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light broke in so. It meant that then, that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not thought of that, in all my thoughts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the cold, numb aching of my brow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the heaving of impatient life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which threw me on death at intervals, through all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upbreak of the fountains of my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rains had swelled too large: it could mean that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did God make mothers out of victims, then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set such pure amens to hideous deeds?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not? He overblows an ugly grave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With violets which blossom in the spring.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I could be a mother in a month?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope it was not wicked to be glad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lifted up my voice and wept, and laughed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To heaven, not her, until it tore my throat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Confess, confess!' what was there to confess,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except man's cruelty, except my wrong?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except this anguish, or this ecstasy?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shame or glory? The light woman there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was small to take it in: an acorn-cup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would take the sea in sooner.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Good,' she cried;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Unmarried and a mother, and she laughs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These unchaste girls are always impudent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Get out, intriguer! leave my house and trot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I wonder you should look me in the face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With such a filthy secret.'


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I rolled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My scanty bundle up and went my way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washed white with weeping, shuddering head and foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blind hysteric passion, staggering forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond those doors. 'Twas natural of course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should not ask me where I meant to sleep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might sleep well beneath the heavy Seine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like others of my sort; the bed was laid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us. But any woman, womanly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had thought of him who should be in a month,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinless babe that should be in a month,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if by chance he might be warmer housed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than underneath such dreary dripping eaves."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I broke on Marian there. "Yet she herself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wife, I think, had scandals of her own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lover not her husband."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay," she said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But gold and meal are measured otherwise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt so much at school," said Marian Erle.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O crooked world," I cried, "ridiculous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not so lamentable! 'Tis the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these light women of a thrifty vice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Marian, always hard upon the rent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any sister's virtue! while they keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their own so darned and patched with perfidy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, though a rag itself, it looks as well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across a street, in balcony or coach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any perfect stuff might. For my part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd rather take the wind-side of the stews
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than touch such women with my finger-end!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They top the poor street-walker by their lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look the better for being so much worse:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's most devilish when respectable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you, dear, and your story."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is here," she said, and signed upon the child.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found a mistress-sempstress who was kind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me sew in peace among her girls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what was better than to draw the threads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day and half the night for him and him?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I lived for him, and so he lives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I know, by this time, God lives too."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled beyond the sun and ended so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my soul rose up to take her part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the world's successes, virtues, fames.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come with me, sweetest sister," I returned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And sit within my house and do me good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From henceforth, thou and thine! ye are my own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From henceforth. I am lonely in the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou art lonely, and the child is half
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An orphan. Come, and henceforth thou and I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being still together will not miss a friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor he a father, since two mothers shall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make that up to him. I am journeying south,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in my Tuscan home I'll find a niche
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set thee there, my saint, the child and thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burn the lights of love before thy face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever at thy sweet look cross myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From mixing with the world's prosperities;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That so, in gravity and holy calm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We two may live on toward the truer life."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked me in the face and answered not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor signed she was unworthy, nor gave thanks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But took the sleeping child and held it out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet my kiss, as if requiting me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trusting me at once. And thus, at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I carried him and her to where I live;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's there now, in the little room, asleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the soft child-breathing through the door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all three of us, at to-morrow's break,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass onward, homeward, to our Italy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Romney Leigh, I have your debts to pay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll be just and pay them.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yourself!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay your debts is scarcely difficult,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To buy your life is nearly impossible,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being sold away to Lamia. My head aches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see my road along this dark;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor can I creep and grope, as fits the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these foot-catching robes of womanhood:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man might walk a little . . . but I! He loves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lamia-woman, and I, write to him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What stops his marriage, and destroys his peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what perhaps shall simply trouble him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until she only need to touch his sleeve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just a finger's tremulous white flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying "Ah, Aurora Leigh! a pretty tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very pretty poet! I can guess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The motive" then, to catch his eye in hers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vow she does not wonder, and they two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To break in laughter as the sea along
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A melancholy coast, and float up higher,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a laugh, their fatal weeds of love!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, fatal, ay. And who shall answer me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fate has not hurried tides, and if to-night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My letter would not be a night too late,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arrow shot into a man that's dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove a vain intention? Would I show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new wife vile, to make the husband mad?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Lamia! shut the shutters, bar the doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From every glimmer on thy serpent-skin!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not let thy hideous secret out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To agonise the man I love I mean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friend I love . . . as friends love.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is strange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day while Marian told her story like
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To absorb most listeners, how I listened chief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a voice not hers, nor yet that enemy's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor God's in wrath, . . . but one that mixed with mine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long years ago among the garden-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said to me, to me too, "Be my wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora." It is strange with what a swell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of yearning passion, as a snow of ghosts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might beat against the impervious door of heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought, "Now, if I had been a woman, such
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As God made women, to save men by love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By just my love I might have saved this man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a nobler poem for the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than all I have failed in." But I failed besides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this; and now he's lost! through me alone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, by my only fault, his empty house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucks in, at this same hour, a wind from hell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep his hearth cold, make his casements creak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever to the tune of plague and sin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Romney, O my Romney, O my friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin and friend! my helper, when I would,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love, that might be! mine!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, how one weeps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one's too weary! Were a witness by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd say some folly . . . that I loved the man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows? . . . and make me laugh again for scorn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At strongest, women are as weak in flesh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men, at weakest, vilest, are in soul:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, hard for women to keep pace with men!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well give up at once, sit down at once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weep as I do. Tears, tears! why we weep?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis worth inquiry? that we've shamed a life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lost a love, or missed a world, perhaps?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By no means. Simply, that we've walked too far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or talked too much, or felt the wind i' the east,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we weep, as if both body and soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke up in water this way.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor mixed rags
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forsooth we're made of, like those other dolls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lean with pretty faces into fairs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as if I had a man in me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despising such a woman.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see a wrong or suffering moves us all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To undo it though we should undo ourselves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, all the more, that we undo ourselves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's womanly, past doubt, and not ill-moved.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A natural movement therefore, on my part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fill the chair up of my cousin's wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And save him from a devil's company!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're all so, made so 'tis our woman's trade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suffer torment for another's ease.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world's male chivalry has perished out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But women are knights-errant to the last;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if Cervantes had been Shakespeare too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had made his Don a Donna.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it clears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we rain our skies blue.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weakness. If, as I have just now said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man's within me, let him act himself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring the poor conscious trouble of blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's called the woman merely. I will write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plain words to England, if too late, too late,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ill-accounted, then accounted ill;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll trust the heavens with something.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Lord Howe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll find a story on another leaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Marian Erle, what noble friend of yours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She trusted once, through what flagitious means,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what disastrous ends; the story's true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found her wandering on the Paris quays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A babe upon her breast, unnatural,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseasonable outcast on such snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unthawed to this time. I will tax in this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your friendship, friend, if that convicted She
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be not his wife yet, to denounce the facts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To himself, but, otherwise, to let them pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tip-toe like escaping murderers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell my cousin merely Marian lives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is found, and finds her home with such a friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself, Aurora. Which good news, 'She's found,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will help to make him merry in his love:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I send it, tell him, for my marriage-gift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As good as orange-water for the nerves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perfumed gloves for headache, though aware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he, except of love, is scarcely sick:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean the new love this time, . . . since last year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such quick forgetting on the part of men!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is any shrewder trick upon the cards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enrich them? pray instruct me how 'tis done:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clubs, and while you look at clubs, 'tis spades;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's prodigy. The lightning strikes a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we think to find him dead and charred . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, there he is on a sudden, playing pipes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the splintered elm-tree! Crime and shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all their hoggery trample your smooth world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor leave more foot-marks than Apollo's kine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose hoofs were muffled by the thieving god
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tamarisk-leaves and myrtle. I'm so sad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So weary and sad to-night, I'm somewhat sour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me. To be blue and shrew at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceeds all toleration except yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yours, I know, is infinite. Farewell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow we take train for Italy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak gently of me to your gracious wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one, however far, shall yet be near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In loving wishes to your house."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sign.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I loose my heart upon a page,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lady Waldemar, I'm very glad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never liked you; which you knew so well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You spared me, in your turn, to like me much:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your liking surely had done worse for me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than has your loathing, though the last appears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficiently unscrupulous to hurt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not afraid of judgment. Now, there's space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between our faces, I stand off, as if
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I judged a stranger's portrait and pronounced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indifferently the type was good or bad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matter to me that the lines are false,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask you? did I ever ink my lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By drawing your name through them as a friend's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or touch your hands as lovers do? Thank God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never did: and since you're proved so vile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, vile, I say, we'll show it presently,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not obliged to nurse my friend in you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wash out my own blots, in counting yours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or even excuse myself to honest souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who seek to press my lip or clasp my palm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Alas, but Lady Waldemar came first!'


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis true, by this time you may near me so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you're my cousin's wife. You've gambled deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lucifer, and won the morning-star
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, and the noble house of Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must henceforth with its good roof shelter you:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot speak and burn you up between
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those rafters, I who am born a Leigh, nor speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pierce your breast through Romney's, I who live,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His friend and cousin, so, you're safe. You two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mus grow together like the tares and wheat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till God's great fire. But make the best of time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And hide this letter: let it speak no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I shall, how you tricked poor Marian Erle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set her own love digging its own grave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within her green hope's pretty garden-ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, sent her forth with some one of your sort
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a wicked house in France, from which she fled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With curses in her eyes and ears and throat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her whole soul choked with curses, mad in short,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And madly scouring up and down for weeks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign hedgeless country, lone and lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So innocent, male-fiends might slink within
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote hell-corners, seeing her so defiled.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you, you are a woman and more bold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do you justice, you'd not shrink to face . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll say, the unfledged life in the other room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, treading down God's corn, you trod in sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the dogs, in reach of all the guns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, Marian's babe, her poor unfathered child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her yearling babe! you'd face him when he wakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And opens up his wonderful blue eyes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd meet them and not wink perhaps, nor fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's triumph in them and supreme revenge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When righting His creation's balance-scale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You pulled as low as Tophet) to the top
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of most celestial innocence. For me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am not as bold, I own those infant eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have set me praying.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While they look at heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need of protestation in my words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the place you've made them! let them look.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll do your business with the heavens, be sure:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spare you common curses.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ponder this;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If haply you're the wife of Romney Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For which inheritance beyond your birth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sold that poisonous porridge called your soul),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I charge you, be his faithful and true wife!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep warm his hearth and clean his board, and, when
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaks, be quick with your obedience;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still grind your paltry wants and low desires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dust beneath his heel; though, even thus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground must hurt him, it was writ of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ye shall not yoke together ox and ass,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobler and ignobler. Ay, but you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall do your part as well as such ill things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can do aught good. You shall not vex him, mark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall not vex him, jar him when he's sad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or cross him when he's eager. Understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To trick him with apparent sympathies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor let him see thee in the face too near
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unlearn thy sweet seeming. Pay the price
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lies, by being constrained to lie on still:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis easy for thy sort: a million more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will scarcely damn thee deeper.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doing which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are very safe from Marian and myself;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll breathe as softly as the infant here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stir no dangerous embers. Fail a point,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show our Romney wounded, ill-content,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tormented in his home, we open mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a noise will follow, the last trump's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will scarcely seem more dreadful, even to you;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll have no pipers after: Romney will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I know him) push you forth as none of his,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other men declaring it well done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While women, even the worst, your like, will draw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their skirts back, not to brush you in the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I warn you. I'm . . . Aurora Leigh."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter written, I felt satisfied.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes, smouldering in me, were thrown out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By handfuls from me: I had writ my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wept my tears, and now was cool and calm;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, going straightway to the neighbouring room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lifted up the curtains of the bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Marian Erle, the babe upon her arm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both faces leaned together like a pair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of folded innocences self-complete,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each smiling from the other, smiled and slept.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seemed no sin, no shame, no wrath, no grief.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt she too had spoken words that night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But softer certainly, and said to God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who laughs in heaven perhaps that such as I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should make ado for such as she. "Defiled"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote? "defiled" I thought her? Stoop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoop lower, Aurora! get the angel's leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To creep in somewhere, humbly, on your knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this round of sequestration white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which they have wrapped earth's foundlings, heaven's elect.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day we took train to Italy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fled on southward in the roar of steam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marriage-bells of Romney must be loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sound so clear through all: I was not well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And truly, though the truth is like a jest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not choose but fancy, half the way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood alone i' the belfry, fifty bells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of naked iron, mad with merriment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As one who laughs and cannot stop himself),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All clanking at me, in me, over me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I shrieked a shriek I could not hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swooned with noise, but still, along my swoon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was 'ware the baffled changes backward rang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared, at each emerging sense, to beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crash it out with clangour. I was weak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I struggled for the posture of my soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In upright consciousness of place and time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But evermore, 'twixt waking and asleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slipped somehow, staggered, caught at Marian's eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment (it is very good for strength
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know that some one needs you to be strong),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so recovered what I called myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just knew it when we swept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the old roofs of Dijon: Lyons dropped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spark into the night, half trodden out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unseen. But presently the winding Rhone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washed out the moonlight large along his banks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which strained their yielding curves out clear and clean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold it, shadow of town and castle blurred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the hurrying river. Such an air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew thence upon the forehead half an air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half a water that I leaned and looked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, turning back on Marian, smiled to mark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she looked only on her child, who slept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face toward the moon too.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberal open country and the close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shot through tunnels, like a lightning-wedge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By great Thor-hammers driven through the rock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, quivering through the intestine blackness, splits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lets it in at once: the train swept in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athrob with effort, trembling with resolve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce denouncing whistle wailing on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dying off smothered in the shuddering dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we, self-awed, drew troubled breath, oppressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As other Titans underneath the pile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nightmare of the mountains. Out, at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch the dawn afloat upon the land!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hills, slung forth broadly and gauntly everywhere,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not cramped in their foundations, pushing wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich outspreads of the vineyards and the corn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As if they entertained i' the name of France),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While down their straining sides streamed manifest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soil as red as Charlemagne's knightly blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To consecrate the verdure. Some one said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marseilles!" And lo, the city of Marseilles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all her ships behind her, and beyond,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scimitar of ever-shining sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For right-hand use, bared blue against the sky!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night we spent between the purple heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And purple water: I think Marian slept;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I, as a dog a-watch for his master's foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cannot sleep or eat before he hears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat upon the deck and watched the night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listened through the stars for Italy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those marriage-bells I spoke of sounded far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some child's go-cart in the street beneath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a dying man who will not pass the day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knows it, holding by a hand he loves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too sat quiet, satisfied with death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat silent: I could hear my own soul speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had my friend, for Nature comes sometimes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And says, "I am ambassador for God."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt the wind soft from the land of souls;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old miraculous mountains heaved in sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One straining past another along the shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way of grand dull Odyssean ghosts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athirst to drink the cool blue wine of seas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stare on voyagers. Peak pushing peak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood: I watched, beyond that Tyrian belt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of intense sea betwixt them and the ship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down all their sides the misty olive-woods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolving in the weak, congenial moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still disclosing some brown convent tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems as if it grew from some brown rock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or many a little lighted village, dropped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a fallen star upon so high a point,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wonder what can keep it in its place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From sliding headlong with the waterfalls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which powder all the myrtle and orange groves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With spray of silver. Thus my Italy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was stealing on us. Genoa broke with day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Doria's long pale palace striking out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From green hills in advance of the white town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marble finger dominant to ships,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen glimmering through the uncertain grey of dawn.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I did not think, "My Italy,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought "My father!" O my father's house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without his presence! Places are too much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else too little, for immortal man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too little, when love's May o'ergrows the ground;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much, when that luxuriant robe of green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is rustling to our ankles in dead leaves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis only good to be or here or there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we had a dream on such a stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or this or that, but, once being wholly waked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And come back to the stone without the dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We trip upon't, alas, and hurt ourselves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else it falls on us and grinds us flat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heaviest gravestone on this burying earth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while I stood and mused, a quiet touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell light upon my arm, and, turning round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of moistened eyes convicted mine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, Marian! is the babe astir so soon?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He sleeps," she answered; "I have crept up thrice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seen you sitting, standing, still at watch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it did you good till now, but now" . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now," I said, "you leave the child alone."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you're alone," she answered, and she looked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I too were something. Sweet the help
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one we have helped! Thanks, Marian, for such help.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found a house at Florence on the hill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Bellosguardo. 'Tis a tower which keeps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A post of double observation o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That valley of Arno (holding as a hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outspread city) straight toward Fiesole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mount Morello and the setting sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vallombrosan mountains opposite,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which sunrise fills as full as crystal cups
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned red to the brim because their wine is red.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sun could die nor yet be born unseen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By dwellers at my villa: morn and eve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were magnified before us in the pure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illimitable space and pause of sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intense as angels' garments blanched with God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less blue than radiant. From the outer wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the garden, drops the mystic floating grey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of olive-trees (with interruptions green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From maize and vine), until 'tis caught and torn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the abrupt black line of cypresses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which signs the way to Florence. Beautiful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city lies along the ample vale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cathedral, tower and palace, piazza and street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river trailing like a silver cord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all, and curling loosely, both before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after, over the whole stretch of land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sown whitely up and down its opposite slopes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With farms and villas.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many weeks had passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No word was granted. Last, a letter came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Vincent Carrington: "My dear Miss Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've been as silent as a poet should,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any other man is sure to speak.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If sick, if vexed, if dumb, a silver piece
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will split a man's tongue, straight he speaks and says
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Received that cheque.' But you! . . . I send you funds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Paris, and you make no sign at all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, I'm responsible and wait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sign of you, Miss Leigh.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meantime your book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is eloquent as if you were not dumb;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And common critics, ordinarily deaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such fine meanings, and, like deaf men, loth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seem deaf, answering chance-wise, yes or no,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It must be' or 'it must not' (most pronounced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When least convinced), pronounce for once aright:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd think they really heard, and so they do . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burr of three or four who really hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And praise your book aright: Fame's smallest trump
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a great ear-trumpet for the deaf as posts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other being effective. Fear not, friend;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think here you have written a good book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you, a woman! It was in you yes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt 'twas in you: yet I doubted half
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that od-force of German Reichenbach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which still from female finger-tips burns blue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could strike out as our masculine white heats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quicken a man. Forgive me. All my heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is quick with yours since, just a fortnight since,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read your book and loved it.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will you love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife, too? Here's my secret I might keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month more from you! but I yield it up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I know you'll write the sooner for't,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most women (of your height even) counting love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's only serious business. Who's my wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall be in a month? you ask, nor guess?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember what a pair of topaz eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You once detected, turned against the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That morning in my London painting-room;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face half-sketched, and slurred; the eyes alone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you . . . you caught them up with yours, and said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Kate Ward's eyes, surely.' Now I own the truth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had thrown them there to keep them safe from Jove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would so naughtily find out their way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To both the heads of both my Danaës
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where just it made me mad to look at them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such eyes! I could not paint or think of eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those, and so I flung them into paint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned them to the wall's care. Ay, but now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've let them out, my Kate's: I've painted her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I change my style and leave mythologies),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole sweet face; it looks upon my soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a face on water, to beget itself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-length portrait, in a hanging cloak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one you wore once; 'tis a little frayed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pressed too for the nude harmonious arm;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she, she'd have her way, and have her cloak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said she could be like you only so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would not miss the fortune. Ah, my friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll write and say she shall not miss your love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through meeting mine? in faith, she would not change.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has your books by heart more than my words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quotes you up against me till I'm pushed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, three months since, her eyes were: nay, in fact,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought satisfied her but to make me paint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your last book folded in her dimpled hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of my brown palette as I wished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, grant me, the presentment had been newer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She'd grant me nothing: I compounded for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The naming of the wedding-day next month,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gladly too. 'Tis pretty to remark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How women can love women of your sort,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tie their hearts with love-knots to your feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow insolent about you against men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put us down by putting up the lip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a man there are such, let us own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who write not ill remains a man, poor wretch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you ! Write weaker than Aurora Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there'll be women who believe of you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Besides my Kate) that if you walked on sand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would not leave a foot-print.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you put
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wonder by my marriage, like poor Leigh?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Kate Ward!' he said. 'Kate Ward!' he said anew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I thought . . .' he said, and stopped 'I did not think . . .'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he dropped to silence.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, he's changed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not seen him, you're aware, for long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But went of course. I have not touched on this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all this letter conscious of your heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And writing lightlier for the heavy fact,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As clocks are voluble with lead.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How poor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say I'm sorry! dear Leigh, dearest Leigh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those old days of Shropshire pardon me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he and you fought many a field of gold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On what you should do, or you should not do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make bread or verses (it just came to that),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought you'd one day draw a silken peace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a golden ring. I thought so: foolishly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event proved; for you went more opposite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To each other, month by month, and year by year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this happened. God knows best, we say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hoarsely. When the fever took him first,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just after I had writ to you in France,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tell me, Lady Waldemar mixed drinks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And counted grains, like any salaried nurse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excepting that she wept too. Then Lord Howe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're right about Lord Howe, Lord Howe's a trump,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, with such in his hand, a man like Leigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May lose as he does. There's an end to all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, even this letter, though this second sheet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May find you doubtful. Write a word for Kate:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reads my letters always, like a wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if she sees her name I'll see her smile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And share the luck. So, bless you, friend of two!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not ask you what your feeling is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Florence with my pictures; I can hear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your heart a-flutter over the snow-hills:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, just to pace the Pitti with you once,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd give a half-hour of to-morrow's walk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Kate . . . I think so. Vincent Carrington."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noon was hot; the air scorched like the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was shut out. The closed persiani threw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their long-scored shadows on my villa-floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And interlined the golden atmosphere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight, still, across the pictures on the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statuette on the console (of young Love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Psyche made one marble by a kiss),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low couch where I leaned, the table near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vase of lilies Marian pulled last night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Each green leaf and each white leaf ruled in black
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if for writing some new text of fate),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the open letter, rested on my knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there the lines swerved, trembled, though I sat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untroubled, plainly, reading it again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three times. Well, he's married; that is clear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder that he's married, nor much more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Vincent's therefore "sorry." Why, of course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady nursed him when he was not well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixed drinks, unless nepenthe was the drink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas scarce worth telling. But a man in love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will see the whole sex in his mistress' hood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prettier for its lining of fair rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he catches back and says at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sorry." Sorry. Lady Waldemar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At prettiest, under the said hood, preserved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From such a light as I could hold to her face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To flare its ugly wrinkles out to shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is scarce a wife for Romney, as friends judge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurora Leigh or Vincent Carrington,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's plain. And if he's "conscious of my heart" . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be natural, though the phrase is strong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(One's apt to use strong phrases, being in love);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even that stuff of "fields of gold," "gold rings,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what he "thought," poor Vincent, what he "thought,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May never mean enough to ruffle me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, this room stifles. Better burn than choke;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best have air, air, although it comes with fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throw open blinds and windows to the noon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take a blister on my brow instead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this dead weight! best, perfectly be stunned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By those insufferable cicale, sick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hoarse with rapture of the summer-heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sing, like poets, till their hearts break, sing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till men say "It's too tedious."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Books succeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lives fail. Do I feel it so, at last?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate loves a worn-out cloak for being like mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I live self-despised for being myself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yearn toward some one else, who yearns away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what he is, in his turn. Strain a step
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever, yet gain no step? Are we such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot, with our admirations even,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tip-toe aspirations, touch a thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's higher than we? is all a dismal flat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God alone above each, as the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er level lagunes, to make them shine and stink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laying stress upon us with immediate flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we respond with our miasmal fog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And call it mounting higher because we grow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More highly fatal?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tush, Aurora Leigh!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wear your sackcloth looped in Cæsar's way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brag your failings as mankind's. Be still.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is what's higher, in this very world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than you can live, or catch at. Stand aside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look at others instance little Kate!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She'll make a perfect wife for Carrington.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She always has been looking round the earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For something good and green to alight upon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nestle into, with those soft-winged eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsiding now beneath his manly hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twixt trembling lids of inexpressive joy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not scorn her, after all, too much,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That so much she should love me: a wise man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can pluck a leaf, and find a lecture in't;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, too, . . . God has made me, I've a heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's capable of worship, love, and loss;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say the same of Shakespeare's. I'll be meek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learn to reverence, even this poor myself.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book, too pass it. "A good book," says he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you a woman." I had laughed at that,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But long since. I'm a woman, it is true;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, and woe to us, when we feel it most!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, least care have we for the crowns and goals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And compliments on writing our good books.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book has some truth in it, I believe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And truth outlives pain, as the soul does life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we talk our Phædons to the end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the dismal faces that we make,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erwrinkled with dishonouring agony
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From decomposing drugs. I have written truth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I a woman, feebly, partially,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inaptly in presentation, Romney'll add,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a woman. For the truth itself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's neither man's nor woman's, but just God's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None else has reason to be proud of truth:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself will see it sifted, disenthralled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kept upon the height and in the light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as and no farther than 'tis truth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, now He has left off calling firmaments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strata, flowers and creatures, very good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says it still of truth, which is His own.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth, so far, in my book; the truth which draws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all things upwards that a twofold world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must go to a perfect cosmos. Natural things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spiritual, who separates those two
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In art, in morals, or the social drift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears up the bond of nature and brings death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paints futile pictures, writes unreal verse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leads vulgar days, deals ignorantly with men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is wrong, in short, at all points. We divide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This apple of life, and cut it through the pips:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect round which fitted Venus' hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has perished as utterly as if we ate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both halves. Without the spiritual, observe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural's impossible no form,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No motion: without sensuous, spiritual
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is inappreciable, no beauty or power:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this twofold sphere the twofold man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For still the artist is intensely a man)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holds firmly by the natural, to reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual beyond it, fixes still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type with mortal vision, to pierce through,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes immortal, to the antitype
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some call the ideal, better called the real,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certain to be called so presently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When things shall have their names. Look long enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On any peasant's face here, coarse and lined,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll catch Antinous somewhere in that clay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As perfect featured as he yearns at Rome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From marble pale with beauty; then persist,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if your apprehension's competent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll find some fairer angel at his back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much exceeding him as he the boor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pushing him with empyreal disdain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever out of sight. Ay, Carrington
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is glad of such a creed: an artist must,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who paints a tree, a leaf, a common stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just his hand, and finds it suddenly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-piece with and conterminous to his soul.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why else do these things move him, leaf or stone?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird's not moved that pecks at a springshoot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet the horse, before a quarry a-graze:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But man, the twofold creature, apprehends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twofold manner, in and outwardly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing in the world comes single to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mere itself, cup, column, or candlestick,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All patterns of what shall be in the Mount;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole temporal show related royally,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And built up to eterne significance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the open arms of God. "There's nothing great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor small," has said a poet of our day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose voice will ring beyond the curfew of eve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not be thrown out by the matin's bell:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And truly, I reiterate, nothing's small!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No lily-muffled hum of a summer-bee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But finds some coupling with the spinning stars;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pebble at your foot, but proves a sphere;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No chaffinch, but implies the cherubim;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And (glancing on my own thin, veinèd wrist)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a little tremor of the blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole strong clamour of a vehement soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth utter itself distinct. Earth's crammed with heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every common bush afire with God;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only he who sees, takes off his shoes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And daub their natural faces unaware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more from the first similitude.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth, so far, in my book! a truth which draws
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all things upward. I, Aurora, still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have felt it hound me through the wastes of life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Jove did Io; and, until that Hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall overtake me wholly and on my head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay down its large unfluctuating peace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feverish gad-fly pricks me up and down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be. Art's the witness of what Is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind this show. If this world's show were all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then imitation would be all in Art;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, Jove's hand gripes us! For we stand here, we,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If genuine artists, witnessing for God's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete, consummate, undivided work;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That every natural flower which grows on earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implies a flower upon the spiritual side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantial, archetypal, all aglow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blossoming causes, not so far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we, whose spirit-sense is somewhat cleared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May catch at something of the bloom and breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too vaguely apprehended, though indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still apprehended, consciously or not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still transferred to picture, music, verse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thrilling audient and beholding souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By signs and touches which are known to souls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How known, they know not, why, they cannot find,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So straight call out on genius, say "A man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Produced this," when much rather they should say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis insight and he saw this."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus is Art
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-magnified in magnifying a truth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, fully recognised, would change the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shift its morals. If a man could feel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one day, in the artist's ecstasy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every day, feast, fast, or working-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual significance burn through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hieroglyphic of material shows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforward he would paint the globe with wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reverence fish and fowl, the bull, the tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even his very body as a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which now he counts so vile, that all the towns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make offal of their daughters for its use,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On summer-nights, when God is sad in heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think what goes on in His recreant world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made quite other; while that moon He made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shine there, at the first love's covenant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines still, convictive as a marriage-ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before adulterous eyes.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sure it is,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, if we say a true word, instantly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel 'tis God's, not ours, and pass it on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like bread at sacrament we taste and pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor handle for a moment, as indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We dared to set up any claim to such!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I my poem, let my readers talk.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm closer to it I can speak as well:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll say with Romney, that the book is weak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range uneven, the points of sight obscure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music interrupted.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of woman (or of man, I think)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not a book. Alas, the best of books
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is but a word in Art, which soon grows cramped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiff, dubious-statured with the weight of years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drops an accent or digamma down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cranny of unfathomable time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the critic's reaching. Art itself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've called the larger life, must feel the soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live past it. For more's felt than is perceived,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more's perceived than can be interpreted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love strikes higher with his lambent flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Art can pile the faggots.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it so?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jove's hand meets us with composing touch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when at last we are hushed and satisfied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Io does not call it truth, but love?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, well! my father was an Englishman:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother's blood in me is not so strong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should bear this stress of Tuscan noon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep my wits. The town, there, seems to seethe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Medæan boil-pot of the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the patient hills are bubbling round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a prick would leave them flat. Does heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep far off, not to set us in a blaze?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so, let drag your fiery fringes, heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burn us up to quiet. Ah, we know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much here, not to know what's best for peace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have too much light here, not to want more fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To purify and end us. We talk, talk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclude upon divine philosophies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And get the thanks of men for hopeful books,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat we take our own life up, and . . . pshaw!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we piece it with another's life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A yard of silk to carry out our lawn)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well suppose my little handkerchief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would cover Samminiato, church and all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If out I threw it past the cypresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, in this ragged, narrow life of mine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contain my own conclusions.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll shut up the persiani and sit down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when my head's done aching, in the cool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write just a word to Kate and Carrington.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May joy be with them! she has chosen well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he not ill.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be glad, I think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for Romney. Had he married Kate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I surely, surely, should be very glad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Florence sits upon me easily,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With native air and tongue. My graves are calm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not too much hurt me. Marian's good,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle and loving, lets me hold the child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or drags him up the hills to find me flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fill these vases ere I'm quite awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandiose red tulips, which grow wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Dante's purple lilies, which he blew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a larger bubble with his prophet breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or one of those tall flowering reeds that stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Arno, like a sheaf of sceptres left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By some remote dynasty of dead gods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suck the stream for ages and get green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blossom wheresoe'er a hand divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had warmed the place with ichor. Such I find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At early morning laid across my bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wake up pelted with a childish laugh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which even Marian's low precipitous "hush"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has vainly interposed to put away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I, with shut eyes, smile and motion for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dewy kiss that's very sure to come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From mouth and cheeks, the whole child's face at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolved on mine, as if a nosegay burst
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its string with the weight of roses overblown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropped upon me. Surely I should be glad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little creature almost loves me now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And calls my name, "Alola," stripping off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The r's like thorns, to make it smooth enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take between his dainty, milk-fed lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God love him! I should certainly be glad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except, God help me, that I'm sorrowful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Romney.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romney, Romney! Well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grows absurd! too like a tune that runs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I' the head, and forces all things in the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind, rain, the creaking gnat, or stuttering fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sing itself and vex you, yet perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A paltry tune you never fairly liked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some "I'd be a butterfly," or "C'est l'amour:"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're made so, not such tyrants to ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still we are slaves to nature. Some of us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are turned, too, overmuch like some poor verse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a trick of ritournelle: the same thing goes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And comes back ever.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vincent Carrington
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is "sorry," and I'm sorry; but he's strong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mount from sorrow to his heaven of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he says at moments, "Poor, poor Leigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who'll never call his own so true a heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fair a face even," he must quickly lose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of pity, in the blush he makes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his very pitying eyes. The snow, for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has fallen in May and finds the whole earth warm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And melts at the first touch of the green grass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Romney, he has chosen, after all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he had as excellent a sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see by, as most others, and perhaps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has scarce seen really worse than some of us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all's said. Let him pass. I'm not too much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman, not to be a man for once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bury all my Dead like Alaric,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depositing the treasures of my soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this drained watercourse, then letting flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river of life again with commerce-ships
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pleasure-barges full of silks and songs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow, winds, and help us.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, we mock ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With talking of the winds; perhaps as much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With other resolutions. How it weighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hot, sick air! and how I covet here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dead's provision on the river-couch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With silver curtains drawn on tinkling rings!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else their rest in quiet crypts, laid by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From heat and noise; from those cicale, say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this more vexing heart-beat.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We covet for the soul, the body's part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To die and rot. Even so, Aurora, ends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aspiration who bespoke our place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far in the east. The occidental flats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had fed us fatter, therefore? we have climbed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where herbage ends? we want the beast's part now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tire of the angel's? Men define a man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature who stands frontward to the stars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature who looks inward to himself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tool-wright, laughing creature. 'Tis enough:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll say instead, the inconsequent creature, man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that's his specialty. What creature else
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceives the circle, and then walks the square?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loves things proved bad, and leaves a thing proved good?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think the bee makes honey half a year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To loathe the comb in winter and desire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little ant's food rather? But a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note men! they are but women after all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As women are but Auroras! there are men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born tender, apt to pale at a trodden worm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who paint for pastime, in their favourite dream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spruce auto-vestments flowered with crocus-flames.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, too, who believe in hell, and lie;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, too, who believe in heaven, and fear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, who waste their souls in working out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's problem on these sands betwixt two tides,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concluding, "Give us the oyster's part, in death."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, long-suffering and most patient God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou needst be surelier God to bear with us
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than even to have made us! thou aspire, aspire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From henceforth for me! thou who hast thyself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endured this fleshhood, knowing how as a soaked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sucking vesture it can drag us down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And choke us in the melancholy Deep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustain me, that with thee I walk these waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resisting! breathe me upward, thou in me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspiring who art the way, the truth, the life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That no truth henceforth seem indifferent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No way to truth laborious, and no life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even this life I live, intolerable!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days went by. I took up the old days,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all their Tuscan pleasures worn and spoiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some lost book we dropped in the long grass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such a happy summer-afternoon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When last we read it with a loving friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And find in autumn when the friend is gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass cut short, the weather changed, too late,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stare at, as at something wonderful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sorrow, thinking how two hands before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had held up what is left to only one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how we smiled when such a vehement nail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impressed the tiny dint here which presents
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This verse in fire for ever. Tenderly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mournfully I lived. I knew the birds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And insects, which looked fathered by the flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And emulous of their hues: I recognised
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moths, with that great overpoise of wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which make a mystery of them how at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can stop flying: butterflies, that bear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon their blue wings such red embers round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to scorch the blue air into holes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each flight they take: and fire-flies, that suspire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short soft lapses of transported flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the tingling Dark, while overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constant and inviolable stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outburn those light-of-love: melodious owls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(If music had but one note and was sad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould sound just so), and all the silent swirl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of bats that seem to follow in the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some grand circumference of a shadowy dome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which we are blind: and then the nightingales,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which pluck our heart across a garden-wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(When walking in the town) and carry it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So high into the bowery almond trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tremble and are afraid, and feel as if
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden flood of moonlight unaware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolved the pillars of the steady earth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made it less substantial. And I knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harmless opal snakes, the large-mouthed frogs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Those noisy vaunters of their shallow streams);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lizards, the green lightnings of the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, if you sit down quiet, nor sigh loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will flatter you and take you for a stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flash familiarly about your feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such prodigious eyes in such small heads!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew them (though they had somewhat dwindled from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My childish imagery), and kept in mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How last I sat among them equally,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fellowship and mateship, as a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feels equall still toward insect, beast, and bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Adam in him has forgone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All privilege of Eden, making friends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talk with such a bird or such a goat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buying many a two-inch-wide rush-cage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let out the caged cricket on a tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying "Oh, my dear grillino, were you cramped?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are you happy with the ilex-leaves?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you love me who have let you go?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say yes in singing, and I'll understand."


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the creatures all seemed farther off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer mine, nor like me, only there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gulf between us. I could yearn indeed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other rich men, for a drop of dew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cool this heat, a drop of the early dew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irrecoverable child-innocence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Before the heart took fire and withered life)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When childhood might pair equally with birds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now . . . the birds were grown too proud for us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, the very sun forbids the dew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, I had come back to an empty nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which every bird's too wise for. How I heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father's step on that deserted ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice along that silence, as he told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of bird and insect, tree and flower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the presentations of the stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across Valdarno, interposing still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child," "my child." When fathers say "my child,"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis easier to conceive the universe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life's transitions down the steps of law.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rode once to the little mountain-house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fast as if to find my father there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, when in sight of't, within fifty yards,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dropped my horse's bridle on his neck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And paused upon his flank. The house's front
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was cased with lingots of ripe Indian corn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tessellated order and device
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of golden patterns, not a stone of wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncovered, not an inch of room to grow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vine-leaf. The old porch had disappeared;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And right in the open doorway sat a girl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At plaiting straws, her black hair strained away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a scarlet kerchief caught beneath her chin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tuscan fashion, her full ebon eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which looked too heavy to be lifted so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still dropped and lifted toward the mulberry-tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which the lads were busy with their staves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shout and laughter, stripping every bough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As bare as winter, of those summer leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father had not changed for all the silk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which the ugly silkworms hide themselves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough. My horse recoiled before my heart;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned the rein abruptly. Back we went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fast, to Florence.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was trial enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of graves. I would not visit, if I could,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father's, or my mother's any more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see if stone cutter or lichen beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So early in the race, or throw my flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which could not out-smell heaven or sweeten earth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They live too far above, that I should look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far below to find them: let me think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rather they are visiting my grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called life here (undeveloped yet to life),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that they drop upon me, now and then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For token or for solace, some small weed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Least odorous of the growths of paradise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spare such pungent scents as kill with joy.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My old Assunta, too, was dead, was dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O land of all men's past! for me alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not mix its tenses. I was past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed, like others, only not in heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a Tuscan eve I wandered down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cypress alley like a restless ghost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tries its feeble ineffectual breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its own charred funeral-brands put out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too soon, where black and stiff stood up the trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the broad vermilion of the skies.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such skies! all clouds abolished in a sweep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of God's skirt, with a dazzle to ghosts and men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As down I went, saluting on the bridge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hem of such before't was caught away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the peaks of Lucca. Underneath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river, just escaping from the weight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that intolerable glory, ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In acquiescent shadow murmurously;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, up beside it, streamed the festa-folk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fellow-murmurs from their feet and fans,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And issimo and ino and sweet poise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of vowels in their pleasant scandalous talk;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning from the grand-duke's dairy-farm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the trees grew dangerous at eight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For "trust no tree by moonlight," Tuscans say),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To eat their ice at Donay's tenderly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each lovely lady close to a cavalier
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who holds her dear fan while she feeds her smile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On meditative spoonfuls of vanille
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listens to his hot-breathed vows of love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough to thaw her cream and scorch his beard.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas little matter. I could pass them by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indifferently, not fearing to be known.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No danger of being wrecked upon a friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forced to take an iceberg for an isle!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very English, here, must wait and learn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hang the cobweb of their gossip out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To catch a fly. I'm happy. It's sublime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This perfect solitude of foreign lands!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be, as if you had not been till then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And were then, simply that you chose to be:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spring up, not be brought forth from the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like grasshoppers at Athens, and skip thrice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a woman makes a pounce on you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plants you in her hair! possess, yourself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new world all alive with creatures new,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sun, new moon, new flowers, new people ah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be possessed by none of them! no right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one, to call your name, inquire your where,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what you think of Mister Someone's book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Mister Other's marriage or decease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or how's the headache which you had last week,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or why you look so pale still, since it's gone?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such most surprising riddance of one's life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes next one's death; 'tis disembodiment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the pang. I marvel, people choose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stand stock-still like fakirs, till the moss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows on them and they cry out, self-admired,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How verdant and how virtuous!" Well, I'm glad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or should be, if grown foreign to myself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As surely as to others.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musing so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked the narrow unrecognising streets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where many a palace-front peers gloomily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through stony vizors iron-barred (prepared
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike, should foe or lover pass that way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For guest or victim), and came wandering out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the churches with mild open doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plaintive wail of vespers, where a few,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those chiefly women, sprinkled round in blots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the dusky pavement, knelt and prayed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the altar's silver glory. Oft a ray
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I liked to sit and watch) would tremble out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just touch some face more lifted, more in need
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Of course a woman's), while I dreamed a tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fit its fortunes. There was one who looked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the earth had suddenly grown too large
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a little humpbacked thing as she;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pitiful black kerchief round her neck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sole proof she had had a mother. One, again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked sick for love, seemed praying some soft saint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put more virtue in the new fine scarf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spent a fortnight's meals on, yesterday,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cruel Gigi might return his eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Giuliana. There was one, so old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So old, to kneel grew easier than to stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So solitary, she accepts at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Lady for her gossip, and frets on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the sinful world which goes its rounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In marrying and being married, just the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when 'twas almost good and had the right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Her Gian alive, and she herself eighteen).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And yet, now even, if Madonna willed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She'd win a tern in Thursday's lottery
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And better all things. Did she dream for nought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, boiling cabbage for the fast-day's soup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It smelt like blessèd entrails? such a dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nought? would sweetest Mary cheat her so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lose that certain candle, straight and white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any fair grand-duchess in her teens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which otherwise should flare here in a week?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benigna sis, thou beauteous Queen of Heaven!"


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat there musing, and imagining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such utterance from such faces: poor blind souls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That writhe toward heaven along the devil's trail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, I thought, but He may stretch His hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pick them up? 'tis written in the Book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heareth the young ravens when they cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet they cry for carrion. O my God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we, who make excuses for the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do it in our measure. Then I knelt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropped my head upon the pavement too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prayed, since I was foolish in desire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other creatures, craving offal-food,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That He would stop His ears to what I said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only listen to the run and beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this poor, passionate, helpless blood


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lay, and spoke not: but He heard in heaven.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many Tuscan evenings passed the same.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not lose a sunset on the bridge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would not miss a vigil in the church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And liked to mingle with the outdoor crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So strange and gay and ignorant of my face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For men you know not are as good as trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only once, at the Santissima,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost chanced upon a man I knew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Blaise Delorme. He saw me certainly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And somewhat hurried, as he crossed himself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoothness of the action, then half bowed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only half, and merely to my shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slipped so quick behind the porphyry plinth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him dubious if 'twas really I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or peradventure Satan's usual trick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep a mounting saint uncanonised.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was safe for that time, and I too;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argent angels in the altar-flare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absorbed his soul next moment. The good man!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England we were scarce acquaintances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That here in Florence he should keep my thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the image on his eye, which came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went: and yet his thought disturbed my life:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, after that, I oftener sat at home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On evenings, watching how they fined themselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With gradual conscience to a perfect night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the moon, diminished to a curve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay out there like a sickle for His hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cometh down at last to reap the earth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At such times, ended seemed my trade of verse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feared to jingle bells upon my robe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the four-faced silent cherubim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With God so near me, could I sing of God?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not write, nor read, nor even think,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sat absorbed amid the quickening glooms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like some passive broken lump of salt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropped in by chance to a bowl of oenomel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spoil the drink a little and lose itself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolving slowly, slowly, until lost.

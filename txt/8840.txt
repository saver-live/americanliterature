<p><b>I.</b><br> SOME busy hands have brought to light,<br> And laid beneath my eye,<br> The dress I wore that afternoon<br> You came to say good-by.<br> <br> About it still there seems to cling<br> Some fragrance unexpressed,<br> The ghostly odor of the rose<br> I wore upon my breast;<br> <br> And, subtler than all flower-scent,<br> The sacred garment holds<br> The memory of that parting day<br> Close hidden in its folds.<br> <br> The rose is dead, and you are gone,<br> But to the dress I wore<br> The rose's smell, the thought of you,<br> Are wed forevermore.<br> <br> <b>II.</b><br> That day you came to say good-by<br> (A month ago! It seems a year!)<br> How calm I was! I met your eye,<br> And in my own you saw no tear.<br> <br> You heard me laugh and talk and jest,<br> And lightly grieve that you should go;<br> You saw the rose upon my breast,<br> But not the breaking heart below.<br> <br> And when you came and took my hand,<br> It scarcely fluttered in your hold.<br> Alas, you did not understand!<br> For you were blind, and I was cold.<br> <br> And now you cannot see my tears,<br> And now you cannot hear my cry.<br> A month ago? Nay, years and years<br> Have aged my heart since that good-by.</p>

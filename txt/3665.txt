<pre>
The clothes-line is a Rosary
Of household help and care;
Each little saint the Mother loves
Is represented there.

And when across her garden plot
She walks, with thoughtful heed,
I should not wonder if she told
Each garment for a bead.

A stranger passing, I salute
The Household in its wear,
And smile to think how near of kin
Are love and toil and prayer.

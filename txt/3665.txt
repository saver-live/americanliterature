<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is my team ploughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I was used to drive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear the harness jingle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was man alive?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, the horses trample,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harness jingles now;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No change though you lie under
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land you used to plough.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is football playing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the river shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lads to chase the leather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I stand up no more?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, the ball is flying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lads play heart and soul;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal stands up, the keeper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands up to keep the goal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is my girl happy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I thought hard to leave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has she tired of weeping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she lies down at eve?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, she lies down lightly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lies not down to weep:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your girl is well contented.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be still, my lad, and sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is my friend hearty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am thin and pine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has he found to sleep in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better bed than mine?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, lad, I lie easy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lie as lads would choose;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cheer a dead man's sweetheart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never ask me whose.

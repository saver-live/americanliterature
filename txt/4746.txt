<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed be the English and all their ways and works.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed be the Infidels, Hereticks, and Turks!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen, quo Jobson, but where I used to lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was neither Candle, Bell nor Book to curse my brethren by,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a palm-tree in full bearing, bowing down, bowing down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a surf that drove unsparing at the brown, walled town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conches in a temple, oil-lamps in a dome,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a low moon out of Africa said: This way home!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed be the English and all that they profess.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed be the Savages that prance in nakedness!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen, quo Jobson, but where I used to lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was neither shirt nor pantaloons to catch my brethren by:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a well-wheel slowly creaking, going round, going round,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a water-channel leaking over drowned, warm ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parrots very busy in the trellised pepper-vine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a high sun over Asia shouting: Rise and shine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessèd be the English and everything they own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed be the Infidels that bow to wood and stone!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen, quo Jobson, but where I used to lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was neither pew nor Gospelleer to save my brethren by:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a desert stretched and stricken, left and right, left and right,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the piled mirages thicken under white-hot light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skull beneath a sand-hill and a viper coiled inside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a red wind out of Libya roaring: Run and hide!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessèd be the English and all they make or do.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursèd be the Hereticks who doubt that this is true!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen, quo Jobson, but where I mean to die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is neither rule nor calliper to judge the matter by:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Himalaya heavenward-heading, sheer and vast, sheer and vast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a million summits bedding on the last worlds past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain sacred mountain where the scented cedars climb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the feet of my Beloved hurrying back through Time!

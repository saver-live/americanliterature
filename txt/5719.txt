<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn, turn, my wheel?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn round and round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a pause, without a sound:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spins the flying world away!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clay, well mixed with marl and sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follows the motion of my hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far some must follow, and some command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all are made of clay!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus sang the Potter at his task
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the blossoming hawthorn-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While o'er his features, like a mask,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quilted sunshine and leaf-shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved, as the boughs above him swayed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clothed him, till he seemed to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure woven in tapestry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sumptuously was he arrayed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that magnificent attire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sable tissue flaked with fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a magician he appeared,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conjurer without book or beard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while he plied his magic art--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it was magical to me--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood in silence and apart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wondered more and more to see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shapeless, lifeless mass of clay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise up to meet the master's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now contract and now expand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even his slightest touch obey;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ever in a thoughtful mood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sang his ditty, and at times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistled a tune between the rhymes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a melodious interlude.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn, turn, my wheel!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things must change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To something new, to something strange;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing that is can pause or stay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon will wax, the moon will wane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mist and cloud will turn to rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain to mist and cloud again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow be to-day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus still the Potter sang, and still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By some unconscious act of will,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody and even the words
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were intermingled with my thought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As bits of colored thread are caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And woven into nests of birds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus to regions far remote,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the ocean's vast expanse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wizard in the motley coat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transported me on wings of song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the northern shores of France
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore me with restless speed along.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What land is this that seems to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mingling of the land and sea?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land of sluices, dikes, and dunes?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This water-net, that tessellates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landscape? this unending maze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gardens, through whose latticed gates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imprisoned pinks and tulips gaze;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in long summer afternoons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunshine, softened by the haze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes streaming down as through a screen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where over fields and pastures green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painted ships float high in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over all and everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sails of windmills sink and soar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like wings of sea-gulls on the shore?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What land is this? Yon pretty town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Delft, with all its wares displayed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride, the market-place, the crown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And centre of the Potter's trade.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See! every house and room is bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With glimmers of reflected light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From plates that on the dresser shine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flagons to foam with Flemish beer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sparkle with the Rhenish wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pilgrim flasks with fleurs-de-lis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ships upon a rolling sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tankards pewter topped, and queer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With comic mask and musketeer!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each hospitable chimney smiles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A welcome from its painted tiles;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parlor walls, the chamber floors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stairways and the corridors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The borders of the garden walks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are beautiful with fadeless flowers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never droop in winds or showers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never wither on their stalks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn, turn, my wheel!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All life is brief;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What now is bud wilt soon be leaf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What now is leaf will soon decay;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blows east, the wind blows west;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue eyes in the robin's nest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will soon have wings and beak and breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flutter and fly away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now southward through the air I glide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song my only pursuivant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see across the landscape wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue Charente, upon whose tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belfries and the spires of Saintes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripple and rock from side to side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, when an earthquake rends its walls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crumbling city reels and falls.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is it in the suburbs here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Potter, working with such cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this mean house, this mean attire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His manly features bronzed with fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose figulines and rustic wares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce find him bread from day to day?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This madman, as the people say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who breaks his tables and his chairs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed his furnace fires, nor cares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who goes unfed if they are fed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor who may live if they are dead?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This alchemist with hollow cheeks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sunken, searching eyes, who seeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mingled earths and ores combined
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With potency of fire, to find
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some new enamel, hard and bright,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dream, his passion, his delight?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Palissy! within thy breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned the hot fever of unrest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine was the prophets vision, thine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exultation, the divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insanity of noble minds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never falters nor abates,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But labors and endures and waits,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all that it foresees it finds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what it cannot find creates!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn, turn, my wheel!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This earthen jar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch can make, a touch can mar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shall it to the Potter say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makest thou.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast no hand?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men who think to understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A world by their Creator planned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wiser is than they.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still guided by the dreamy song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in a trance I float along
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the Pyrenean chain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the fields and farms of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the bright Majorcan isle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lends its softened name to art,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spot, a dot upon the chart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose little towns, red-roofed with tile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are ruby-lustred with the light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of blazing furnaces by night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crowned by day with wreaths of smoke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then eastward, wafted in my flight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my enchanter's magic cloak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sail across the Tyrrhene Sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the land of Italy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er the windy Apennines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mantled and musical with pines.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palaces, the princely halls,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors of houses and the walls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of churches and of belfry towers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloister and castle, street and mart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are garlanded and gay with flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blossom in the fields of art.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Gubbio's workshops gleam and glow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With brilliant, iridescent dyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling whiteness of the snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cobalt blue of summer skies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vase and scutcheon, cup and plate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In perfect finish emulate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faenza, Florence, Pesaro.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth from Urbino's gate there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth with the angelic name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Raphael, in form and face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself angelic, and divine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In arts of color and design.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From him Francesco Xanto caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something of his transcendent grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And into fictile fabrics wrought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggestions of the master's thought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor less Maestro Giorgio shines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With madre-perl and golden lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of arabesques, and interweaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His birds and fruits and flowers and leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About some landscape, shaded brown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With olive tints on rock and town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold this cup within whose bowl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a ground of deepest blue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With yellow-lustred stars o'erlaid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colors of every tint and hue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingle in one harmonious whole!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With large blue eyes and steadfast gaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her yellow hair in net and braid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Necklace and ear-rings all ablaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With golden lustre o'er the glaze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman's portrait; on the scroll,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cana, the Beautiful!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgotten save for such brief fame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this memorial can bestow,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gift some lover long ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave with his heart to this fair dame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nobler title to renown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is thine, O pleasant Tuscan town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated beside the Arno's stream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucca della Robbia there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created forms so wondrous fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made thy sovereignty supreme.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These choristers with lips of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose music is not heard, but seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still chant, as from their organ-screen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their Maker's praise; nor these alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more fragile forms of clay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly less beautiful than they,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These saints and angels that adorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls of hospitals, and tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of good deeds so well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That poverty seems less forlorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life more like a holiday.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in this old neglected church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That long eludes the traveller's search,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies the dead bishop on his tomb;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth upon earth he slumbering lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life-like and death-like in the gloom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garlands of fruit and flowers in bloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And foliage deck his resting place;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow in the sightless eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pallor on the patient face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made perfect by the furnace heat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All earthly passions and desires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burnt out by purgatorial fires;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeming to say, "Our years are fleet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the weary death is sweet."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most wonderful of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ornaments on tomb or wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That grace the fair Ausonian shores
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are those the faithful earth restores,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near some Apulian town concealed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vineyard or in harvest field,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vases and urns and bas-reliefs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorials of forgotten griefs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or records of heroic deeds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of demigods and mighty chiefs:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures that almost move and speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, buried amid mould and weeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still in their attitudes attest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of the graceful Greek,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achilles in his armor dressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcides with the Cretan bull,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Aphrodite with her boy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lovely Helena of Troy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still living and still beautiful.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn, turn, my wheel!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is nature's plan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child should grow into the man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man grow wrinkled, old, and gray;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In youth the heart exults and sings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pulses leap, the feet have wings;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In age the cricket chirps, and brings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest home of day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the winds that southward blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cool the hot Sicilian isle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear me away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long line of the Libyan Nile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding and feeding the parched land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With annual ebb and overflow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fallen palm whose branches lie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the Abyssinian sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose roots are in Egyptian sands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On either bank huge water-wheels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belted with jars and dripping weeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send forth their melancholy moans,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if, in their gray mantles hid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead anchorites of the Thebaid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt on the shore and told their beads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beating their breasts with loud appeals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And penitential tears and groans.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city, walled and thickly set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With glittering mosque and minaret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Cairo, in whose gay bazaars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreaming traveller first inhales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfume of Arabian gales,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sees the fabulous earthen jars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge as were those wherein the maid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgiana found the Forty Thieves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concealed in midnight ambuscade;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing, more than half believes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating tales that run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the Thousand Nights and One,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told by the fair Scheherezade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More strange and wonderful than these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the Egyptian deities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ammonn, and Emeth, and the grand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osiris, holding in his hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lotus; Isis, crowned and veiled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred Ibis, and the Sphinx;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bracelets with blue enamelled links;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scarabee in emerald mailed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or spreading wide his funeral wings;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamps that perchance their night-watch kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er Cleopatra while she slept,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All plundered from the tombs of kings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn, turn, my wheel!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every tongue, of every place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caucasian, Coptic, or Malay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that inhabit this great earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever be their rank or worth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are kindred and allied by birth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made of the same clay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er desert sands, o'er gulf and bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er Ganges and o'er Himalay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird-like I fly, and flying sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To flowery kingdoms of Cathay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bird-like poise on balanced wing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the town of King-te-tching,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burning town, or seeming so,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand furnaces that glow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incessantly, and fill the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With smoke uprising, gyre on gyre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And painted by the lurid glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of jets and flashes of red fire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As leaves that in the autumn fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spotted and veined with various hues,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are swept along the avenues,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lie in heaps by hedge and wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from this grove of chimneys whirled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the markets of the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These porcelain leaves are wafted on,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light yellow leaves with spots and stains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of violet and of crimson dye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or tender azure of a sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just washed by gentle April rains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beautiful with celadon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor less the coarser household wares,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The willow pattern, that we knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In childhood, with its bridge of blue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading to unknown thoroughfares;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solitary man who stares
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the white river flowing through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its arches, the fantastic trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wild perspective of the view;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And intermingled among these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiles that in our nurseries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled us with wonder and delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or haunted us in dreams at night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yonder by Nankin, behold!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tower of Porcelain, strange and old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplifting to the astonished skies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its ninefold painted balconies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With balustrades of twining leaves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And roofs of tile, beneath whose eaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang porcelain bells that all the time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring with a soft, melodious chime;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the whole fabric is ablaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With varied tints, all fused in one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great mass of color, like a maze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowers illumined by the sun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn, turn, my wheel!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is begun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At daybreak must at dark be done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow will be another day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow the hot furnace flame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will search the heart and try the frame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stamp with honor or with shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These vessels made of clay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradled and rocked in Eastern seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The islands of the Japanese
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath me lie; o'er lake and plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stork, the heron, and the crane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the clear realms of azure drift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the hillside I can see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villages of Imari,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose thronged and flaming workshops lift
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their twisted columns of smoke on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud cloisters that in ruins lie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sunshine streaming through each rift,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And broken arches of blue sky.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the bright flowers that fill the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripple of waves on rock or sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow on Fusiyama's cone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midnight heaven so thickly sown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With constellations of bright stars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves that rustle, the reeds that make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whisper by each stream and lake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saffron dawn, the sunset red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are painted on these lovely jars;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the skylark sings, again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stork, the heron, and the crane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Float through the azure overhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counterfeit and counterpart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Nature reproduced in Art.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art is the child of Nature; yes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her darling child, in whom we trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The features of the mother's face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her aspect and her attitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her majestic loveliness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chastened and softened and subdued
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a more attractive grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a human sense imbued.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the greatest artist, then,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether of pencil or of pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who follows Nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As artist or as artisan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuing his own fantasies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can touch the human heart, or please,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or satisfy our nobler needs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he who sets his willing feet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nature's footprints, light and fleet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And follows fearless where she leads.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus mused I on that morn in May,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in my visions like the Seer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose eyes behold not what is near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only what is far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, suddenly sounding peal on peal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church-bell from the neighboring town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proclaimed the welcome hour of noon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Potter heard, and stopped his wheel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His apron on the grass threw down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistled his quiet little tune,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not overloud nor overlong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ended thus his simple song:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, stop, my wheel!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too soon, too soon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noon will be the afternoon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too soon to-day be yesterday;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind us in our path we cast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken potsherds of the past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all are ground to dust a last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trodden into clay!

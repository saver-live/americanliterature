<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have eaten your bread and salt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have drunk your water and wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deaths ye died I have watched be-side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lives that ye led were mine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there aught that I did not share
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vigil or toil or ease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One joy or woe that I did not know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear hearts across the seas?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have written the tale of our life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a sheltered peopleÂ’s mirth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In jesting guise, but ye are wise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ye know what the jest is worth.
</pre>

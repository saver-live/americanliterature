<p>A snake, it coils<br> Bewitching the heart.<br> Day after day, coos<br> A dove on the white sill.<br> <br> A bright flash in frost,<br> Drowsy night-scented stockâ€¦<br> Yet, sure and secret,<br> It's far from peace and joy.<br> <br> It knows how to weep sweetly<br> In the violin's yearning prayer;<br> And is fearfully divined<br> In a stranger's smile.<br></p>

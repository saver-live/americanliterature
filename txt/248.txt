<p>Like a white stone in a well's depths,<br> A single memory remains to me,<br> That I can't, won't fight against:<br> It's happiness â€“ and misery.<br> <br> Ithink someone who gazed full<br> In my eyes, would see it straight.<br> They'd be sad, be thoughtful,<br> As if hearing a mournful tale.<br> <br> I know the gods changed people<br> To things, yet left consciousness free.<br> To keep suffering's wonder alive,<br> In memory, you changed into me.<br></p>

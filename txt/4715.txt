<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Battle. The PRINCESS by the Standard on the Ravelin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter Gow, with the Crown of the Kingdom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. Heres earnest of the Queens submission.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This by her last herald, and in haste.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. Twas ours already. Where is the woman?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. Fled with her horse. They broke at dawn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noon has not struck, and youre Queen questionless.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. By you, through you. How shall I honour you?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. Me? But for what?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. For all, all, all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the realm sunk beneath us! Hear him! For what?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your body twixt my bosom and her knife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your lips on the cup she proffered for my death;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your one cloak over me, that night in the snows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We held the Pass at Bargi. Every hour
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New strengths, to this most unbelievable last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honour him? I will honour, will honour you, . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis at your choice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. Child, mine was long ago.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Enter FERDINAND, as from horse.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But heres one worthy honour. Welcome, Fox!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. And to you, Watchdog. This day clenches all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weve made it and seen it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. Is the city held?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. Loyally. Oh, theyre drunk with loyalty yonder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A virtuous mood. Your bombards helped em to it . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But heres my word for you. The Lady Frances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. I left her sick in the city. No harm, I pray.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. Nothing that she called harm. In truth, so little
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That (to Gow) I am bidden tell you, shell be here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as soon as I.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. She says it?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. Writes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This. (Gives him letter.) Yester eve. Twas given me by the priest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He with her in her hour.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. So? (Reads) So it is.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will be here. (To Ferdinand) And all is safe in the city?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. As thy long sword and my lean wits can make it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youve naught to stay for. Is it the road again?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. Ay. This time, not alone . . . She will be here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. I am here. You have not looked at me awhile.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. The rest is with you, Ferdinand . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then free.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. And at my service more than ever. I claim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Our wars have taught me), being your Queen, now, claim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wholly mine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. Then free . . . She will be here! A little while.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS (to FERDINAND). He looks beyond, not at me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. Weariness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not so young as once was. Two days fight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worthy servitor, to be allowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some freedom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. I have offered him all he would.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. He takes what he has taken.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Spirit of the LADY FRANCES appears to Gow.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. Frances

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. Distraught!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. An old head-blow, maybe. He has dealt in them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW (to the Spirit). What can the Grave against us, O my Heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comfort and light and reason in all things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visible and invisible, my one God?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou that wast I these barren unyoked years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of triflings now at end! Frances!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. Shes old.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. True. By most reckonings old.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must keep other count.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. He kisses his hand to the air!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. His ring, rather, he kisses. Yes, for sure, the ring.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOW. Dear and most dear. And now, those very arms. (Dies.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. Oh, look! He faints. Haste, you! Unhelm him! Help!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. Needless. No help
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avails against that poison. He is sped.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. By his own hand? This hour? When I had offered.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. He had made other choice, an old, old choice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neer swerved from, and now patently sealed in death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. He called on, the Lady Frances was it? Wherefore?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. Because she was his life. Forgive, my friend, (covers Gows face)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods uttermost beyond me in all faith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service and passion, if I unveil at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret. (To the Princess) Thought, dreamed you, it was for you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He poured himself, for you resoldered the Crown?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck here, held there, amended, broke, built up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His multiplied imaginings for you?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. I thought, I thought he.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERDINAND. Looked beyond. Her wish
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the sole Law he knew. She did not choose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your House should perish. Therefore he bade it stand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough for him when she had breathed a word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twas his to make it iron, stone, or fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving our flesh and blood before his ways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the wind straws. Her one face unregarded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting you with your mantle or your glove,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the God whom he is gone to worship.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Trumpets without. Enter the Princes Heralds.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heres the work of Kingship begun again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These from the Prince of Bargi, to whose sword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You owe such help as may, he thinks, be paid . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hes equal in blood, in fortune more than peer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young, most well favoured, with a heart to love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And two States in the balance. Do you meet him?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCESS. God and my Misery! I have seen Love at last.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall content me after?

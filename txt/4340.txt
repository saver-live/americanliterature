<pre>I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Agnes Eve Ah, bitter chill it was!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hare limpd trembling through the frozen grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silent was the flock in woolly fold:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numb were the Beadsmans fingers, while he told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His rosary, and while his frosted breath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like pious incense from a censer old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemd taking flight for heaven, without a death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the sweet Virgins picture, while his prayer he saith.

II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sculpturd dead, on each side, seem to freeze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emprisond in black, purgatorial rails:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knights, ladies, praying in dumb oratries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He passeth by; and his weak spirit fails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails.

III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northward he turneth through a little door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scarce three steps, ere Musics golden tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flatterd to tears this aged man and poor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no already had his deathbell rung;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joys of all his life were said and sung:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His was harsh penance on St. Agnes Eve:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way he went, and soon among
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough ashes sat he for his souls reprieve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all night kept awake, for sinners sake to grieve.

IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it chancd, for many a door was wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hurry to and fro. Soon, up aloft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver, snarling trumpets gan to chide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level chambers, ready with their pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were glowing to receive a thousand guests:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carved angels, ever eager-eyed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stard, where upon their heads the cornice rests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts.

V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length burst in the argent revelry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With plume, tiara, and all rich array,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous as shadows haunting fairily
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain, new stuff d, in youth, with triumphs gay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of old romance. These let us wish away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turn, sole-thoughted, to one Lady there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On love, and wingd St. Agnes saintly care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she had heard old dames full many times declare.

VI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told her how, upon St. Agnes Eve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young virgins might have visions of delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soft adorings from their loves receive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the honeyd middle of the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ceremonies due they did aright;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, supperless to bed they must retire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And couch supine their beauties, lily white;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.

VII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music, yearning like a God in pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixd on the floor, saw many a sweeping train
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass by she heeded not at all: in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And back retird; not coold by high disdain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighd for Agnes dreams, the sweetest of the year.

VIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dancd along with vague, regardless eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hallowd hour was near at hand: she sighs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the timbrels, and the throngd resort
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of whisperers in anger, or in sport;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoodwinkd with faery fancy; all amort,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save to St. Agnes and her lambs unshorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn.

IX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, purposing each moment to retire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lingerd still. Meantime, across the moors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had come young Porphyro, with heart on fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Madeline. Beside the portal doors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buttressd from moonlight, stands he, and implores
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All saints to give him sight of Madeline,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for one moment in the tedious hours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he might gaze and worship all unseen;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss in sooth such things have been.

X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ventures in: let no buzzd whisper tell:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will storm his heart, Loves fevrous citadel:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose very dogs would execrations howl
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against his lineage: not one breast affords
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him any mercy, in that mansion foul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul.

XI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, happy chance! the aged creature came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where he stood, hid from the torchs flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind a broad hall-pillar, far beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of merriment and chorus bland:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He startled her; but soon she knew his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And graspd his fingers in her palsied hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, Mercy, Porphyro! hie thee from this place;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race!

XII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get hence! get hence! theres dwarfish Hildebrand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a fever late, and in the fit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cursed thee and thine, both house and land:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then theres that old Lord Maurice, not a whit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More tame for his gray hairs, Alas me! flit!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flit like a ghost away. Ah, Gossip dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were safe enough; here in this arm-chair sit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell me how Good Saints! not here, not here;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier.

XIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followd through a lowly arched way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as she mutterd Well-a-well-a-day!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found him in a little moonlight room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale, latticd, chill, and silent as a tomb.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now tell me where is Madeline, said he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O tell me, Angela, by the holy loom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which none but secret sisterhood may see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they St. Agnes wool are weaving piously.

XIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Agnes! Ah! it is St. Agnes Eve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet men will murder upon holy days:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou must hold water in a witchs sieve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be liege-lord of all the Elves and Fays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To venture so: it fills me with amaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see thee, Porphyro! St. Agnes Eve!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods help! my lady fair the conjuror plays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This very night: good angels her deceive!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me laugh awhile, Ive mickle time to grieve.

XV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Porphyro upon her face doth look,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like puzzled urchin on an aged crone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who keepeth closd a wondrous riddle-book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As spectacled she sits in chimney nook.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ladys purpose; and he scarce could brook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Madeline asleep in lap of legends old.

XVI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flushing his brow, and in his pained heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made purple riot: then doth he propose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stratagem, that makes the beldame start:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cruel man and impious thou art:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone with her good angels, far apart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From wicked men like thee. Go, go! I deem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.

XVII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth Porphyro: O may I neer find grace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one of her soft ringlets I displace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or look with ruffian passion in her face:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good Angela, believe me by these tears;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I will, even in a moments space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake, with horrid shout, my foemens ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beard them, though they be more fangd than wolves and bears.

XVIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were never missd. Thus plaining, doth she bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentler speech from burning Porphyro;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So woful, and of such deep sorrowing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Angela gives promise she will do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe.

XIX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was, to lead him, in close secrecy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to Madelines chamber, and there hide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him in a closet, of such privacy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he might see her beauty unespied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And win perhaps that night a peerless bride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While legiond fairies pacd the coverlet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pale enchantment held her sleepy-eyed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never on such a night have lovers met,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Merlin paid his Demon all the monstrous debt.

XX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be as thou wishest, said the Dame:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All cates and dainties shall be stored there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am slow and feeble, and scarce dare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such a catering trust my dizzy head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while: Ah! thou must needs the lady wed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or may I never leave my grave among the dead.

XXI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, she hobbled off with busy fear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovers endless minutes slowly passd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dame returnd, and whisperd in his ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To follow her; with aged eyes aghast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From fright of dim espial. Safe at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through many a dusky gallery, they gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maidens chamber, silken, hushd, and chaste;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Porphyro took covert, pleasd amain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain.

XXII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her faltring hand upon the balustrade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Angela was feeling for the stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Madeline, St. Agnes charmed maid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, like a missiond spirit, unaware:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With silver tapers light, and pious care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turnd, and down the aged gossip led
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a safe level matting. Now prepare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Porphyro, for gazing on that bed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove frayd and fled.

XXIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out went the taper as she hurried in;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closd the door, she panted, all akin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spirits of the air, and visions wide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No uttered syllable, or, woe betide!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to her heart, her heart was voluble,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paining with eloquence her balmy side;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though a tongueless nightingale should swell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell.

XXIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A casement high and triple-archd there was,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All garlanded with carven imagries
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And diamonded with panes of quaint device,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As are the tiger-moths deep-damaskd wings;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the midst, mong thousand heraldries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twilight saints, and dim emblazonings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shielded scutcheon blushd with blood of queens and kings.

XXV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threw warm gules on Madelines fair breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As down she knelt for heavens grace and boon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her silver cross soft amethyst,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on her hair a glory, like a saint:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seemd a splendid angel, newly drest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save wings, for heaven: Porphyro grew faint:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.

XXVI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon his heart revives: her vespers done,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unclasps her warmed jewels one by one;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fancy, fair St. Agnes in her bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.

XXVII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sort of wakeful swoon, perplexd she lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppressd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blissfully havend both from joy and pain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claspd like a missal where swart Paynims pray;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again.

XXVIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoln to this paradise, and so entranced,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Porphyro gazed upon her empty dress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listend to her breathing, if it chanced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wake into a slumberous tenderness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which when he heard, that minute did he bless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathd himself: then from the closet crept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the hushd carpet, silent, stept,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tween the curtains peepd, where, lo! how fast she slept.

XXIX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then by the bed-side, where the faded moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A table, and, half anguishd, threw thereon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O for some drowsy Morphean amulet!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kettle-drum, and far-heard clarionet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affray his ears, though but in dying tone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.

XXX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In blanched linen, smooth, and lavenderd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he from forth the closet brought a heap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With jellies soother than the creamy curd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manna and dates, in argosy transferrd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From silken Samarcand to cedard Lebanon.

XXXI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These delicates he heapd with glowing hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On golden dishes and in baskets bright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wreathed silver: sumptuous they stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the retired quiet of the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the chilly room with perfume light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art my heaven, and I thine eremite:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open thine eyes, for meek St. Agnes sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.

XXXII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank in her pillow. Shaded was her dream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the dusk curtains: twas a midnight charm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impossible to melt as iced stream:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemd he never, never could redeem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From such a stedfast spell his ladys eyes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So musd awhile, entoild in woofed phantasies.

XXXIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakening up, he took her hollow lute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tumultuous, and, in chords that tenderest be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He playd an ancient ditty, long since mute,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Provence calld, La belle dame sans mercy:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to her ear touching the melody;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith disturbd, she utterd a soft moan:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceased, she panted quick and suddenly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone.

XXXIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes were open, but she still beheld,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a painful change, that nigh expelld
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blisses of her dream so pure and deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At which fair Madeline began to weep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And moan forth witless words with many a sigh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While still her gaze on Porphyro would keep;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing to move or speak, she lookd so dreamingly.

XXXV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Porphyro! said she, but even now
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made tuneable with every sweetest vow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those sad eyes were spiritual and clear:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How changd thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me that voice again, my Porphyro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those looks immortal, those complainings dear!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh leave me not in this eternal woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if thou diest, my Love, I know not where to go.

XXXVI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond a mortal man impassiond far
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At these voluptuous accents, he arose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethereal, flushd, and like a throbbing star
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen mid the sapphire heavens deep repose;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into her dream he melted, as the rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blendeth its odour with the violet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Loves alarum pattering the sharp sleet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the window-panes; St. Agnes moon hath set.

XXXVII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no dream, my bride, my Madeline!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tis dark: the iced gusts still rave and beat:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I curse not, for my heart is lost in thine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though thou forsakest a deceived thing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing.

XXXVIII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy beautys shield, heart-shapd and vermeil dyed?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, silver shrine, here will I take my rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After so many hours of toil and quest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A famishd pilgrim, saved by miracle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving of thy sweet self; if thou thinkst well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To trust, fair Madeline, to no rude infidel.

XXXIX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark! Tis an elfin-storm from faery land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, arise! the morning is at hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloated wassaillers will never heed:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us away, my love, with happy speed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drownd all in Rhenish and the sleepy mead:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake! arise! my love, and fearless be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For oer the southern moors I have a home for thee.

XL

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hurried at his words, beset with fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there were sleeping dragons all around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the house was heard no human sound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chain-droopd lamp was flickering by each door;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flutterd in the besieging winds uproar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.

XLI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lay the Porter, in uneasy sprawl,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a huge empty flaggon by his side;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his sagacious eye an inmate owns:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groan.

XLII

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are gone: ay, ages long ago
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lovers fled away into the storm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night the Baron dreamt of many a woe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his warrior-guests, with shade and form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were long be-nightmard. Angela the old
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Died palsy-twitchd, with meagre face deform;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beadsman, after thousand aves told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold.

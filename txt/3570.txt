<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You smile upon your friend to-day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day his ills are over;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hearken to the lover's say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And happy is the lover.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis late to hearken, late to smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But better late than never:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall have lived a little while
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I die for ever.
</pre>

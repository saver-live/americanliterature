<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE BELL OF ATRI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Atri in Abruzzo, a small town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ancient Roman date, but scant renown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of those little places that have run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half up the hill, beneath a blazing sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then sat down to rest, as if to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I climb no farther upward, come what may,"--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Re Giovanni, now unknown to fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many monarchs since have borne the name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a great bell hung in the market-place
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a roof, projecting some small space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of shelter from the sun and rain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rode he through the streets with all his train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with the blast of trumpets loud and long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made proclamation, that whenever wrong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was done to any man, he should but ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great bell in the square, and he, the King,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would cause the Syndic to decide thereon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the proclamation of King John.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How swift the happy days in Atri sped,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wrongs were righted, need not here be said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it that, as all things must decay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hempen rope at length was worn away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unravelled at the end, and, strand by strand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loosened and wasted in the ringer's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till one, who noted this in passing by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mended the rope with braids of briony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the leaves and tendrils of the vine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung like a votive garland at a shrine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By chance it happened that in Atri dwelt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight, with spur on heel and sword in belt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved to hunt the wild-boar in the woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved his falcons with their crimson hoods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved his hounds and horses, and all sports
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prodigalities of camps and courts;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved, or had loved them; for at last, grown old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only passion was the love of gold.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sold his horses, sold his hawks and hounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rented his vineyards and his garden-grounds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept but one steed, his favorite steed of all,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To starve and shiver in a naked stall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And day by day sat brooding in his chair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devising plans how best to hoard and spare.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length he said: "What is the use or need
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep at my own cost this lazy steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eating his head off in my stables here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When rents are low and provender is dear?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him go feed upon the public ways;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want him only for the holidays."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the old steed was turned into the heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the long, lonely, silent, shadeless street;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wandered in suburban lanes forlorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barked at by dogs, and torn by brier and thorn.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One afternoon, as in that sultry clime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the custom in the summer time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bolted doors and window-shutters closed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inhabitants of Atri slept or dozed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When suddenly upon their senses fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud alarum of the accusing bell!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Syndic started from his deep repose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned on his couch, and listened, and then rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And donned his robes, and with reluctant pace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went panting forth into the market-place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the great bell upon its cross-beam swung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reiterating with persistent tongue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half-articulate jargon, the old song:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some one hath done a wrong, hath done a wrong!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ere he reached the belfry's light arcade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw, or thought he saw, beneath its shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No shape of human form of woman born,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a poor steed dejected and forlorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who with uplifted head and eager eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was tugging at the vines of briony.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Domeneddio!" cried the Syndie straight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the Knight of Atri's steed of state!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calls for justice, being sore distressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pleads his cause as loudly as the best."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile from street and lane a noisy crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had rolled together like a summer cloud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told the story of the wretched beast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In five-and-twenty different ways at least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With much gesticulation and appeal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To heathen gods, in their excessive zeal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight was called and questioned; in reply
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not confess the fact, did not deny;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treated the matter as a pleasant jest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set at naught the Syndic and the rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining, in an angry undertone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he should do what pleased him with his own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereupon the Syndic gravely read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proclamation of the King; then said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pride goeth forth on horseback grand and gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cometh back on foot, and begs its way;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fame is the fragrance of heroic deeds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flowers of chivalry and not of weeds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are familiar proverbs; but I fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never yet have reached your knightly ear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What fair renown, what honor, what repute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can come to you from starving this poor brute?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who serves well and speaks not, merits more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than they who clamor loudest at the door.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the law decrees that as this steed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Served you in youth, henceforth you shall take heed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To comfort his old age, and to provide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelter in stall an food and field beside."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight withdrew abashed; the people all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led home the steed in triumph to his stall.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King heard and approved, and laughed in glee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cried aloud: "Right well it pleaseth me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Church-bells at best but ring us to the door;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But go not in to mass; my bell doth more:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cometh into court and pleads the cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of creatures dumb and unknown to the laws;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this shall make, in every Christian clime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bell of Atri famous for all time."



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, well your story pleads the cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those dumb mouths that have no speech,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a cry from each to each
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its own kind, with its own laws;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that is beyond the reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human power to learn or teach,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inarticulate moan of pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the immeasurable main
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking upon an unknown beach."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus spake the Poet with a sigh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then added, with impassioned cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who feels the words he speaks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color flushing in his cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fervor burning in his eye:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Among the noblest in the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he may count himself the least,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That man I honor and revere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who without favor, without fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great city dares to stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friend of every friendless beast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tames with his unflinching hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brutes that wear our form and face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The were-wolves of the human race!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then paused, and waited with a frown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some old champion of romance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, having thrown his gauntlet down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expectant leans upon his lance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But neither Knight nor Squire is found
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise the gauntlet from the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And try with him the battle's chance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake from your dreams, O Edrehi!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or dreaming speak to us, and make
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feint of being half awake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell us what your dreams may be.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the hazy atmosphere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cloud-land deign to reappear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among us in this Wayside Inn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us what visions and what scenes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illuminate the dark ravines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which you grope your way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Sicilian spake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made no reply, but only smiled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men unto a wayward child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not knowing what to answer, do.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a cavern's mouth, o'ergrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With moss and intertangled vines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A streamlet leaps into the light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmurs over root and stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a melodious undertone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as amid the noonday night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sombre and wind-haunted pines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There runs a sound as of the sea;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from his bearded lips there came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A melody without a name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A song, a tale, a history,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or whatsoever it may be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ and recorded in these lines.

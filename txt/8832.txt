<p>THOU couldst not look on me and live: so runs<br> The mortal legend -- thou that couldst not live<br> Nor look on me (so the divine decree)!<br> That sawst me in the cloud, the wave, the bough,<br> The clod commoved with April, and the shapes<br> Lurking 'twixt lid and eye-ball in the dark.<br> Mocked I thee not in every guise of life,<br> Hid in girls' eyes, a naiad in her well,<br> Wooed through their laughter, and like echo fled,<br> Luring thee down the primal silences<br> Where the heart hushes and the flesh is dumb?<br> Nay, was not I the tide that drew thee out<br> Relentlessly from the detaining shore,<br> Forth from the home-lights and the hailing voices,<br> Forth from the last faint headland's failing line,<br> Till I enveloped thee from verge to verge<br> And hid thee in the hollow of my being?<br> And still, because between us hung the veil,<br> The myriad-tinted veil of sense, thy feet<br> Refused their rest, thy hands the gifts of life,<br> Thy heart its losses, lest some lesser face<br> Should blur mine image in thine upturned soul<br> Ere death had stamped it there. This was thy thought.<br> And mine?<br> The gods, they say, have all: not so!<br> This have they -- flocks on every hill, the blue<br> Spirals of incense and the amber drip<br> Of lucid honey-comb on sylvan shrines,<br> First-chosen weanlings, doves immaculate,<br> Twin-cooing in the osier-plaited cage,<br> And ivy-garlands glaucous with the dew:<br> Man's wealth, man's servitude, but not himself!<br> And so they pale, for lack of warmth they wane,<br> Freeze to the marble of their images,<br> And, pinnacled on man's subserviency,<br> Through the thick sacrificial haze discern<br> Unheeding lives and loves, as some cold peak<br> Through icy mists may enviously descry<br> Warm vales unzoned to the all-fruitful sun.<br> So they along an immortality<br> Of endless-vistaed homage strain their gaze,<br> If haply some rash votary, empty-urned,<br> But light of foot, with all-adventuring hand,<br> Break rank, fling past the people and the priest,<br> Up the last step, on to the inmost shrine,<br> And there, the sacred curtain in his clutch,<br> Drop dead of seeing -- while the others prayed!<br> Yea, this we wait for, this renews us, this<br> Incarnates us, pale people of your dreams,<br> Who are but what you make us, wood or stone,<br> Or cold chryselephantine hung with gems,<br> Or else the beating purpose of your life,<br> Your sword, your clay, the note your pipe pursues,<br> The face that haunts your pillow, or the light<br> Scarce visible over leagues of laboring sea!<br> O thus through use to reign again, to drink<br> The cup of peradventure to the lees,<br> For one dear instant disimmortalized<br> In giving immortality!<br> So dream the gods upon their listless thrones.<br> Yet sometimes, when the votary appears,<br> With death-affronting forehead and glad eyes,<br> Too young, they rather muse, too frail thou art,<br> And shall we rob some girl of saffron veil<br> And nuptial garland for so slight a thing?<br> And so to their incurious loves return.<br> <br> Not so with thee; for some indeed there are<br> Who would behold the truth and then return<br> To pine among the semblances -- but I<br> Divined in thee the questing foot that never<br> Revisits the cold hearth of yesterday<br> Or calls achievement home. I from afar<br> Beheld thee fashioned for one hour's high use,<br> Nor meant to slake oblivion drop by drop.<br> Long, long hadst thou inhabited my dreams,<br> Surprising me as harts surprise a pool,<br> Stealing to drink at midnight; I divined<br> Thee rash to reach the heart of life, and lie<br> Bosom to bosom in occasion's arms,<br> And said: Because I love thee thou shalt die!<br> <br> For immortality is not to range<br> Unlimited through vast Olympian days,<br> Or sit in dull dominion over time;<br> But this -- to drink fate's utmost at a draught,<br> Nor feel the wine grow stale upon the lip,<br> To scale the summit of some soaring moment,<br> Nor know the dulness of the long descent,<br> To snatch the crown of life and seal it up<br> Secure forever in the vaults of death!<br> <br> And this was thine: to lose thyself in me,<br> Relive in my renewal, and become<br> The light of other lives, a quenchless torch<br> Passed on from hand to hand, till men are dust<br> And the last garland withers from my shrine.</p>

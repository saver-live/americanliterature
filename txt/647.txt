<p>By the North Gate, the wind blows full of sand,<br> Lonely from the beginning of time until now!<br> Trees rail, the grass goes yellow with autumn.<br> I climb the towers and towers<br> to watch out the barbarous land:<br> Desolate castle, the sky, the wide desert.<br> There is no wall left to this village.<br> Bones white with a thousand frosts,<br> High heaps, covered with trees and grass;<br> Who brought this to pass?<br> Who has brought the flaming imperial anger?<br> Who has brought the army with drums and with kettle-drums?<br> Barbarous kings.<br> A gracious spring, turned to blood-ravenous autumn,<br> A turmoil of wars-men, spread over the middle kingdom,<br> Three hundred and sixty thousand,<br> And sorrow, sorrow like rain.<br> Sorrow to go, and sorrow, sorrow returning.<br> Desolate, desolate fields,<br> And no children of warfare upon them,<br> No longer the men for offence and defence.<br> Ah, how shall you know the dreary sorrow at the North Gate, <br> With Rihaku's name forgotten, <br> And we guardsmen fed to the tigers. <br></p>

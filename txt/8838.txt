<p>BEFORE the clepsydra had bound the days<br> Man tethered Change to his fixed star, and said:<br> "The elder races, that long since are dead,<br> Marched by that light; it swerves not from its base<br> Though all the worlds about it wax and fade."<br> <br> When Egypt saw it, fast in reeling spheres,<br> Her Pyramids shaft-centred on its ray<br> She reared and said: "Long as this star holds sway<br> In uninvaded ether, shall the years<br> Revere my monuments--" and went her way.<br> <br> The Pyramids abide; but through the shaft<br> That held the polar pivot, eye to eye,<br> Look now--blank nothingness! As though Change laughed<br> At man's presumption and his puny craft,<br> The star has slipped its leash and roams the sky.<br> <br> Yet could the immemorial piles be swung<br> A skyey hair's-breadth from their rooted base,<br> Back to the central anchorage of space,<br> Ah, then again, as when the race was young,<br> Should they behold the beacon of the race!<br> <br> Of old, men said: "The Truth is there: we rear<br> Our faith full-centred on it. It was known<br> Thus of the elders who foreran us here,<br> Mapped out its circuit in the shifting sphere,<br> And found it, 'mid mutation, fixed alone."<br> <br> Change laughs again, again the sky is cold,<br> And down that fissure now no star-beam glides.<br> Yet they whose sweep of vision grows not old<br> Still at the central point of space behold<br> Another pole-star: for the Truth abides.</p>

<p><cite class="al-title">The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice</cite> (1622) is Shakespeare's tragedy about the downfall of Othello. Lago, a deceitful, devious ensign in the Venitian Army, is bitter about being passed over for promotion to lieutenant in favor of Cassio, so he sets out to get even. He fools Roderigo into thinking he served Othello, the general of Moor's Army, but his subsequent actions only serve himself and lead to the king's demise. Othello is convinced to murder his wife, and it's all downhill from there.</p><p><img alt="Charles West Cope, Shakespeare's Othello, Act 1, Scene III, 1868" title="Charles West Cope, Shakespeare's Othello, Act 1, Scene 3, 1868" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/play/othello.jpg" style="max-width:400px; float:left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="2665686931" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p><p><a href="dramatis-personae">Dramatis Personae</a></p><p><a href="act-1-scene-i-venice-a-street">ACT 1.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valour and Innocence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have latterly gone hence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To certain death by certain shame attended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envy, ah! even to tears!,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortune of their years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, though so few, yet so divinely ended.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce had they lifted up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifes full and fiery cup,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than they had set it down untouched before them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before their day arose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They beckoned it to close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close in destruction and confusion oer them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not stay to ask
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What prize should crown their task,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well sure that prize was such as no man strives for;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But passed into eclipse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her kiss upon their lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Belphoebes, whom they gave their lives for!

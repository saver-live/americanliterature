<p><b>The Tale of Two Bad Mice</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>It belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals.</p><p>Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings.</p><p>There were two red lobsters and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges.</p><p>They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.</p><p>One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator. There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet. Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.</p><p>Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again. Tom Thumb was a mouse.</p><p>A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.</p><p>The doll's-house stood at the other side of the fire-place. Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug. They pushed the front door--it was not fast.</p><p>Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room. Then they squeaked with joy!</p><p>Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs--all SO convenient!</p><p>Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham. It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red.</p><p>The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.</p><p>"It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca."</p><p>Hunca Munca stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.</p><p><img alt="Two Bad Mice baby" title="Two Bad Mice baby" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/two-bad-mice.jpg" style="max-width:400px; float:left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1571238558" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> "It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's," said Hunca Munca.</p><p>The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.</p><p>"Let it alone," said Tom Thumb; "give me some fish, Hunca Munca!"</p><p>Hunca Munca tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.</p><p>Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash, smash!</p><p>The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!</p><p>Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca. They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges.</p><p>As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.</p><p>Tom Thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top-- there was no soot.</p><p>While Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment. She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labelled-- Rice--Coffee--Sago--but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.</p><p>Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could--especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window.</p><p><img alt="Two Bad Mice baby" title="Two Bad Mice baby" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/two-bad-mice-baby.jpg" style="max-width:400px; float:left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="257769375" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed.</p><p>With Tom Thumbs's assistance she carried the bolster downstairs, and across the hearth-rug. It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse- hole; but they managed it somehow.</p><p>Then Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a book-case, a bird- cage, and several small odds and ends. The book-case and the bird- cage refused to go into the mousehole.</p><p>Hunca Munca left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.</p><p>Hunca Munca was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.</p><p>What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda! Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled--but neither of them made any remark.</p><p>The book-case and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal- box--but Hunca Munca has got the cradle, and some of Lucinda's clothes.</p><p>She also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.</p><p>The little girl that the doll's-house belonged to, said,--"I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!"</p><p>But the nurse said,--"I will set a mouse-trap!"</p><p>So that is the story of the two Bad Mice,--but they were not so very very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke.</p><p>He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane.</p><p>And very early every morning-- before anybody is awake--Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!</p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

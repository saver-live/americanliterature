<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Eochaid came at sundown to a wood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward of Tara. Hurrying to his queen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had out-ridden his war-wasted men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with empounded cattle trod the mire;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where beech trees had mixed a pale the green light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ground-ivys blue, he saw a stag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whiter than curds, its eyes the tint of the sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it stood upon his path and seemed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More hands in height than any stag in the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his trembling horse, then drove the spur;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the stag stooped and ran at him, and passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rending the horses flank. King Eochaid reeled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then drew his sword to hold its levelled point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the stag. When horn and steel were met
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn resounded as though it had been silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweet, miraculous, terrifying sound.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn locked in sword, they tugged and struggled there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though a stag and unicorn were met
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Africa on Mountain of the Moon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last the double horns, drawn backward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butted below the single and so pierced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrails of the horse. Dropping his sword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stared into the sea-green eye, and so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither and thither to and fro they trod
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all the place was beaten into mire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong thigh and the agile thigh were met,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands that gathered up the might of the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the elaborate wilderness of the air.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through bush they plunged and over ivied root,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where the stone struck fire, while in the leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when at last he forced those sinewy flanks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against a beech bole, he threw down the beast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knelt above it with drawn knife. On the instant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It vanished like a shadow, and a cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So mournful that it seemed the cry of one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had lost some unimaginable treasure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered between the blue and green leaf
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And climbed into the air, crumbling away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all had seemed a shadow or a vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the trodden mire, the pool of blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disembowelled horse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Eochaid ran,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward peopled Tara, nor stood to draw his breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he came before the painted wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The posts of polished yew, circled with bronze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the great door; but though the hanging lamps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor door, nor mouth, nor slipper made a noise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor on the ancient beaten paths, that wound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From well-side or from plough-land, was there noise;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there had been no sound of living thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before him or behind, but that far-off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the horizon edge bellowed the herds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that silence brings no good to kings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mocks returning victory, he passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the pillars with a beating heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw where in the midst of the great hall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale-faced, alone upon a bench, Edain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat upright with a sword before her feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hands on either side had gripped the bench,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes were cold and steady, her lips tight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some passion had made her stone. Hearing a foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She started and then knew whose foot it was;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he thought to take her in his arms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She motioned him afar, and rose and spoke:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sent among the fields or to the woods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting men and servants of this house,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I would have your judgment upon one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is self-accused. If she be innocent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would not look in any known mans face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till judgment has been given, and if guilty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will never look again on known mans face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at these words he paled, as she had paled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that he should find upon her lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of that monstrous day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You brought me where your brother Ardan sat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always in his one seat, and bid me care him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through that strange illness that had fixed him there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And should he die to heap his burial mound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carve his name in Ogham. Eochaid said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives? He lives and is a healthy man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have him and you it matters little
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What man you have lost, what evil you have found.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bid them make his bed under this roof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carried him his food with my own hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the weeks passed by. But when I said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this trouble? he would answer nothing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though always at my words his trouble grew;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I but asked the more, till he cried out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary of many questions: There are things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That make the heart akin to the dumb stone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I replied: Although you hide a secret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopeless and dear, or terrible to think on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak it, that I may send through the wide world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For medicine. Thereon he cried aloud:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day you question me, and I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is such a storm amid my thoughts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be carried in the gust, command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forbid, beseech and waste my breath. Then I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the thing that you have hid were evil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaking of it could be no great wrong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And evil must it be, if done twere worse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than mound and stone that keep all virtue in,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loosen on us dreams that waste our life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows and shows that can but turn the brain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But finding him still silent I stooped down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispering that none but he should hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said: If a woman has put this on you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My men, whether it please her or displease,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though they have to cross the Loughlan waters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take her in the middle of armed men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall make her look upon her handiwork,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she may quench the rick she has fired; and though
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She may have worn silk clothes, or worn a crown,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shell not be proud, knowing within her heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That our sufficient portion of the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that we give, although it be brief giving,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness to children and to men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he, driven by his thought beyond his thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speaking what he would not though he would,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed: You, even you yourself, could work the cure!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at those words I rose and I went out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for nine days he had food from other hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for nine days my mind went whirling round
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one disastrous zodiac, muttering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the immedicable mounds beyond
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our questioning, beyond our pity even.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when nine days had gone I stood again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his chair and bending down my head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told him, that when Orion rose, and all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women of his household were asleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go, for hope would give his limbs the power,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To an old empty woodmans house thats hidden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to a clump of beech trees in the wood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward of Tara, there to await a friend
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That could, as he had told her, work his cure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would be no harsh friend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When night had deepened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I groped my way through boughs, and over roots,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till oak and hazel ceased and beech began,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And found the house, a sputtering torch within,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ardan, and though I called to him and tried
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shake him out of sleep, I could not rouse him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waited till the night was on the turn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fearing that some labourer, on his way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To plough or pasture-land, might see me there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the ivy-covered rocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on the blue light of a sword, a man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had unnatural majesty, and eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood on my path. Trembling from head to foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gazed at him like grouse upon a kite;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with a voice that had unnatural music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A weary wooing and a long, he said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of love through other lips and looking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eyelids of another, for it was my craft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That put a passion in the sleeper there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I had got my will and drawn you here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I may speak to you alone, my craft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucked up the passion out of him again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left mere sleep. Hell wake when the sun wakes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wonder what has ailed him these twelve months.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cowered back upon the wall in terror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that sweet-sounding voice ran on: Woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was your husband when you rode the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced in the whirling foam and in the dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In days you have not kept in memory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being betrayed into a cradle, and I come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may claim you as my wife again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was no longer terrified, his voice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had half awakened some old memory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet answered him: I am King Eochaids wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with him have found every happiness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women can find. With a most masterful voice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made the body seem as it were a string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a bow, he cried: What happiness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can lovers have that know their happiness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must end at the dumb stone? But where we build
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sudden palaces in the still air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasure itself can bring no weariness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor can time waste the cheek, nor is there foot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has grown weary of the whirling dance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor an unlaughing mouth, but mine that mourns,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those mouths that sing their sweathearts praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your empty bed. How should I love, I answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shown my husband sleeping there, I have sighed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your strength and nobleness will pass away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or how should love be worth its pains were it not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That when he has fallen asleep within my arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being wearied out, I love in man the child?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can they know of love that do not know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She builds her nest upon a narrow ledge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above a windy precipice? Then he:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that when you come to the death-bed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must return, whether you would or no,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This human life blotted from memory,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must I live some thirty, forty years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone with all this useless happiness?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon he seized me in his arms, but I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust him away with both my hands and cried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never will I believe there is any change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can blot out of my memory this life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetened by death, but if I could believe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That were a double hunger in my lips
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what is doubly brief.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the shape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hands were pressed to, vanished suddenly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I staggered, but a beech tree stayed my fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clinging to it I could hear the cocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crow upon Tara.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Eochaid bowed his head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thanked her for her kindness to his brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that she promised, and for that refused.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose round the walls, and through the bronze-ringed door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jostled and shouted those war-wasted men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the midst King Eochaids brother stood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hed heard that din on the horizons edge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ridden towards it, being ignorant.

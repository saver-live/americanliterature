<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory and loveliness have pass'd away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if we wander out in early morn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wreathed incense do we see upborne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the east, to meet the smiling day:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No crowd of nymphs soft voic'd and young, and gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In woven baskets bringing ears of corn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roses, and pinks, and violets, to adorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shrine of Flora in her early May.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are left delights as high as these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall ever bless my destiny,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in a time, when under pleasant trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan is no longer sought, I feel a free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leafy luxury, seeing I could please
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these poor offerings, a man like thee.

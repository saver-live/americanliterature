<p>It was after we had had the measles, that fell and blighting disorder which we got from Alice picking up five deeply infected shillings that a bemeasled family had wrapped in a bit of paper to pay the doctor with and then carelessly dropped in the street. Alice held the packet hotly in her muff all through a charity concert. Hence these tears, as it says in Virgil. And if you have ever had measles you will know that this is not what is called figuring speech, because your eyes do run like mad all the time. </p><p> When we were unmeasled again we were sent to stay at Lymchurch with a Miss Sandal, and her motto was plain living and high thinking. She had a brother, and his motto was the same, and it was his charity concert that Alice held the fatal shillings in her muff throughout of. Later on he was giving tracts to a bricklayer, and fell off a scaffold in his giddy earnestness, and Miss Sandal had to go and nurse him. So the six of us stayed in the plain living, high thinking house by ourselves, and old Mrs. Beale from the village came in every day and did the housework. She was of humble birth, but was a true lady in minding her own affairs, which is what a great many ladies do not know how to do at all. We had no lessons to do, and we were thus free to attend to any adventures which came along. Adventures are the real business of life. The rest is only in-betweenness—what Albert's uncle calls padding. He is an author. </p><p> Miss Sandal's house was very plain and clean, with lots of white paint, and very difficult to play in. So we were out a good deal. It was seaside, so, of course, there was the beach, and besides that the marsh—big green fields with sheep all about, and wet dykes with sedge growing, and mud, and eels in the mud, and winding white roads that all look the same, and all very interesting, as though they might lead to almost anything that you didn't expect. Really, of course, they lead to Ashford and Romney and Ivychurch, and real live places like that. But they don't look it. </p><p> The day when what I am going to tell you about happened, we were all leaning on the stone wall looking at the pigs. The pigman is a great friend of ours—all except H. O., who is my youngest brother. His name is Horace Octavius, and if you want to know why we called him H. O. you had better read 'The Treasure Seekers' and find out. He had gone to tea with the schoolmaster's son—a hateful kid. </p><p> 'Isn't that the boy you're always fighting?' Dora asked when H. O. said he was going. </p><p> 'Yes,' said H. O., 'but, then, he keeps rabbits.' </p><p> So then we understood and let him go. </p><p> Well, the rest of us were gazing fondly on the pigs, and two soldiers came by. </p><p> We asked them where they were off to. </p><p> They told us to mind our own business, which is not manners, even if you are a soldier on private affairs. </p><p> 'Oh, all right,' said Oswald, who is the eldest. And he advised the soldiers to keep their hair on. The little they had was cut very short. </p><p> 'I expect they're scouts or something,' said Dicky; 'it's a field-day, or a sham-fight, or something, as likely as not.' </p><p> 'Let's go after them and see,' said Oswald, ever prompt in his decidings. So we did. </p><p> We ran a bit at first, so as not to let the soldiers have too much of a lead. Their red coats made it quite easy to keep them in sight on the winding white marsh road. But we did not catch them up: they seemed to go faster and faster. So we ran a little bit more every now and then, and we went quite a long way after them. But they didn't meet any of their officers or regiments or things, and we began to think that perchance we were engaged in the disheartening chase of the wild goose. This has sometimes occurred. </p><p> There is a ruined church about two miles from Lymchurch, and when we got close to that we lost sight of the red coats, so we stopped on the little bridge that is near there to reconnoitre. </p><p> The soldiers had vanished. </p><p> 'Well, here's a go!' said Dicky. </p><p> 'It is a wild-goose chase,' said Noël. 'I shall make a piece of poetry about it. I shall call the title the "Vanishing Reds, or, the Soldiers that were not when you got there."' </p><p> 'You shut up!' said Oswald, whose eagle eye had caught a glimpse of scarlet through the arch of the ruin. </p><p> None of the others had seen this. Perhaps you will think I do not say enough about Oswald's quickness of sight, so I had better tell you that is only because Oswald is me, and very modest. At least, he tries to be, because he knows it is what a true gentleman ought to. </p><p> 'They're in the ruins,' he went on. 'I expect they're going to have an easy and a pipe—out of the wind.' </p><p> 'I think it's very mysterious,' said Noël. 'I shouldn't wonder if they're going to dig for buried treasure. Let's go and see.' </p><p> 'No,' said Oswald, who, though modest, is thoughtful. 'If we do they'll stop digging, or whatever they're doing. When they've gone away, we'll go and see if the ground is scratched about.' </p><p> So we delayed where we were, but we saw no more scarlet. </p><p> In a little while a dull-looking man in brown came by on a bicycle. He stopped and got off. </p><p> 'Seen a couple of Tommies about here, my lad?' he said to Oswald. </p><p> Oswald does not like being called anybody's lad, especially that kind of man's; but he did not want to spoil the review, or field-day, or sham-fight, or whatever it might be, so he said: </p><p> 'Yes; they're up in the ruins.' </p><p> 'You don't say so!' said the man. 'In uniform, I suppose? Yes, of course, or you wouldn't have known they were soldiers. Silly cuckoos!' </p><p> He wheeled his bicycle up the rough lane that leads to the old ruin. </p><p> 'It can't be buried treasure,' said Dicky. </p><p> 'I don't care if it is,' said Oswald. 'We'll see what's happening. I don't mind spoiling his sport. "My ladding" me like that!' </p><p> So we followed the man with the bicycle. It was leaning against the churchyard gate when we got there. The man off it was going up to the ruin, and we went after him. </p><p> He did not call out to the soldiers, and we thought that odd; but it didn't make us think where it might have made us if we had had any sense. He just went creeping about, looking behind walls and inside arches, as though he was playing at hide-and-seek. There is a mound in the middle of the ruin, where stones and things have fallen during dark ages, and the grass has grown all over them. We stood on the mound, and watched the bicycling stranger nosing about like a ferret. </p><p> There is an archway in that ruin, and a flight of steps goes down—only five steps—and then it is all stopped up with fallen stones and earth. The stranger stopped at last at this arch, and stooped forward with his hands on his knees, and looked through the arch and down the steps. Then he said suddenly and fiercely: </p><p> 'Come out of it, will you?' </p><p> And the soldiers came. I wouldn't have. They were two to his one. They came cringing out like beaten dogs. The brown man made a sort of bound, and next minute the two soldiers were handcuffed together, and he was driving them before him like sheep. </p><p> 'Back you go the same way as what you come,' he said. </p><p> And then Oswald saw the soldiers' faces, and he will never forget what they looked like. </p><p> He jumped off the mound, and ran to where they were. </p><p> 'What have they done?' he asked the handcuffer. </p><p> 'Deserters,' said the man. 'Thanks to you, my lad, I got 'em as easy as kiss your hand.' </p><p> Then one of the soldiers looked at Oswald. He was not very old—about as big as a fifth-form boy. And Oswald answered what the soldier looked at him. </p><p> 'I'm not a sneak,' he said. 'I wouldn't have told if I'd known. If you'd told me, instead of saying to mind my own business I'd have helped you.' </p><p> The soldier didn't answer, but the bicycle man did. </p><p> 'Then you'd 'a helped yourself into the stone jug, my lad,' said he. 'Help a dirty deserter? You're young enough to know better. Come along, you rubbish!' </p><p> And they went. </p><p> When they were gone Dicky said: </p><p> 'It's very rum. I hate cowards. And deserters are cowards. I don't see why we feel like this.' </p><p> Alice and Dora and Noël were now discovered to be in tears. </p><p> 'Of course we did right to tell. Only when the soldier looked at me …' said Oswald. </p><p> 'Yes,' said Dicky, 'that's just it.' </p><p> In deepest gloom the party retraced its steps. </p><p> As we went, Dora said with sniffs: </p><p> 'I suppose it was the bicycle man's duty.' </p><p> 'Of course,' said Oswald, 'but it wasn't our duty. And I jolly well wish we hadn't!' </p><p> 'And such a beautiful day, too,' said Noël, sniffing in his turn. </p><p> It was beautiful. The afternoon had been dull, but now the sun was shining flat across the marshes, making everything look as if it had been covered all over with the best gold-leaf—marsh and trees, and roofs and stacks, and everything. </p><p> That evening Noël wrote a poem about it all. It began: </p><p> 'Poor soldiers, why did you run away On such a beautiful, beautiful day? If you had run away in the rain, Perhaps they would never have found you again, Because then Oswald would not have been there To show the hunter the way to your lair.' </p><p> Oswald would have licked him for that—only Noël is not very strong, and there is something about poets, however young, that makes it rather like licking a girl. So Oswald did not even say what he thought—Noël cries at the least thing. Oswald only said, 'Let's go down to our pigman.' </p><p> And we all went except Noël. He never will go anywhere when in the midst of making poetry. And Alice stayed with him, and H. O. was in bed. We told the pigman all about the deserters, and about our miserable inside remorsefulness, and he said he knew just how we felt. </p><p> 'There's quite enough agin a pore chap that's made a bolt of it without the rest of us a-joinin' in,' he said. 'Not as I holds with deserting—mean trick I call it. But all the same, when the odds is that heavy—thousands to one—all the army and the navy and the pleece and Parliament and the King agin one pore silly bloke. You wouldn't 'a done it a purpose, I lay.' </p><p> 'Not much,' said Oswald in gloomy dejection. 'Have a peppermint? They're extra strong.' </p><p> When the pigman had had one he went on talking. </p><p> 'There's a young chap, now,' he said, 'broke out of Dover Gaol. I 'appen to know what he's in for—nicked a four-pound cake, he did, off of a counter at a pastrycook's—Jenner's it was, in the High Street—part hunger, part playfulness. But even if I wasn't to know what he was lagged for, do you think I'd put the coppers on to him? Not me. Give a fellow a chance is what I say. But don't you grizzle about them there Tommies. P'raps it'll be the making of 'em in the end. A slack-baked pair as ever wore boots. I seed 'em. Only next time just you take and think afore you pipes up—see?' </p><p> We said that we saw, and that next time we would do as he said. And we went home again. As we went Dora said: </p><p> 'But supposing it was a cruel murderer that had got loose, you ought to tell then.' </p><p> 'Yes,' said Dicky; 'but before you do tell you ought to be jolly sure it is a cruel murderer, and not a chap that's taken a cake because he was hungry. How do you know what you'd do if you were hungry enough?' </p><p> 'I shouldn't steal,' said Dora. </p><p> 'I'm not so sure,' said Dicky; and they argued about it all the way home, and before we got in it began to rain in torrents. </p><p> Conversations about food always make you feel as though it was a very long time since you had had anything to eat. Mrs. Beale had gone home, of course, but we went into the larder. It is a generous larder. No lock, only a big wooden latch that pulls up with a string, like in Red Riding Hood. And the floor is clean damp red brick. It makes ginger-nuts soft if you put the bag on this floor. There was half a rhubarb pie, and there were meat turnovers with potato in them. Mrs. Beale is a thoughtful person, and I know many people much richer that are not nearly so thoughtful. </p><p> We had a comfortable feast at the kitchen table, standing up to eat, like horses. </p><p> Then we had to let Noël read us his piece of poetry about the soldier; he wouldn't have slept if we hadn't. It was very long, and it began as I have said, and ended up: </p><p>Noël owned that Hooray sounded too cheerful for the end of a poem about soldiers with faces like theirs were. </p><p> 'But I didn't mean it about the soldiers. It was about the King and Country. Half a sec. I'll put that in.' So he wrote: </p><p> 'You can't sing Hooray,' said Dicky. So Noël went to bed singing it, which was better than arguing about it, Alice said. But it was noisier as well. </p><p> Oswald and Dicky always went round the house to see that all the doors were bolted and the shutters up. This is what the head of the house always does, and Oswald is the head when father is not there. There are no shutters up-stairs, only curtains. The White House, which is Miss Sandal's house's name, is not in the village, but 'quite a step' from it, as Mrs. Beale says. It is the first house you come to as you come along the road from the marsh. </p><p> We used to look in the cupboard and under the beds for burglars every night. The girls liked us to, though they wouldn't look themselves, and I don't know that it was much good. If there is a burglar, it's sometimes safer for you not to know it. Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to find a burglar, especially as he would be armed to the teeth as likely as not. However, there is not much worth being a burglar about, in houses where the motto is plain living and high thinking, and there never was anyone in the cupboards or under the beds. </p><p> Then we put out out all the lights very carefully in case of fire—all except Noël's. He does not like the dark. He says there are things in it that go away when you light a candle, and however much you talk reason and science to him, it makes no difference at all. </p><p> Then we got into our pyjamas. It was Oswald who asked father to let us have pyjamas instead of nightgowns; they are so convenient for dressing up when you wish to act clowns, or West Indian planters, or any loose-clothed characters. Then we got into bed, and then we got into sleep. </p><p> Little did the unconscious sleepers reck of the strange destiny that was advancing on them by leaps and bounds through the silent watches of the night. </p><p> Although we were asleep, the rain went on raining just the same, and the wind blowing across the marsh with the fury of a maniac who has been transformed into a blacksmith's bellows. And through the night, and the wind, and the rain, our dreadful destiny drew nearer and nearer. I wish this to sound as if something was going to happen, and I hope it does. I hope the reader's heart is now standing still with apprehensionness on our account, but I do not want it to stop altogether, so I will tell you that we were not all going to be murdered in our beds, or pass peacefully away in our sleeps with angel-like smiles on our young and beautiful faces. Not at all. What really happened was this. Some time must have elapsed between our closing our eyes in serene slumber and the following narrative: </p><p> Oswald was awakened by Dicky thumping him hard in the back, and saying in accents of terror—at least, he says not, but Oswald knows what they sounded like: </p><p> 'What's that?' </p><p> Oswald reared up on his elbow and listened, but there was nothing to listen to except Dicky breathing like a grampus, and the giggle-guggle of the rain-water overflowing from the tub under the window. </p><p> 'What's what?' said Oswald. </p><p> He did not speak furiously, as many elder brothers would have done when suddenly awakened by thumps. </p><p> 'That!' said Dicky. 'There it is again!' </p><p> And this time, certainly, there it was, and it sounded like somebody hammering on the front-door with his fists. There is no knocker to the plain-living, high-thinking house. </p><p> Oswald controlled his fears, if he had any (I am not going to say whether he had or hadn't), and struck a match. Before the candle had had time to settle its flame after the first flare up that doesn't last, the row began again. </p><p> Oswald's nerves are of iron, but it would have given anybody a start to see two white figures in the doorway, yet so it was. They proved to be Alice and Dora in their nighties; but no one could blame anyone for not being sure of this at first. </p><p> 'Is it burglars?' said Dora; and her teeth did chatter, whatever she may say. </p><p> 'I think it's Mrs. Beale,' said Alice. 'I expect she's forgotten the key.' </p><p> Oswald pulled his watch out from under his pillow. </p><p> 'It's half-past one,' he said. </p><p> And then the knocking began again. So the intrepid Oswald went to the landing window that is over the front-door. The others went too. And he opened the window in his pyjamas and said, 'Who's there?' </p><p> There was the scraping sound of boots on the doorstep, as somebody down there stepped back. </p><p> 'Is this the way to Ashford?' said the voice of a man. </p><p> 'Ashford's thirteen miles off,' said Oswald. 'You get on to the Dover road.' </p><p> 'I don't want to get on the Dover road,' said the voice; 'I've had enough of Dover.' </p><p> A thrill ran through every heart. We all told each other so afterwards. </p><p> 'Well,' said Dicky, 'Ashford's thirteen miles——' </p><p> 'Anybody but you in the house?' </p><p> 'Say we've got men and dogs and guns,' whispered Dora. </p><p> 'There are six of us,' said Oswald, 'all armed to the teeth.' </p><p> The stranger laughed. </p><p> 'I'm not a burglar,' he said; 'I've lost my way, that's all. I thought I should have got to Ashford before dusk, but I missed the way. I've been wandering all over these marshes ever since, in the rain. I expect they're out after me now, but I'm dead beat. I can't go on. Won't you let me in? I can sit by the kitchen fire.' </p><p> Oswald drew his head back through the window, and a hasty council took place on the landing. </p><p> 'It is,' said Alice. </p><p> 'You heard what he said about Dover, and their being out after him?' </p><p> 'I say, you might let a chap in,' said the voice outside. 'I'm perfectly respectable. Upon my word I am.' </p><p> 'I wish he hadn't said that,' whispered Dora. 'Such a dreadful story! And we didn't even ask him if he was.' </p><p> 'He sounds very tired,' said Alice. </p><p> 'And wet,' said Oswald. 'I heard the water squelching in his boots.' </p><p> 'What'll happen if we don't let him in?' said Dicky. </p><p> 'He'll be caught and taken back, like the soldiers,' said Oswald. 'Look here, I'm going to chance it. You others can lock yourselves into your rooms if you're frightened.' </p><p> Then Oswald put his brave young head out of the window, and the rain dripped on to the back of his bold young neck off the roof, like a watering-pot on to a beautiful flower, and he said: </p><p> 'There's a porch to the side door. Just scoot round there and shelter, and I'll come down in half a sec.' </p><p> A resolve made in early youth never to face midnight encounters without boots was the cause of this delay. Oswald and Dicky got into their boots and jackets, and told the girls to go back to bed. </p><p> Then we went down and opened the front-door. The stranger had heard the bolts go, and he was outside waiting. </p><p> We held the door open politely, and he stepped in and began at once to drip heavily on the doormat. </p><p> We shut the door. He looked wildly round. </p><p> 'Be calm! You are safe,' said Oswald. </p><p> 'Thanks,' said the stranger; 'I see I am.' </p><p> All our hearts were full of pity for the outcast. He was, indeed, a spectacle to shock the benevolent. Even the prison people, Oswald thought, or the man he took the cake from, would have felt their fierceness fade if they could have seen him then. He was not in prison dress. Oswald would have rather liked to see that, but he remembered that it was safer for the man that he had found means to rid himself of the felon's garb. He wore a gray knickerbocker suit, covered with mud. The lining of his hat must have been blue, and it had run down his face in streaks like the gentleman in Mr. Kipling's story. He was wetter than I have ever seen anyone out of a bath or the sea. </p><p> 'Come into the kitchen,' said Oswald; 'you can drip there quite comfortably. The floor is brick.' </p><p> He followed us into the kitchen. </p><p> 'Are you kids alone in the house?' he said. </p><p> 'Yes,' said Oswald. </p><p> 'Then I suppose it's no good asking if you've got a drop of brandy?' </p><p> 'Not a bit,' said Dicky. </p><p> 'Whisky would do, or gin—any sort of spirit,' said the smeared stranger hopefully. 'Not a drop,' said Oswald; 'at least, I'll look in the medicine cupboard. And, I say, take off your things and put them in the sink. I'll get you some other clothes. There are some of Mr. Sandal's. </p><p> The man hesitated, </p><p> 'It'll make a better disguise,' said Oswald in a low, significant whisper, and turned tactfully away, so as not to make the stranger feel awkward. </p><p> Dicky got the clothes, and the stranger changed in the back-kitchen. The only spirit Oswald could find was spirits of salts, which the stranger said was poison, and spirits of camphor. Oswald gave him some of this on sugar; he knows it is a good thing when you have taken cold. The stranger hated it. He changed in the back-kitchen, and while he was doing it we tried to light the kitchen fire, but it would not; so Dicky went up to ask Alice for some matches, and finding the girls had not gone to bed as ordered, but contrarily dressed themselves, he let them come down. And then, of course, there was no reason why they should not light the fire. They did. </p><p> When the unfortunate one came out of the back-kitchen he looked quite a decent chap, though still blue in patches from the lining of his hat. Dicky whispered to me what a difference clothes made. </p><p> He made a polite though jerky bow to the girls, and Dora said: </p><p> 'How do you do? I hope you are quite well.' </p><p> 'As well as can be expected,' replied the now tidy outcast, 'considering what I've gone through.' </p><p> 'Tea or cocoa?' said Dora. 'And do you like cheese or cold bacon best?' </p><p> 'I'll leave it to you entirely,' he answered. And he added, without a pause, 'I'm sure I can trust you.' </p><p> 'Indeed you can,' said Dora earnestly; 'you needn't be a bit afraid. You're perfectly safe with us.' </p><p> He opened his eyes at this. </p><p> 'He didn't expect such kindness,' Alice whispered. 'Poor man! he's quite overcome.' </p><p> We gave him cocoa, and cheese, and bacon, and butter and bread, and he ate a great deal, with his feet in Mr. Sandal's all-wool boots on the kitchen fender. </p><p> The girls wrung the water out of his clothes, and hung them on the clothes-horse on the other side of the fire. </p><p> 'I'm sure I'm very much obliged to you,' he said; 'real charity I call this. I shan't forget it, I assure you. I ought to apologise for knocking you up like this, but I'd been hours tramping through this precious marsh of yours wet to the skin, and not a morsel of food since mid-day. And yours was the first light I'd seen for a couple of hours.' </p><p> 'I'm very glad it was us you knocked up,' said Alice. </p><p> 'So am I,' said he; 'I might have knocked at a great many doors before I got such a welcome. I'm quite aware of that.' </p><p> He spoke all right, not like a labouring man; but it wasn't a gentleman's voice, and he seemed to end his sentences off short at the end, as though he had it on the tip of his tongue to say 'Miss' or 'Sir.' </p><p> Oswald thought how terrible it must be to be out alone in the rain and the dark, with the police after you, and no one to be kind to you if you knocked at their doors. </p><p> 'You must have had an awful day,' he said. </p><p> 'I believe you,' said the stranger, cutting himself more bacon. 'Thank you, miss (he really did say it that time), just half a cup if you don't mind. I believe you! I never want to have such a day again, I can tell you. I took one or two little things in the morning, but I wasn't in the mood or something. You know how it is sometimes.' </p><p> 'I can fancy it,' said Alice. </p><p> 'And then the afternoon clouded over. It cleared up at sunset, you remember, but then it was too late. And then the rain came on. Not half! My word! I've been in a ditch. Thought my last hour had come, I tell you. Only got out by the skin of my teeth. Got rid of my whole outfit. There's a nice thing to happen to a young fellow! Upon my Sam, it's enough to make a chap swear he'll never take another thing as long as he lives.' </p><p> 'I hope you never will,' said Dora earnestly; 'it doesn't pay, you know.' </p><p> 'Upon my word, that's nearly true, though I don't know how you know,' said the stranger, beginning on the cheese and pickles. </p><p> 'I wish,' Dora was beginning, but Oswald interrupted. He did not think it was fair to preach at the man. </p><p> 'So you lost your outfit in the ditch,' he said; 'and how did you get those clothes?' </p><p> He pointed to the steaming gray suit. </p><p> 'Oh,' replied the stranger, 'the usual way.' </p><p> Oswald was too polite to ask what was the usual way of getting a gray suit to replace a prison outfit. He was afraid the usual way was the way the four-pound cake had been got. </p><p> Alice looked at me helplessly. I knew just how she felt. </p><p> Harbouring a criminal when people are 'out after him' gives you a very chilly feeling in the waistcoat—or, if in pyjamas, in the part that the plaited cotton cord goes round. By the greatest good luck there were a few of the extra-strong peppermints left. We had two each, and felt better. </p><p> The girls put the sheets off Oswald's bed on to the bed Miss Sandal used to sleep in when not in London nursing the shattered bones of her tract-distributing brother. </p><p> 'If you will go to bed now,' Oswald said to the stranger, 'we will wake you in good time. And you may sleep as sound as you like. We'll wake you all right.' </p><p> 'You might wake me about eight,' he said; 'I ought to be getting on. I'm sure I don't know what to say in return for the very handsome reception you've given me. Good-night to you all, I'm sure.' </p><p> 'Good-night,' said everyone. And Dora added, 'Don't you bother. While you're asleep we'll think what's best to be done.' </p><p> 'Don't you bother,' said the stranger, and he absently glanced at his own clothes. 'What's big enough to get out of's big enough to get into.' </p><p> Then he took the candle, and Dicky showed him to his room. </p><p> 'What's big enough to get out of,' repeated Alice. 'Surely he doesn't mean to creep back into prison, and pretend he was there all the time, only they didn't notice him?' </p><p> 'Well, what are we to do?' asked Dicky, rejoining the rest of us. 'He told me the dark room at Dover was a disgrace. Poor chap!' </p><p> 'We must invent a disguise,' said Dora. </p><p> 'Let's pretend he's our aunt, and dress him up—like in "Hard Cash,"' said Alice. </p><p> It was now three o'clock, but no one was sleepy. No one wanted to go to sleep at all till we had taken our candles up into the attic and rummaged through Miss Sandal's trunks, and found a complete disguise exactly suited to an aunt. We had everything—dress, cloak, bonnet, veil, gloves, petticoats, and even boots, though we knew all the time, in our hearts, that these were far too small. We put all ready on the parlour sofa, and then at last we began to feel in our eyes and ears and jaws how late it was. So we went back to bed. Alice said she knew how to wake exact to the minute, and we had known her do it before, so we trusted her, and agreed that she was to wake us at six. </p><p> But, alas! Alice had deemed herself cleverer than she was, by long chalks, and it was not her that woke us. </p><p> We were aroused from deep slumber by the voice of Mrs. Beale. </p><p> 'Hi!' it remarked, 'wake up, young gentlemen! It's gone the half after nine, and your gentleman friend's up and dressed and a-waiting for his breakfast.' </p><p> We sprang up. </p><p> 'I say, Mrs. Beale,' cried Oswald, who never even in sleep quite loses his presence of mind, 'don't let on to anyone that we've got a visitor.' </p><p> She went away laughing. I suppose she thought it was some silly play-secret. She little knew. </p><p> We found the stranger looking out of the window. </p><p> 'I wouldn't do that,' said Dora softly; 'it isn't safe. Suppose someone saw you?' </p><p> 'Well,' said he, 'suppose they did?' </p><p> 'They might take you, you know,' said Dora; 'it's done in a minute. We saw two poor men taken yesterday.' </p><p> Her voice trembled at the gloomy recollection. </p><p> 'Let 'em take me,' said the man who wore the clothes of the plain-living and high-thinking Mr. Sandal; 'I don't mind so long as my ugly mug don't break the camera!' </p><p> 'We want to save you,' Dora was beginning; but Oswald, far-sighted beyond his years, felt a hot redness spread over his youthful ears and right down his neck. He said: </p><p> 'Please, what were you doing in Dover? And what did you take yesterday?' </p><p> 'I was in Dover on business,' said the man, 'and what I took was Hythe Church and Burmarsh Church, and——' </p><p> 'Then you didn't steal a cake and get put into Dover Gaol, and break loose, and——' said Dicky, though I kicked him as a sign not to. </p><p> 'Me?' said our friend. 'Not exactly!' </p><p> 'Then, what are you? If you're not that poor escaped thief, what are you?' asked Dora fiercely, before Oswald could stop her. </p><p> 'I'm a photographer, miss,' said he—'a travelling photographer.' </p><p> Then slowly but surely he saw it all, and I thought he would never have done laughing. </p><p> ••••• </p><p> 'Breakfast is getting cold,' said Oswald. </p><p> 'So it is,' said our guest. 'Lordy, what a go! This'll be something to talk about between friends for many a year.' </p><p> 'No,' said Alice suddenly; 'we thought you were a runaway thief, and we wanted to help you whatever you were.' She pointed to the sofa, where the whole costume of the untrue aunt was lying in simple completeness. 'And you're in honour bound never to tell a soul. Think,' she added in persuading tones—'think of the cold bacon and the cheese, and all those pickles you had, and the fire and the cocoa, and us being up all night, and the dry all-wool boots.' </p><p> 'Say no more, miss,' said the photographer (for such he indeed was) nobly. 'Your will is my law; I won't never breathe a word.' </p><p> And he sat down to the ham and eggs as though it was weeks since he had tasted bacon. </p><p> ••••• </p><p> But we found out afterwards he went straight up to the Ship, and told everybody all about it. I wonder whether all photographers are dishonourable and ungrateful. Oswald hopes they are not, but he cannot feel at all sure. </p><p> Lots of people chaffed us about it afterwards, but the pigman said we were jolly straight young Britons, and it is something to be called that by a man you really respect. It doesn't matter so much what the other people say—the people you don't really care about. </p><p> When we told our Indian uncle about it he said, 'Nonsense! you ought never to try and shield a criminal.' But that was not at all the way we felt about it at the time when the criminal was there (or we thought he was), all wet, and hunted, and miserable, with people 'out after him.' He meant his friends who were expecting him, but we thought he meant police. It is very hard sometimes to know exactly what is right. If what feels right isn't right, how are you to know, I wonder. </p><p> ••••• </p><p> The only comforting thing about it all is that we heard next day that the soldiers had got away from the brown bicycle beast after all. I suppose it came home to them suddenly that they were two to one, and they shoved him into a ditch and got away. They were never caught; I am very glad. And I suppose that's wrong too—so many things are. But I am.</p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

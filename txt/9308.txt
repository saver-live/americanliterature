<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pardon, old fathers, if you still remain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere in ear-shot for the storys end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Dublin merchant free of ten and four
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or trading out of Galway into Spain;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And country scholar, Robert Emmets friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred-year-old memory to the poor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traders or soldiers who have left me blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has not passed through any huxters loin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pardon, and you that did not weigh the cost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Butlers when you took to horse and stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the brackish waters of the Boyne
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till your bad master blenched and all was lost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You merchant skipper that leaped overboard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a ragged hat in Biscay Bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You most of all, silent and fierce old man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you were the spectacle that stirred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fancy, and set my boyish lips to say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the wastful virtues earn the sun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pardon that for a barren passions sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have come close on forty-nine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no child, I have nothing but a book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but that to prove your blood and mine.

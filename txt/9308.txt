<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, when midnight smote the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eunuchs ran through Hell and met
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thoroughfare to thoroughfare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While that great Juan galloped by;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like these to rail and sweat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staring upon his sinewy thigh.

This passage in Milton possesses an excellence far superior to that of mere description: it is spoken in the character of the melancholy Man, and has therefore a dramatic propriety. The Author makes this remark, to rescue himself from the charge of having alluded with levity to a line in Milton: a charge than which none could be more painful to him, except perhaps that of having ridiculed his Bible.</p><h2>The Female Vagarant</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Footnote 2 (return): Several of the Lakes in the north of England are let out to different Fishermen, in parcels marked out by imaginary lines drawn from rock to rock.</p><h2>Goody Blake, and Harry Gill, A True Story</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Lines Written a Small Distance from My House, and Sent by My Little Boy</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>LINES WRITTEN AT A SMALL DISTANCE FROM MY HOUSE, AND SENT BY MY LITTLE BOY TO THE PERSON TO WHOM THEY ARE ADDRESSED.</p><h2>Simon Lee, The Old Huntsman</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>SIMON LEE, THE OLD HUNTSMAN, WITH AN INCIDENT IN WHICH HE WAS CONCERNED</p><h2>Anecdote for Fathers Shewing How the Art of Lying May Be Taught</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>We Are Seven</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Lines Written in Early Spring</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>The Thorn</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>The Last of the Flock</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>The Dungeon</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>The Mad Mother</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>The Idiot Boy</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Lines Written Near Richmond, Upon the Thames, At Evening</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Footnote 3 (return): Collins's Ode on the death of Thomson, the last written, I believe, of the poems which were published during his life-time. This Ode is also alluded to in the next stanza.</p><h2>Expostulation and Reply</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>The Tables Turned; An Evening Scene, On the Same Subject</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Old Man Travelling; Animal Tranquillity, and Decay, A Sketch</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>The Complaint of a Forsaken Indian Woman</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>[When a Northern Indian, from sickness, is unable to continue his journey with his companions; he is left behind, covered over with Deer-skins, and is supplied with water, food, and fuel if the situation of the place will afford it. He is informed of the track which his companions intend to pursue, and if he is unable to follow, or overtake them, he perishes alone in the Desart; unless he should have the good fortune to fall in with some other Tribes of Indians. It is unnecessary to add that the females are equally, or still more, exposed to the same fate. See that very interesting work, Hearne's Journey from Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean. When the Northern Lights, as the same writer informs us, vary their position in the air, they make a rustling and a crackling noise. This circumstance is alluded to in the first stanza of the following poem.]</i></p><h2>The Convict</h2><p> </p><p> &lt;</p><h2>Lines Written a Few Miles from Tintern Abbey, On Revisiting the Banks of the Wye</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>LINES WRITTEN A FEW MILES ABOVE TINTERN ABBEY, ON REVISITING THE BANKS OF THE WYE DURING A TOUR, July 13, 1798</p><p>Footnote 4 (return): The river is not affected by the tides a few miles above Tintern. </p><p>Footnote 5 (return): This line has a close resemblance to an admirable line of Young, the exact expression of which I cannot recollect.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could man be drunk for ever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With liquor, love, or fights,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lief should I rouse at morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lief lie down of nights.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But men at whiles are sober
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And think by fits and starts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if they think, they fasten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hands upon their hearts.

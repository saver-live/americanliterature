&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fame, like a wayward girl, will still be coy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who woo her with too slavish knees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But makes surrender to some thoughtless boy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dotes the more upon a heart at ease;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a Gypsy, will not speak to those
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have not learnt to be content without her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Jilt, whose ear was never whisper'd close,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thinks they scandal her who talk about her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very Gypsy is she, Nilus-born,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister-in-law to jealous Potiphar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye love-sick Bards! repay her scorn for scorn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye Artists lovelorn! madmen that ye are!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make your best bow to her and bid adieu,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if she likes it, she will follow you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"You cannot eat your cake and have it too."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Proverb.</i>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How fever'd is the man, who cannot look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his mortal days with temperate blood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who vexes all the leaves of his life's book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And robs his fair name of its maidenhood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as if the rose should pluck herself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ripe plum finger its misty bloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a Naiad, like a meddling elf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the rose leaves herself upon the briar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For winds to kiss and grateful bees to feed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undisturbed lake has crystal space;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then should man, teasing the world for grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed?

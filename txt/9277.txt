<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, that Time could touch a form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That could show what Homers age
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bred to be a heros wage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were not all her life but storm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would not painters paint a form
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such noble lines I said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a delicate high head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that sternness amid charm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that sweetness amid strength?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, but peace that comes at length,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came when Time had touched her form.

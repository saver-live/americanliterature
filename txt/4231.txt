<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Reynolds, as last night I lay in bed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There came before my eyes that wonted thread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shapes, and shadows, and remembrances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That every other minute vex and please:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things all disjointed come from north and south,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two witch's eyes above a cherub's mouth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voltaire with casque and shield and habergeon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Alexander with his nightcap on;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Socrates a-tying his cravat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth's cat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Junius Brutus, pretty well so-so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the best of's way towards Soho.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few are there who escape these visitings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one or two whose lives have patent wings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through whose curtains peeps no hellish nose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wild-boar tushes, and no mermaid's toes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But flowers bursting out with lusty pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And young AEolian harps personified;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Titian colours touch'd into real life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice goes on; the pontiff knife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleams in the sun, the milk-white heifer lows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pipes go shrilly, the libation flows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white sail shows above the green-head cliff,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves round the point, and throws her anchor stiff;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mariners join hymn with those on land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the Enchanted Castle, it doth stand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a rock on the border of a lake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nested in trees, which all do seem to shake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From some old magic like Urganda's sword.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Phoebus! that I had thy sacred word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show this Castle in fair dreaming wise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto my friend, while sick and ill he lies!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know it well enough, where it doth seem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mossy place, a Merlin's Hall, a dream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the clear lake, and the little isles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains blue, and cold near neighbour rills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All which elsewhere are but half animate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here do they look alive to love and hate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To smiles and frowns; they seem a lifted mound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above some giant, pulsing underground.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the building was a chosen See
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built by a banish'd Santon of Chaldee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part, two thousand years from him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there's a little wing, far from the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built by a Lapland witch turn'd maudlin nun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many other juts of aged stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded with many a mason-devil's groan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors all look as if they op'd themselves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows as if latch'd by fays and elves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from them comes a silver flash of light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the westward of a summer's night;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or like a beauteous woman's large blue eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone mad through olden songs and poesies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See what is coming from the distance dim!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden galley all in silken trim!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three rows of oars are lightening, moment whiles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the verdurous bosoms of those isles;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the shade under the Castle wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes in silence, now 'tis hidden all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clarion sounds, and from a postern-gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An echo of sweet music doth create
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fear in the poor herdsman who doth bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beasts to trouble the enchanted spring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tells of the sweet music and the spot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all his friends, and they believe him not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would all their colours from the sunset take:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From something of material sublime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than shadow our own soul's day-time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark void of night. For in the world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We jostle- but my flag is not unfurl'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Admiral-staff, and to philosophize
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare not yet! Oh, never will the prize,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High reason, and the lore of good and ill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be my award! Things cannot to the will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be settled, but they tease us out of thought;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or is it that Imagination brought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond its proper bound, yet still confin'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in a sort of Purgatory blind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot refer to any standard law
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of either earth or heaven? It is a flaw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In happiness to see beyond our bourn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It forces us in summer skies to mourn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It spoils the singing of the Nightingale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Reynolds! I have a mysterious tale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cannot speak it. The first page I read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a lampit rock of green sea-weed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the breakers; 'twas a quiet eve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rocks were silent, the wide sea did weave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An untumultuous fringe of silver foam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the flat brown sand; I was at home
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And should have been most happy, but I saw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too far into the sea, where every maw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater on the less feeds evermore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I saw too distinct into the core
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of an eternal fierce destruction,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so from happiness I far was gone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still am I sick of it, and though to-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've gather'd young spring-leaves, and flowers gay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of periwinkle and wild strawberry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still do I that most fierce destruction see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shark at savage prey, the Hawk at pounce,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle Robin, like a Pard or Ounce,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravening a worm, Away, ye horrid moods!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moods of one's mind! You know I hate them well.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I'd sooner be a clapping Bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some Kamschatcan Missionary Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than with these horrid moods be left i' the lurch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you get health, and Tom the same, I'll dance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from detested moods in new Romance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take refuge. Of bad lines a Centaine dose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sure enough, and so "here follows prose."

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If by dull rhymes our English must be chain'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fetter'd, in spite of pained loveliness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us find out, if we must be constrain'd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandals more interwoven and complete
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fit the naked foot of poesy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every chord, and see what may be gain'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By ear industrious, and attention meet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misers of sound and syllable, no less
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Midas of his coinage, let us be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if we may not let the Muse be free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will be bound with garlands of her own.

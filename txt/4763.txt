<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why gird at Lollius if he care
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To purchase in the cityÂ’s sight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With nard and roses for his hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Knight?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of unmitigated sires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enriched by trade in Afric corn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wealth allows, his wife requires,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him to be born.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him slaves shall serve with zeal renewed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At lesser wage for longer whiles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And school- and station-masters rude
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive with smiles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bowels shall be sought in charge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By learned doctors; all his sons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nubile daughters shall enlarge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their horizons.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fierce she-Britons, apt to smite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their upward-climbing sisters down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall smooth their plumes and oft invite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brood to town.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these delights will he disgorge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State enormous benefice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, by the head of either George,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pays not twice!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom neither lust for public pelf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor itch to make orations, vex,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content to honour his own self
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his own cheques,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That man is clean. At least, his house
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs cleanly from untainted gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not from a conscience or a spouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sold and resold.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was, you say, before men knew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such arts, and rose by Virtue guided?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tables rock with laughter, you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not least derided.

<p> We are absolutely delighted to have found a format that allows us to share some of the works of Flannery O'Connor. Here she is, reading one of her iconic short stories in her own voice. </p><p> It should be noted that this story is a Southern Grotesque and racism is part of the story. For those of you that are sensitive, you might wish to listen to the third video rather than the first. </p><p>This version is not read by the author, but the audio quality is better so if you are having difficulty hearing the O'Connor version you might wish to listen to this version.</p><p>This is the "safe space" version</p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

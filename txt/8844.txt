<p><b>I. LA VIERGE AU DONATEUR</b><br> HERE by the ample river's argent sweep,<br> Bosomed in tilth and vintage to her walls,<br> A tower-crowned Cybele in armoured sleep<br> The city lies, fat plenty in her halls,<br> With calm parochial spires that hold in fee<br> The friendly gables clustered at their base,<br> And, equipoised o'er tower and market-place,<br> The Gothic minister's winged immensity;<br> And in that narrow burgh, with equal mood,<br> Two placid hearts, to all life's good resigned,<br> Might, from the altar to the lych-gate, find<br> Long years of peace and dreamless plenitude.<br> <br> <b>II. MONA LISA</b><br> Yon strange blue city crowns a scarped steep<br> No mortal foot hath bloodlessly essayed:<br> Dreams and illusions beacon from its keep.<br> But at the gate an Angel bares his blade;<br> And tales are told of those who thought to gain<br> At dawn its ramparts; but when evening fell<br> Far off they saw each fading pinnacle<br> Lit with wild lightnings from the heaven of pain;<br> Yet there two souls, whom life's perversities<br> Had mocked with want in plenty, tears in mirth,<br> Might meet in dreams, ungarmented of earth,<br> And drain Joy's awful chalice to the lees.</p>

<p>Speak of the North! A lonely moor<br> Silent and dark and tractless swells,<br> The waves of some wild streamlet pour<br> Hurriedly through its ferny dells.<br> <br> Profoundly still the twilight air,<br> Lifeless the landscape; so we deem<br> Till like a phantom gliding near<br> A stag bends down to drink the stream.<br> <br> And far away a mountain zone,<br> A cold, white waste of snow-drifts lies,<br> And one star, large and soft and lone,<br> Silently lights the unclouded skies.</p>

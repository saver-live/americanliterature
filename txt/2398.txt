<p><cite class="al-title">The Beautiful and Damned</cite> was Fitzgerald's second novel, published in 1922. Anthony Patch is a socialite, heir to a tycoon's fortune, and an Army veteran, trying to make sense of his relationship with Gloria, his wife, while trying to manage alcoholism. It's an interesting look into how the Jazz Age swept across class and racial lines, introducing the Cafe Society.<i> [Illustration by William Ely Hill, first edition cover resembling likenesses of Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, 1922.]</i></p><p><a href="book-i-chapter-i-anthony-patch">Book I - Chapter I - Anthony Patch</a></p><p><a href="book-i-chapter-ii-portrait-of-the-siren">Book I - Chapter II - Portrait of the Siren</a></p><p><a href="book-i-chapter-iii-the-connoisseur-of-kisses">Book I - Chapter III - The Connoisseur of Kisses</a></p><p><a href="book-ii-chapter-i-the-radiant-hour">Book II - Chapter I - The Radiant Hour</a></p><p><a href="book-ii-chapter-ii-symposium">Book II - Chapter II - Symposium</a></p><p><a href="book-ii-chapter-iii-the-broken-lute">Book II - Chapter III - The Broken Lute</a></p><p><a href="book-iii-chapter-i-a-matter-of-civilization">Book III - Chapter I - A Matter of Civilization</a></p><p><a href="book-iii-chapter-ii-a-matter-of-aesthetics">Book III - Chapter II - A Matter of Aesthetics</a></p><p><a href="book-iii-chapter-iii-no-matter">Book III - Chapter III - No Matter!</a></p><p style="margin-top: 26px;"> Return to the <a href="/author/f-scott-fitzgerald">F.

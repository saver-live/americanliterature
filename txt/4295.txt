<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loves to peer up at the morning sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With half-shut eyes and comfortable cheek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him with this sweet tale full often seek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For meadows where the little rivers run;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loves to linger with that brightest one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Heaven, Hesperus, let him lowly speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These numbers to the night and starlight meek,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or moon, if that her hunting be begun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who knows these delights, and, too, is prone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To moralize upon a smile or tear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will find at once a region of his own,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bower for his spirit, and will steer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleys where the fir-tree drops its cone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where robins hop, and fallen leaves are sear.

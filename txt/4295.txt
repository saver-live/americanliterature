<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What though while the wonders of nature exploring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot your light, mazy footsteps attend;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor listen to accents, that almost adoring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bless Cynthia's face, the enthusiasts friend:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet over the steep, whence the mountain stream rushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With you, kindest friends, in idea I rove;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark the clear tumbling crystal, its passionate gushes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its spray that the wild flower kindly bedews.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why linger you so, the wild labyrinth strolling?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why breathless, unable your bliss to declare?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! you list to the nightingales tender condoling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive to sylphs, in the moon beamy air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis morn, and the flowers with dew are yet drooping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see you are treading the verge of the sea:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now! ah, I see it, you just now are stooping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pick up the keep-sake intended for me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a cherub, on pinions of silver descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had brought me a gem from the fret-work of heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiles, with his star-cheering voice sweetly blending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blessings of Tighe had melodiously given;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had not created a warmer emotion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the present, fair nymphs, I was blest with from you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the shell, from the bright golden sands of the ocean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the emerald waves at your feet gladly threw.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, indeed, 'tis a sweet and peculiar pleasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And blissful is he who such happiness finds,)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To possess but a span of the hour of leisure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In elegant, pure, and aerial minds.

<p>Do tell when shall we make common sense men out of the owl-eyed pundits<br> Out of The Frog-faced stupid old God-born Pundits who lost in a fog-bank<br> Strut about all along shore there somewhere close by the Down East<br> Frog Duck Pond munching of pea nuts and pumpkins and buried in big-wigs<br> Why ask who ever yet saw money made out of a fat old<br> Jew or downright upright nutmegs out of a pine-knot</p>

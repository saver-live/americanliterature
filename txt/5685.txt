<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the forest primeval.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the forest primeval; but where are the hearts that beneath it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaped like the roe, when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the thatch-roofed village, the home of Acadian farmers,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of heaven?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waste are those pleasant farms, and the farmers forever departed!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered like dust and leaves, when the mighty blasts of October
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seize them, and whirl them aloft, and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of Grand-Pre.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who believe in affection that hopes, and endures, and is patient,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye who believe in the beauty and strength of woman's devotion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;List to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;List to a Tale of Love in Acadie, home of the happy.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PART THE FIRST

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand-Pre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay in the fruitful valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vast meadows stretched to the eastward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving the village its name, and pasture to flocks without number.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dikes, that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut out the turbulent tides; but at stated seasons the flood-gates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened, and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West and south there were fields of flax, and orchards and cornfields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain; and away to the northward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft on the mountains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked on the happy valley, but ne'er from their station descended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of hemlock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thatched were the roofs, with dormer-windows; and gables projecting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the tranquil evenings of summer, when brightly the sunset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarlet and blue and green, with distaffs spinning the golden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy shuttles within doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverend walked he among them; and up rose matrons and maidens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the laborers home from the field, and serenely the sun sank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon from the belfry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelt in the love of God and of man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike were they free from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat apart from the village, and nearer the Basin of Minas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer of Grand-Pre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwelt on his goodly acres: and with him, directing his household,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle Evangeline lived, his child, and the pride of the village.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearty and hale was he, an oak that is covered with snow-flakes;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White as the snow were his locks, and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen summers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth was the maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairer was she when, on Sunday morn, while the bell from its turret
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the priest with his hyssop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters blessings upon them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the long street she passed, with her chaplet of beads and her missal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing her Norman cap and her kirtle of blue, and the ear-rings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought in the olden time from France, and since, as an heirloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handed down from mother to child, through long generations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a celestial brightness--a more ethereal beauty--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone on her face and encircled her form, when, after confession,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward serenely she walked with God's benediction upon her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the house of the farmer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea; and a shady
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sycamore grew by the door, with a woodbine wreathing around it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudely carved was the porch, with seats beneath; and a footpath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led through an orchard wide, and disappeared in the meadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built o'er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther down, on the slope of the hill, was the well with its moss-grown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shielding the house from storms, on the north, were the barns and the farm-yard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were the folds for the sheep; and there, in his feathered seraglio,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock, with the selfsame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a village.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch; and a staircase,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sheltering eaves, led up to the odorous corn-loft.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There too the dove-cot stood, with its meek and innocent inmates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmuring ever of love; while above in the variant breezes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, at peace with God and the world, the farmer of Grand-Pre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived on his sunny farm, and Evangeline governed his household.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a youth, as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a suitor came to her door, by the darkness befriended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew not which beat the louder, his heart or the knocker of iron;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolder grew, and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurried words of love, that seemed a part of the music.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, among all who came, young Gabriel only was welcome;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel Lajeunesse, the son of Basil the blacksmith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was a mighty man in the village, and honored of all men;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, since the birth of time, throughout all ages and nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basil was Benedict's friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their children from earliest childhood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew up together as brother and sister; and Father Felician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priest and pedagogue both in the village, had taught them their letters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the selfsame book, with the hymns of the church and the plain-song.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the hymn was sung, and the daily lesson completed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There at the door they stood, with wondering eyes to behold him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nailing the shoe in its place; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay like a fiery snake, coiled round in a circle of cinders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft on autumnal eves, when without in the gathering darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bursting with light seemed the smithy, through every cranny and crevice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as its panting ceased, and the sparks expired in the ashes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrily laughed, and said they were nuns going into the chapel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft on sledges in winter, as swift as the swoop of the eagle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the hillside hounding, they glided away o'er the meadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone, which the swallow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus passed a few swift years, and they no longer were children.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a valiant youth, and his face, like the face of the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gladdened the earth with its light, and ripened thought into action.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a woman now, with the heart and hopes of a woman.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sunshine of Saint Eulalie" was she called; for that was the sunshine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, as the farmers believed, would load their orchards with apples
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, too, would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now had the season returned, when the nights grow colder and longer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air, from the ice-bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the winds of September
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bees, with prophetic instinct of want, had hoarded their honey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the hives overflowed; and the Indian bunters asserted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold would the winter be, for thick was the fur of the foxes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the advent of autumn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then followed that beautiful season,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the restless heart of the ocean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was for a moment consoled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sounds were in harmony blended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of children at play, the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whir of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing of pigeons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love, and the great sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright with the sheen of the dew, each glittering tree of the forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jewels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day with its burden and heat had departed, and twilight descending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought back the evening star to the sky, and the herds to the homestead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pawing the ground they came, and resting their necks on each other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foremost, bearing the bell, Evangeline's beautiful heifer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud of her snow-white hide, and the ribbon that waved from her collar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly paced and slow, as if conscious of human affection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was their favorite pasture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them followed the watch-dog,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient, full of importance, and grand in the pride of his instinct,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking from side to side with a lordly air, and superbly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the stragglers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept; their protector,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When from the forest at night, through the starry silence, the wolves howled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains from the marshes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with its odor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerily neighed the steeds, with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with tassels of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded their udders
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the milkmaid's hand; whilst loud and in regular cadence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoed back by the barns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon they sank into stillness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the valves of the barn-doors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rattled the wooden bars, and all for a season was silent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace, idly the farmer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggled together like foes in a burning city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodding and mocking along the wall, with gestures fantastic,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed in the flickering light, and the pewter plates on the dresser
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols of Christmas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers before him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close at her father's side was the gentle Evangeline seated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spinning flax for the loom, that stood in the corner behind her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed the old man's songs and united the fragments together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in a church, when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of the priest at the altar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in each pause of the song, with measured motion the clock clicked.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus as they sat, there were footsteps heard, and, suddenly lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung back on its hinges.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome!" the farmer exclaimed, as their footsteps paused on the threshold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, Basil, my friend!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, take thy place on the settle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by the chimney-side, which is always empty without thee;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with a smile of content, thus answered Basil the blacksmith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benedict Bellefontaine, thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others are filled with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin before them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he slowly continued:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ride in the Gaspereau's mouth, with their cannon pointed against us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What their design may be is unknown; but all are commanded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morrow to meet in the church, where his Majesty's mandate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be proclaimed as law in the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! in the mean time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then made answer the farmer:--"Perhaps some friendlier purpose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings these ships to our shores.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the harvests in England
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so thinketh the folk in the village," said, warmly, the blacksmith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking his head, as in doubt; then, heaving a sigh, he continued:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau Sejour, nor Port Royal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk on its outskirts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arms have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safer within these peaceful dikes, besieged by the ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than our fathers in forts, besieged by the enemy's cannon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear no evil, my friend, and to-night may no shadow of sorrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall on this house and hearth; for this is the night of the contract.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built are the house and the barn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merry lads of the village
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly have built them and well; and, breaking the glebe round about them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the barn with hay, and the house with food for a twelvemonth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rene Leblanc will be here anon, with his papers and inkhorn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the joy of our children?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As apart by the window she stood, with her hand in her lover's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as they died on his lips, the worthy notary entered.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maize, hung
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and glasses with horn bows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children's children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, though warier grown, without all guile or suspicion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple, and childlike.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the white Letiche, the ghost of a child who unchristened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the marvellous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly extending his right hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father Leblanc," he exclaimed, "thou hast heard the talk in the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, perchance, canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am never the wiser;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what their errand may be I know not better than others.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why then molest us?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God's name!" shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must we in all things look for the how, and the why, and the wherefore?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily injustice is done, and might is the right of the strongest!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, without heeding his warmth, continued the notary public,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that often consoled me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the old man's favorite tale, and he loved to repeat it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer remember,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statue of Justice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice presided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and homes of the people.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruled with an iron rod.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it chanced in a nobleman's palace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a necklace of pearls was lost, and erelong a suspicion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! o'er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts of the thunder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath from its left hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was ended, the blacksmith
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood like a man who fain would speak, but findeth no language;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face, as the vapors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard with home-brewed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pre;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well were completed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the notary rising, and blessing the bride and the bridegroom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiping the foam from his lip, he solemnly bowed and departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon was the game begun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In friendly contention the old men
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful manoeuver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was made in the king-row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile apart, in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the lovers, and whispered together, beholding the moon rise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was the evening passed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon the bell from the belfry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingered long in Evangeline's heart, and filled it with gladness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent she passed the hall, and entered the door of her chamber.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of white, and its clothes-press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linen and woollen stuffs, by the hand of Evangeline woven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of her skill as a housewife.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as she stood with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little she dreamed that below, among the trees of the orchard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a feeling of sadness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed o'er her soul, as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar!


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pre.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasantly gleamed in the soft, sweet air the Basin of Minas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the ships, with their wavering shadows, were riding at anchor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life had long been astir in the village, and clamorous labor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now from the country around, from the farms and neighboring hamlets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the bright air brighter, as up from the numerous meadows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group after group appeared, and joined, or passed on the highway.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of labor were silenced.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thronged were the streets with people; and noisy groups at the house-doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat in the cheerful sun, and rejoiced and gossiped together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed and feasted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For with this simple people, who lived like brothers together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things were held in common, and what one had was another's.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet under Benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright was her face with smiles, and words of welcome and gladness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell from her beautiful lips, and blessed the cup as she gave it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the open sky, in the odorous air of the orchard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stript of its golden fruit, was spread the feast of betrothal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There good Benedict sat, and sturdy Basil the blacksmith.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far withdrawn from these, by the cider-press and the beehives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael the fiddler was placed, with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair, as it waved in the wind; and the jolly face of the fiddler
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres, and Le Carillon de Dunkerque,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrily, merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old folk and young together, and children mingled among them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairest of all the maids was Evangeline, Benedict's daughter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel, son of the blacksmith!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the morning away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! with a summons sonorous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thronged erelong was the church with men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without, in the churchyard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited the women.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered the sacred portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With loud and dissonant clangor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then uprose their commander, and spoke from the steps of the altar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the royal commission.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are convened this day," he said, "by his Majesty's orders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your own hearts reply!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my natural make and my temper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this province
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be transported to other lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God grant you may dwell there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoners now I declare you; for such is his Majesty's pleasure!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their enclosures;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the door-way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang through the house of prayer; and high o'er the heads of the others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the altar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake he, as, after the tocsin's alarum, distinctly the clock strikes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, 'O Father, forgive them!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us repeat it now, and say, 'O Father, forgive them!'"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they repeated his prayer, and said, "O Father, forgive them!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the evening service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tapers gleamed from the altar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not with their lips alone, but their hearts; and the Ave Maria
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their souls, with devotion translated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose on the ardor of prayer, like Elijah ascending to heaven.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill, and on all sides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered, wailing, from house to house the women and children.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long at her father's door Evangeline stood, with her right hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun, that, descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted the village street with mysterious splendor, and roofed each
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peasant's cottage with golden thatch, and emblazoned its windows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the wheaten loaf, and the honey fragrant with wild-flowers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the tankard of ale, and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, at the head of the board, the great arm-chair of the farmer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did Evangeline wait at her father's door, as the sunset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charity, meekness, love, and hope, and forgiveness, and patience!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, all-forgetful of self, she wandered into the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged by their household cares, and the weary feet of their children.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down sank the great red sun, and in golden, glimmering vapors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veiled the light of his face, like the Prophet descending from Sinai.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, amid the gloom, by the church Evangeline lingered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was silent within; and in vain at the door and the windows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood she, and listened and looked, till, overcome by emotion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel!" cried she aloud with tremulous voice; but no answer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from the graves of the dead, nor the gloomier grave of the living.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smouldered the fire on the hearth, on the board was the supper untasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empty and drear was each room, and haunted with phantoms of terror.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keenly the lightning flashed; and the voice of the echoing thunder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told her that God was in heaven, and governed the world he created!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soothed was her troubled soul, and she peacefully slumbered till morning.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four times the sun had risen and set; and now on the fifth day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farm-house.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon o'er the yellow fields, in silent and mournful procession,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the Acadian women,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea-shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close at their sides their children ran, and urged on the oxen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth they hurried; and there on the sea-beach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day long the wains came laboring down from the village.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late in the afternoon, when the sun was near to his setting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither the women and children thronged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a sudden the church-doors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened, and forth came the guard, and marching in gloomy procession
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient, Acadian farmers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as pilgrims, who journey afar from their homes and their country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing as they go, and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with songs on their lips the Acadian peasants descended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from the church to the shore, amid their wives and their daughters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foremost the young men came; and, raising together their voices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang with tremulous lips a chant of the Catholic Missions:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sacred heart of the Saviour!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O inexhaustible fountain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the old men, as they marched, and the women that stood by the wayside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in the sunshine above them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of spirits departed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-way down to the shore Evangeline waited in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not overcome with grief, but strong in the hour of affliction,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calmly and sadly she waited, until the procession approached her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with emotion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team then filled her eyes, and, eagerly running to meet him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his shoulder, and whispered,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel! be of good cheer! for if we love one another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever mischances may happen!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling she spake these words; then suddenly paused, for her father
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw she slowly advancing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! how changed was his aspect!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone was the glow from his cheek, and the fire from his eye, and his footstep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with a smile and a sigh, she clasped his neck and embraced him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left on the land, extending their arms, with wildest entreaties.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood with her father.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half the task was not done when the sun went down, and the twilight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepened and darkened around; and in haste the refluent ocean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fled away from the shore, and left the line of the sand-beach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and the slippery sea-weed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to a gypsy camp, or a leaguer after a battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All escape cut off by the sea, and the sentinels near them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay encamped for the night the houseless Acadian farmers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles, and leaving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as the night descended, the herds returned from their pastures;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowing they waited, and long, at the well-known bars of the farm-yard,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence reigned in the streets; from the church no Angelus sounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose no smoke from the roofs, and gleamed no lights from the windows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices of women were heard, and of men, and the crying of children.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward from fire to fire, as from hearth to hearth in his parish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered the faithful priest, consoling and blessing and cheering,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's desolate sea-shore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he approached the place where Evangeline sat with her father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haggard and hollow and wan, and without either thought or emotion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly Evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly offered him food; yet he moved not, he looked not, he spake not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, with a vacant stare, ever gazed at the flickering fire-light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benedicite!" murmured the priest, in tones of compassion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More he fain would have said, but his heart was full, and his accents
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faltered and paused on his lips, as the feet of a child on a threshold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful presence of sorrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently, therefore, he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sat he down at her side, and they wept together in silence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly rose from the south a light, as in autumn the blood-red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling huge shadows together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships that lay in the roadstead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and, uplifting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred house-tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless at first they stood, then cried aloud in their anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pre!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking the day had dawned; and anon the lowing of cattle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came on the evening breeze, by the barking of dogs interrupted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rose a sound of dread, such as startles the sleeping encampments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the Nebraska,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the sound that arose on the night, as the herds and the horses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke through their folds and fences, and madly rushed o'er the meadows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless, the priest and the maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! from his seat he had fallen, and stretched abroad on the sea-shore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless lay his form, from which the soul had departed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head, and the maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt at her father's side, and wailed aloud in her terror.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in a swoon she sank, and lay with her head on his bosom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the long night she lay in deep, oblivious slumber;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when she woke from the trance, she beheld a multitude near her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faces of friends she beheld, that were mournfully gazing upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallid, with tearful eyes, and looks of saddest compassion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reddened the sky overhead, and gleamed on the faces around her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a familiar voice she heard, as it said to the people,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us bury him here by the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a happier season
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the words of the priest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there in haste by the sea-side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But without bell or book, they buried the farmer of Grand-Pre.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! with a mournful sound, like the voice of a vast congregation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar with the dirges.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the returning tide, that afar from the waste of the ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first dawn of the day, came heaving and hurrying landward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving behind them the dead on the shore, and the village in ruins.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PART THE SECOND

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a weary year had passed since the burning of Grand-Pre,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing a nation, with all its household gods, into exile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exile without an end, and without an example in story.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far asunder, on separate coasts, the Acadians landed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered were they, like flakes of snow, when the wind from the northeast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the Banks of Newfoundland.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendless, homeless, hopeless, they wandered from city to city,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cold lakes of the North to sultry Southern savannas,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the Father of Waters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seizes the hills in his hands, and drags them down to the ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends they sought and homes; and many, despairing, heart-broken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked of the earth but a grave, and no longer a friend nor a fireside.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowly and meek in spirit, and patiently suffering all things.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair was she and young; but, alas! before her extended,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreary and vast and silent, the desert of life, with its pathway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passions long extinguished, and hopes long dead and abandoned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the emigrant's way o'er the Western desert is marked by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camp-fires long consumed, and bones that bleach in the sunshine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something there was in her life incomplete, imperfect, unfinished;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a morning of June, with all its music and sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly paused in the sky, and, fading, slowly descended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the east again, from whence it late had arisen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes she lingered in towns, till, urged by the fever within her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged by a restless longing, the hunger and thirst of the spirit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would commence again her endless search and endeavor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes in churchyards strayed, and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat by some nameless grave, and thought that perhaps in its bosom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was already at rest, and she longed to slumber beside him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a rumor, a hearsay, an inarticulate whisper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was long ago, in some far-off place or forgotten.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel Lajeunesse!" they said; "yes! we have seen him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was with Basil the blacksmith, and both have gone to the prairies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coureurs-des-Bois are they, and famous hunters and trappers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel Lajeunesse!" said others; "O yes! we have seen him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a Voyageur in the lowlands of Louisiana."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then would they say, "Dear child! why dream and wait for him longer?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there not other youths as fair as Gabriel? others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have hearts as tender and true, and spirits as loyal?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is Baptiste Leblanc, the notary's son, who has loved thee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a tedious year; come, give him thy hand and be happy!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art too fair to be left to braid St. Catherine's tresses."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then would Evangeline answer, serenely but sadly, "I cannot!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whither my heart has gone, there follows my hand, and not elsewhere.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when the heart goes before, like a lamp, and illumines the pathway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things are made clear, that else lie hidden in darkness."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon the priest, her friend and father-confessor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, with a smile, "O daughter! thy God thus speaketh within thee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk not of wasted affection, affection never was wasted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it enrich not the heart of another, its waters, returning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to their springs, like the rain, shall fill them full of refreshment;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience; accomplish thy labor; accomplish thy work of affection!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow and silence are strong, and patient endurance is godlike.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore accomplish thy labor of love, till the heart is made godlike,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purified, strengthened, perfected, and rendered more worthy of heaven!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheered by the good man's words, Evangeline labored and waited.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered, "Despair not?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bleeding, barefooted, over the shards and thorns of existence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me essay, O Muse! to follow the wanderer's footsteps;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not through each devious path, each changeful year of existence;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from its margin at times, and seeing the gleam of its water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here and there, in some open space, and at intervals only;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then drawing nearer its banks, through sylvan glooms that conceal it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he behold it not, he can hear its continuous murmur;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy, at length, if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the month of May.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far down the Beautiful River,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the Ohio shore and past the mouth of the Wabash,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the golden stream of the broad and swift Mississippi,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated a cumbrous boat, that was rowed by Acadian boatmen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a band of exiles: a raft, as it were, from the shipwrecked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation, scattered along the coast, now floating together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men and women and children, who, guided by hope or by hearsay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought for their kith and their kin among the few-acred farmers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Acadian coast, and the prairies of fair Opelousas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them Evangeline went, and her guide, the Father Felician.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward o'er sunken sands, through a wilderness sombre with forests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day they glided adown the turbulent river;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night after night, by their blazing fires, encamped on its borders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now through rushing chutes, among green islands, where plumelike
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cotton-trees nodded their shadowy crests, they swept with the current,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then emerged into broad lagoons, where silvery sand-bars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay in the stream, and along the wimpling waves of their margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining with snow-white plumes, large flocks of pelicans waded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level the landscape grew, and along the shores of the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaded by china-trees, in the midst of luxuriant gardens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the houses of planters, with negro-cabins and dove-cots.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where through the Golden Coast, and groves of orange and citron,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, too, swerved from their course; and, entering the Bayou of Plaquemine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, like a network of steel, extended in every direction.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met in a dusky arch, and trailing mosses in mid-air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deathlike the silence seemed, and unbroken, save by the herons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home to their roasts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by the owl, as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamlike, and indistinct, and strange were all things around them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange forebodings of ill, unseen and that cannot be compassed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad forebodings of evil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision, that faintly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in his place, at the prow of the boat, rose one of the oarsmen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as a signal sound, if others like them peradventure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams, blew a blast on his bugle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the seal of silence, and giving tongues to the forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the watery floor, and beneath the reverberant branches;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not a voice replied; no answer came from the darkness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when the echoes had ceased, like a sense of pain was the silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Evangeline slept; but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent at times, then singing familiar Canadian boat-songs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as they sang of old on their own Acadian rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off,--indistinct,--as of wave or wind in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades; and before them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay, in the golden sun, the lakes of the Atchafalaya.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by the passing oars, and, resplendent in beauty, the lotus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the heat of noon; and numberless sylvan islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near to whose shores they glided along, invited to slumber.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the boughs of Wachita willows, that grew by the margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safely their boat was moored; and scattered about on the greensward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired with their midnight toil, the weary travellers slumbered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swinging from its great arms, the trumpet-flower and the grapevine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of Jacob,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending, descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the swift humming-birds, that flitted from blossom to blossom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled was her heart with love, and the dawn of an opening heaven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer, ever nearer, among the numberless islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darted a light, swift boat, that sped away o'er the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northward its prow was turned, to the land of the bison and beaver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the helm sat a youth, with countenance thoughtful and careworn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow, and a sadness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel was it, who, weary with waiting, unhappy and restless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly they glided along, close under the lee of the island,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the opposite bank, and behind a screen of palmettos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that they saw not the boat, where it lay concealed in the willows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All undisturbed by the dash of their oars, and unseen, were the sleepers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel of God was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly they glided away, like the shade of a cloud on the prairie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a magic trance the sleepers awoke, and the maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said with a sigh to the friendly priest, "O Father Felician!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel wanders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a foolish dream, an idle and vague superstition?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or has an angel passed, and revealed the truth to my spirit?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with a blush, she added, "Alas for my credulous fancy!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But made answer the reverend man, and he smiled as he answered,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daughter, thy words are not idle; nor are they to me without meaning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling is deep and still; and the word that floats on the surface
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the anchor is hidden.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel truly is near thee; for not far away to the southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the banks of the Teche, are the towns of St. Maur and St. Martin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the long-wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the long-absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful is the land, with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the feet a garden of flowers, and the bluest of heavens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending above, and resting its dome on the walls of the forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who dwell there have named it the Eden of Louisiana."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly the evening came.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun from the western horizon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twinkling vapors arose; and sky and water and forest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging between two skies, a cloud with edges of silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on the motionless water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled was Evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched by the magic spell, the sacred fountains of feeling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and waters around her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from a neighboring thicket the mocking-bird, wildest of singers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plaintive at first were the tones and sad; then soaring to madness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful, low lamentation;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, having gathered them all, he flung them abroad in derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when, after a storm, a gust of wind through the tree-tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a prelude as this, and hearts that throbbed with emotion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly they entered the Teche, where it flows through the green Opelousas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, through the amber air, above the crest of the woodland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant lowing of cattle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near to the bank of the river, o'ershadowed by oaks, from whose branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the Druids cut down with golden hatchets at Yule-tide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood, secluded and still, the house of the herdsman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A garden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the air with fragrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house itself was of timbers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully fitted together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large and low was the roof; and on slender columns supported,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose-wreathed, vine-encircled, a broad and spacious veranda,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended around it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each end of the house, amid the flowers of the garden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stationed the dove-cots were, as love's perpetual symbol,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenes of endless wooing, and endless contentions of rivals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence reigned o'er the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of shadow and sunshine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house itself was in shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly expanding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rear of the house, from the garden gate, ran a pathway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full in his track of light, like ships with shadowy canvas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grapevines.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and stirrups,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about him were numberless herds of kine, that were grazing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the vapory freshness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That uprose from the river, and spread itself over the landscape.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side, and expanding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast, that resounded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as the herdsman turned to the house, through the gate of the garden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement, and forward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed their friendly embraces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark doubts and misgivings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stole o'er the maiden's heart; and Basil, somewhat embarrassed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the silence and said, "If you came by the Atchafalaya,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel's boat on the bayous?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a shade passed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a tremulous accent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gone? is Gabriel gone?" and, concealing her face on his shoulder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the good Basil said,--and his voice grew blithe as he said it,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be of good cheer, my child; it is only to-day he departed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moody and restless grown, and tried and troubled, his spirit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful ever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his troubles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought me, and sent him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the fugitive lover;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and away to-morrow, and through the red dew of the morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will follow him fast, and bring him back to his prison."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then glad voices were heard, and up from the banks of the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael the fiddler.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long under Basil's roof had he lived like a god on Olympus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live Michael," they cried, "our brave Acadian minstrel!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession; and straightway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Felician advanced with Evangeline, greeting the old man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while Basil, enraptured,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers and daughters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his domains and his herds, and his patriarchal demeanor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the prairie; whose numberless herds were his who would take them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they ascended the steps, and, crossing the breezy veranda,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered the hall of the house, where already the supper of Basil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was silent without, and, illuming the landscape with silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars; but within doors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from his station aloft, at the head of the table, the herdsman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and smiled as they listened:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome once more, my friends, who long have been friendless and homeless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome once more to a home, that is better perchance than the old one!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom; and grass grows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, too, numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, too, lands may be had for the asking, and forests of timber
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After your houses are built, and your fields are yellow with harvests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No King George of England shall drive you away from your homesteads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burning your dwellings and barns, and stealing your farms and your cattle."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking these words, he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his huge, brown hand came thundering down on the table,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the guests all started; and Father Felician, astounded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff half-way to his nostrils.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the brave Basil resumed, and his words were milder and gayer:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only beware of the fever, my friends, beware of the fever!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it is not like that of our cold Acadian climate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were voices heard at the door, and footsteps approaching
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the neighboring Creoles and small Acadian planters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the Herdsman.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend clasped friend in his arms; and they who before were as strangers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting in exile, became straightway as friends to each other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the neighboring hall a strain of music, proceeding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the accordant strings of Michael's melodious fiddle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke up all further speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away, like children delighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things forgotten beside, they gave themselves to the maddening
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirl of the dizzy dance, as it swept and swayed to the music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, apart, at the head of the hall, the priest and the herdsman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat, conversing together of past and present and future;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for within her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of the music
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard she the sound of the sea, and an irrepressible sadness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came o'er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful was the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the black wall of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the river
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer and round about her, the manifold flowers of the garden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poured out their souls in odors, that were their prayers and confessions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuller of fragrance than they, and as heavy with shadows and night-dews,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung the heart of the maiden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm and the magical moonlight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, through the garden gate, and beneath the shade of the oak-trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and fire-flies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a hand had appeared and written upon them, "Upharsin."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soul of the maiden, between the stars and the fire-flies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered alone, and she cried, "O Gabriel!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my beloved!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou so near unto me, and yet I cannot behold thee?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou so near unto me, and yet thy voice does not reach me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! how often beneath this oak, returning from labor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shall these eyes behold, these arms be folded about thee?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a flute in the woods; and anon, through the neighboring thickets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Patience!" whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, from the moonlit meadow, a sigh responded, "To-morrow!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright rose the sun next day; and all the flowers of the garden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathed his shining feet with their tears, and anointed his tresses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" said the priest, as he stood at the shadowy threshold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from his fasting and famine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, too, the Foolish Virgin, who slept when the bridegroom was coming."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell!" answered the maiden, and, smiling, with Basil descended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the river's brink, where the boatmen already were waiting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus beginning their journey with morning, and sunshine, and gladness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that day, nor the next, nor yet the day that succeeded,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found they trace of his course, in lake or forest or river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, after many days, had they found him; but vague and uncertain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate Country;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, at the little inn of the Spanish town of Adayes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary and worn, they alighted, and learned from the garrulous landlord,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That on the day before, with horses and guides and companions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel left the village, and took the road of the prairies.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in the West there lies a desert land, where the mountains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift, through perpetual snows, their lofty and luminous summits.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from their jagged, deep ravines, where the gorge, like a gateway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward the Oregon flows and the Walleway and Owyhee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eastward, with devious course, among the Wind-river Mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Sweet-water Valley precipitate leaps the Nebraska;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the south, from Fontaine-qui-bout and the Spanish sierras,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fretted with sands and rocks, and swept by the wind of the desert,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numberless torrents, with ceaseless sound, descend to the ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the great chords of a harp, in loud and solemn vibrations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading between these streams are the wondrous, beautiful prairies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them wandered the buffalo herds, and the elk and the roebuck;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them wandered the wolves, and herds of riderless horses;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fires that blast and blight, and winds that are weary with travel;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over them wander the scattered tribes of Ishmael's children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staining the desert with blood; and above their terrible war-trails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circles and sails aloft, on pinions majestic, the vulture,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here and there rise groves from the margins of swift-running rivers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grim, taciturn bear, the anchorite monk of the desert,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook-side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over all is the sky, the clear and crystalline heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the protecting hand of God inverted above them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into this wonderful land, at the base of the Ozark Mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel far had entered, with hunters and trappers behind him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day, with their Indian guides, the maiden and Basil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed his flying steps, and thought each day to o'ertake him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes they saw, or thought they saw, the smoke of his camp-fire
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise in the morning air from the distant plain; but at nightfall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they had reached the place, they found only embers and ashes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope still guided them on, as the magic Fata Morgana
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated and vanished before them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, as they sat by their evening fire, there silently entered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the little camp an Indian woman, whose features
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as great as her sorrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel Camanches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where her Canadian husband, a Coureur-des-Bois, had been murdered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched were their hearts at her story, and warmest and friendliest welcome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave they, with words of cheer, and she sat and feasted among them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when their meal was done, and Basil and all his companions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept where the quivering fire-light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their forms wrapped up in their blankets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at the door of Evangeline's tent she sat and repeated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, with soft, low voice, and the charm of her Indian accent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the tale of her love, with its pleasures, and pains, and reverses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much Evangeline wept at the tale, and to know that another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She in turn related her love and all its disasters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat, and when she had ended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still was mute; but at length, as if a mysterious horror
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed through her brain, she spake, and repeated the tale of the Mowis;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mowis, the bridegroom of snow, who won and wedded a maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, when the morning came, arose and passed from the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till she beheld him no more, though she followed far into the forest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in those sweet, low tones, that seemed like a weird incantation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau, who was wooed by a phantom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, through the pines o'er her father's lodge, in the hush of the twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed like the evening wind, and whispered love to the maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nevermore returned, nor was seen again by her people.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent with wonder and strange surprise, Evangeline listened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the soft flow of her magical words, till the region around her
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy guest the enchantress.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the moon rose,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighting the little tent, and with a mysterious splendor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and filling the woodland.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a delicious sound the brook rushed by, and the branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled with the thoughts of love was Evangeline's heart, but a secret,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no earthly fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breath from the region of spirits
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to float in the air of night; and she felt for a moment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was pursuing a phantom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this thought she slept, and the fear and the phantom had vanished.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early upon the morrow the march was resumed; and the Shawnee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, as they journeyed along, "On the western slope of these mountains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much he teaches the people, and tells them of Mary and Jesus;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud laugh their hearts with joy, and weep with pain, as they hear him."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with a sudden and secret emotion, Evangeline answered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us go to the Mission, for there good tidings await us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither they turned their steeds; and behind a spur of the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the sun went down, they heard a murmur of voices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a meadow green and broad, by the bank of a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of the Jesuit Mission.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a towering oak, that stood in the midst of the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crucifix fastened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High on the trunk of the tree, and overshadowed by grapevines,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was their rural chapel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aloft, through the intricate arches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its aerial roof, arose the chant of their vespers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent, with heads uncovered, the travellers, nearer approaching,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the evening devotions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the service was done, and the benediction had fallen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth from the hands of the priest, like seed from the hands of the sower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers, and bade them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome; and when they replied, he smiled with benignant expression,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the homelike sounds of his mother-tongue in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with words of kindness, conducted them into his wigwam.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There upon mats and skins they reposed, and on cakes of the maize-ear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feasted, and slaked their thirst from the water-gourd of the teacher.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon was their story told; and the priest with solemnity answered:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not six suns have risen and set since Gabriel, seated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this mat by my side, where now the maiden reposes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft was the voice of the priest, and he spake with an accent of kindness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on Evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far to the north he has gone," continued the priest; "but in autumn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the chase is done, will return again to the Mission."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Evangeline said, and her voice was meek and submissive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me remain with thee, for my soul is sad and afflicted."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So seemed it wise and well unto all; and betimes on the morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounting his Mexican steed, with his Indian guides and companions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward Basil returned, and Evangeline stayed at the Mission.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, slowly, slowly the days succeeded each other,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days and weeks and months; and the fields of maize that were springing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green from the ground when a stranger she came, now waving above her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted their slender shafts, with leaves interlacing, and forming
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the golden weather the maize was husked, and the maidens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushed at each blood-red ear, for that betokened a lover,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the crooked laughed, and called it a thief in the corn-field.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought not her lover.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Patience!" the priest would say; "have faith, and thy prayer will be answered!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See how its leaves are turned to the north, as true as the magnet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the compass-flower, that the finger of God has planted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in the houseless wild, to direct the traveller's journey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the sea-like, pathless, limitless waste of the desert.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such in the soul of man is faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blossoms of passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay and luxuriant flowers, are brighter and fuller of fragrance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they beguile us, and lead us astray, and their odor is deadly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this humble plant can guide us here, and hereafter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crown us with asphodel flowers, that are wet with the dews of nepenthe."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So came the autumn, and passed, and the winter,--yet Gabriel came not;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossomed the opening spring, and the notes of the robin and bluebird
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded sweet upon wold and in wood, yet Gabriel came not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter than song of bird, or hue or odor of blossom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far to the north and east, it said, in the Michigan forests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the Saginaw River,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with returning guides, that sought the lakes of St. Lawrence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying a sad farewell, Evangeline went from the Mission.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When over weary ways, by long and perilous marches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had attained at length the depths of the Michigan forests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did the long sad years glide on, and in seasons and places
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the Tents of Grace of the meek Moravian Missions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the noisy camps and the battle-fields of the army,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in secluded hamlets, in towns and populous cities.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a phantom she came, and passed away unremembered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair was she and young, when in hope began the long journey;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faded was she and old, when in disappointment it ended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving behind it, broader and deeper, the gloom and the shadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn of another life, that broke o'er her earthy horizon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware's waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn the apostle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There all the air is balm, and the peach is the emblem of beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose haunts they molested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed, an exile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There old Rene Leblanc had died; and when he departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that spake to her heart, and made her no longer a stranger;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her ear was pleased with the Thee and Thou of the Quakers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it recalled the past, the old Acadian country,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all men were equal, and all were brothers and sisters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the fruitless search, the disappointed endeavor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ended, to recommence no more upon earth, uncomplaining,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither, as leaves to the light, were turned her thoughts and her footsteps.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll away, and afar we behold the landscape below us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun-illumined, with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fell the mists from her mind, and she saw the world far below her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark no longer, but all illumined with love; and the pathway
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which she had climbed so far, lying smooth and fair in the distance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabriel was not forgotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within her heart was his image,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into her thoughts of him time entered not, for it was not.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over him years had no power; he was not changed, but transfigured;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had become to her heart as one who is dead, and not absent;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was her love diffused, but, like to some odorous spices,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffered no waste nor loss, though filling the air with aroma.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other hope had she none, nor wish in life, but to follow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekly, with reverent steps, the sacred feet of her Saviour.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy; frequenting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night after night, when the world was asleep, as the watchman repeated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud, through the gusty streets, that all was well in the city,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after day, in the gray of the dawn, as slow through the suburbs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plodded the German farmer, with flowers and fruits for the market,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met he that meek, pale face, returning home from its watchings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presaged by wondrous signs, and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkening the sun in their flight, with naught in their craws but an acorn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as the tides of the sea arise in the month of September,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding some silver stream, till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So death flooded life, and, o'erflowing its natural margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread to a brackish lake, the silver stream of existence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wealth had no power to bribe, nor beauty to charm, the oppressor;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends nor attendants,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept away to die in the almshouse, home of the homeless.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the suburbs it stood, in the midst of meadows and woodlands;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the city surrounds it; but still, with its gateway and wicket
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meek, in the midst of splendor, its humble walls seem to echo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly the words of the Lord:--"The poor ye always have with you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither, by night and by day, came the Sister of Mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed, to behold there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, on a Sabbath morn, through the streets, deserted and silent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wending her quiet way, she entered the door of the almshouse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as she mounted the stairs to the corridors, cooled by the east-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of Christ Church,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, intermingled with these, across the meadows were wafted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds of psalms, that were sung by the Swedes in their church at Wicaco.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something within her said, "At length thy trials are ended";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with light in her looks, she entered the chambers of sickness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noiselessly moved about the assiduous, careful attendants,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moistening the feverish lip, and the aching brow, and in silence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing the sightless eyes of the dead, and concealing their faces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where on their pallets they lay, like drifts of snow by the roadside.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline entered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed, for her presence
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as she looked around, she saw how Death, the consoler,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it forever.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacant their places were, or filled already by strangers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still she stood, with her colorless lips apart, while a shudder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the flowerets dropped from her fingers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the dying heard it, and started up from their pillows.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long, and thin, and gray were the locks that shaded his temples;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as he lay in the in morning light, his face for a moment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had besprinkled its portals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Angel of Death might see the sign, and pass over.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his spirit exhausted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness of slumber and death, forever sinking and sinking.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then through those realms of shade, in multiplied reverberations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard he that cry of pain, and through the hush that succeeded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and saint-like,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gabriel!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my beloved!" and died away into silence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he beheld, in a dream, once more the home of his childhood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Village, and mountain, and woodlands; and, walking under their shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the days of her youth, Evangeline rose in his vision.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he lifted his eyelids,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt by his bedside.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly he strove to whisper her name, for the accents unuttered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Died on his lips, and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline, kneeling beside him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissed his dying lips, and laid his head on her bosom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it suddenly sank into darkness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured, "Father, I thank thee!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------------

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still stands the forest primeval; but far away from its shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side, in their nameless graves, the lovers are sleeping.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the city, they lie, unknown and unnoticed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of throbbing hearts, where theirs are at rest and forever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of aching brains, where theirs no longer are busy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of toiling hands, where theirs have ceased from their labors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of weary feet, where theirs have completed their journey!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still stands the forest primeval; but under the shade of its branches
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwells another race, with other customs and language.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linger a few Acadian peasants, whose fathers from exile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline's story,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighboring ocean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.

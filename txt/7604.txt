<p> Mother, let us imagine we are travelling, and passing through a strange and dangerous country.<br> You are riding in a palanquin and I am trotting by you on a red horse.<br> It is evening and the sun goes down. The waste of Joradighi lies wan and grey before us. The land is desolate and barren.<br> You are frightened and thinking--"I know not where we have come to."<br> I say to you, "Mother, do not be afraid."<br> The meadow is prickly with spiky grass, and through it runs a narrow broken path.<br> There are no cattle to be seen in the wide field; they have gone to their village stalls.<br> It grows dark and dim on the land and sky, and we cannot tell where we are going.<br> Suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper, "What light is that near the bank?"<br> Just then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come running towards us.<br> You sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the gods in prayer.<br> The bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny bush.<br> I shout to you, "Don't be afraid, mother. I am here."<br> With long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their heads, they come nearer and nearer.<br> I shout, "Have a care! you villains! One step more and you are dead men."<br> They give another terrible yell and rush forward.<br> You clutch my hand and say, "Dear boy, for heaven's sake, keep away from them."<br> I say, "Mother, just you watch me."<br> Then I spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and buckler clash against each other.<br> The fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you a cold shudder could you see it from your palanquin.<br> Many of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces.<br> I know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your boy must be dead by this time.<br> But I come to you all stained with blood, and say, "Mother, the fight is over now."<br> You come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you say to yourself,<br> "I don't know what I should do if I hadn't my boy to escort me."<br> A thousand useless things happen day after day, and why couldn't such a thing come true by chance?<br> It would be like a story in a book.<br> My brother would say, "Is it possible? I always thought he was so delicate!"<br> Our village people would all say in amazement, "Was it not lucky that the boy was with his mother?"</p>

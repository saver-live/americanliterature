<em>An Old Sailor's Lament</em> December, 1861

I have a feeling for those ships,
  Each worn and ancient one,
With great bluff bows, and broad in the beam:
  Ay, it was unkindly done.
      But so they serve the Obsolete—
      Even so, Stone Fleet!
You'll say I'm doting; do you think
  I scudded round the Horn in one—
The <em>Tenedos</em>, a glorious
  Good old craft as ever run—
      Sunk (how all unmeet!)
      With the Old Stone Fleet.
An India ship of fame was she,
  Spices and shawls and fans she bore;
A whaler when the wrinkles came—
  Turned off! till, spent and poor,
      Her bones were sold (escheat)!
      Ah! Stone Fleet.
Four were erst patrician keels
  (Names attest what families be),
The <em>Kensington<em>!, and <em>Richmond<em>! too,
  <em>Leonidas<em>!, and <em>Lee<em>!: But now they have their seat With the Old Stone Fleet. To scuttle them—a pirate deed— Sack them, and dismast; They sunk so slow, they died so hard, But gurgling dropped at last. Their ghosts in gales repeat <em>Woe's us, Stone Fleet<em><em> And all for naught. The waters pass— Currents will have their way; Nature is nobody's ally; 'tis well; The harbor is bettered—will stay. A failure, and complete, Was your Old Stone Fleet. </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh fair enough are sky and plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I know fairer far:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are as beautiful again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in the water are;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pools and rivers wash so clean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees and clouds and air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The like on earth was never seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh that I were there.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the thoughts I often think
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stand gazing down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In act upon the cressy brink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strip and dive and drown;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the golden-sanded brooks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And azure meres I spy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silly lad that longs and looks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wishes he were I.

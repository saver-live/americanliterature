<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the moor and the mountain crest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Comrade, look not on the west - 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is down and drinks away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From air and land the lees of day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long cloud and the single pine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentinel the ending line,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out beyond it, clear and wan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach the gulfs of evening on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of woman turns his brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West from forty countries now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as the edge of heaven he eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinks eternal thoughts, and sighs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wides the world, to rest or roam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With change abroad and cheer at home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fights and furloughs, talk and tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Company and beef and ale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I front the evening sky
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent on the west look I,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my comrade, stride for stride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paces silent at my side,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comrade, look not on the west:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twill have the heart out of your breast;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twill take your thoughts and sink them far,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leagues beyond the sunset bar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh lad, I fear that yons the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they fished for you and me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, from whence we both were taen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I shall drown again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send not on your soul before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dive from that beguiling shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let not yet the swimmer leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His clothes upon the sands of eve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too fast to yonder strand forlorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We journey, to the sunken bourn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To flush the fading tinges eyed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By other lads at eventide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide is the world, to rest or roam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And early tis for turning home:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plant your heel on earth and stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lets forget our native land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you and I are split on air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long we shall be strangers there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends of flesh and bone are best;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comrade, look not on the west.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O traveller, stay thy weary feet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink of this fountain, pure and sweet;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It flows for rich and poor the same.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then go thy way, remembering still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wayside well beneath the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup of water in His name.
</pre>

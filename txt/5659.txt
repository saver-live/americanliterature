<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Build me straight, O worthy Master!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall laugh at all disaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchant's word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delighted the Master heard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his heart was in his work, and the heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giveth grace unto every Art.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quiet smile played round his lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the eddies and dimples of the tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play round the bows of ships,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That steadily at anchor ride.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a voice that was full of glee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, "Erelong we will launch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vessel as goodly, and strong, and stanch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever weathered a wintry sea!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first with nicest skill and art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect and finished in every part,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little model the Master wrought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which should be to the larger plan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the child is to the man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its counterpart in miniature;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with a hand more swift and sure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater labor might be brought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer to his inward thought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he labored, his mind ran o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various ships that were built of yore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above them all, and strangest of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose picture was hanging on the wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bows and stern raised high in air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And balconies hanging here and there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And signal lanterns and flags afloat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eight round towers, like those that frown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From some old castle, looking down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the drawbridge and the moat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said with a smile, "Our ship, I wis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be of another form than this!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was of another form, indeed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built for freight, and yet for speed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful and gallant craft;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressing down upon sail and mast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might not the sharp bows overwhelm;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad in the beam, but sloping aft
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With graceful curve and slow degrees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she might be docile to the helm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that the currents of parted seas,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing behind, with mighty force,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might aid and not impede her course.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ship-yard stood the Master,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the model of the vessel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should laugh at all disaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covering many a rood of ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the timber piled around;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scattered here and there, with these,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knarred and crooked cedar knees;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought from regions far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Pascagoula's sunny bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the banks of the roaring Roanoke!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! what a wondrous thing it is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To note how many wheels of toil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought, one word, can set in motion!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's not a ship that sails the ocean,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every climate, every soil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must bring its tribute, great or small,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And help to build the wooden wall!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun was rising o'er the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long the level shadows lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they, too, the beams would be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some great, airy argosy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Framed and launched in a single day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That silent architect, the sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had hewn and laid them every one,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the work of man was yet begun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Master, when he spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth, against an anchor leaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened, to catch his slightest meaning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the long waves, as they broke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ripples on the pebbly beach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrupted the old man's speech.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful they were, in sooth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man and the fiery youth!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man, in whose busy brain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a ship that sailed the main
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was modelled o'er and o'er again;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery youth, who was to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heir of his dexterity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had built and launched from land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the elder head had planned.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus," said he, "will we build this ship!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay square the blocks upon the slip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And follow well this plan of mine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the timbers with greatest care;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that is unsound beware;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For only what is sound and strong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to this vessel stall belong.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here together shall combine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A goodly frame, and a goodly fame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the UNION be her name!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the day that gives her to the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall give my daughter unto thee!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master's word
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enraptured the young man heard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he turned his face aside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a look of joy and a thrill of pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father's door,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the form of his promised bride.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shone on her golden hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the breath of morn and the soft sea air.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a beauteous barge was she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still at rest on the sandy beach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just beyond the billow's reach;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the restless, seething, stormy sea!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, how skilful grows the hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That obeyeth Love's command!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the heart, and not the brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to the highest doth attain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he who followeth Love's behest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far excelleth all the rest!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus with the rising of the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the noble task begun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were heard the intermingled sounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of axes and of mallets, plied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With vigorous arms on every side;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plied so deftly and so well,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, ere the shadows of evening fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keel of oak for a noble ship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was lying ready, and stretched along
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blocks, well placed upon the slip.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy, thrice happy, every one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sees his labor well begun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not perplexed and multiplied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By idly waiting for time and tide!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the hot, long day was o'er,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man at the Master's door
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat with the maiden calm and still.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And within the porch, a little more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removed beyond the evening chill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father sat, and told them tales
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wrecks in the great September gales,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pirates coasting the Spanish Main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ships that never came back again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chance and change of a sailor's life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want and plenty, rest and strife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His roving fancy, like the wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nothing can stay and nothing can bind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magic charm of foreign lands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With shadows of palms, and shining sands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the tumbling surf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he lies alone and asleep on the turf.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trembling maiden held her breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its terror and mystery,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That divides and yet unites mankind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whenever the old man paused, a gleam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent group in the twilight gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thoughtful faces, as in a dream;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for a moment one might mark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What had been hidden by the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the head of the maiden lay at rest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenderly, on the young man's breast!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day the vessel grew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With timbers fashioned strong and true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, framed with perfect symmetry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skeleton ship rose up to view!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around the bows and along the side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy hammers and mallets plied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till after many a week, at length,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful for form and strength,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublime in its enormous bulk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around it columns of smoke, up-wreathing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caldron, that glowed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And overflowed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the black tar, heated for the sheathing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amid the clamors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of clattering hammers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who listened heard now and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song of the Master and his men:--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Build me straight, O worthy Master.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall laugh at all disaster,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With oaken brace and copper band,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the rudder on the sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, like a thought, should have control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the movement of the whole;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And near it the anchor, whose giant hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would reach down and grapple with the land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And immovable and fast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the bows an image stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a cunning artist carved in wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With robes of white, that far behind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to be fluttering in the wind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not shaped in a classic mould,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Naiad rising from the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But modelled from the Master's daughter!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On many a dreary and misty night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T will be seen by the rays of the signal light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speeding along through the rain and the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a ghost in its snow-white sark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pilot of some phantom bark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guiding the vessel, in its flight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a path none other knows aright!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, at last,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tall and tapering mast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is swung into its place;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrouds and stays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding it firm and fast!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deer-haunted forests of Maine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When upon mountain and plain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay the snow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fell,--those lordly pines!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those grand, majestic pines!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid shouts and cheers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jaded steers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panting beneath the goad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragged down the weary, winding road
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those captive kings so straight and tall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be shorn of their streaming hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, naked and bare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel the stress and the strain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wind and the reeling main,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose roar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would remind them forevermore
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their native forests they should not see again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everywhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender, graceful spars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poise aloft in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the mast-head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White, blue, and red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flag unrolls the stripes and stars.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In foreign harbors shall behold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flag unrolled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T will be as a friendly hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched out from his native land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling his heart with memories sweet and endless!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is finished! and at length
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has come the bridal day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beauty and of strength.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day the vessel shall be launched!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o'er the bay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, in all his splendors dight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sun rises to behold the sight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centuries old,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paces restless to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and down the sands of gold.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beating heart is not at rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far and wide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ceaseless flow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beard of snow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaves with the heaving of his breast.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waits impatient for his bride.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There she stands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her foot upon the sands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decked with flags and streamers gay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In honor of her marriage day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round her like a veil descending,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride of the gray old sea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the deck another bride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is standing by her lover's side.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows from the flags and shrouds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the shadows cast by clouds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken by many a sunny fleck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall around them on the deck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayer is said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joyous bridegroom bows his head;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in tear's the good old Master
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes the brown hand of his son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, for he cannot speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever faster
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down his own the tears begin to run.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worthy pastor--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shepherd of that wandering flock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has the ocean for its wold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has the vessel for its fold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaping ever from rock to rock--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake, with accents mild and clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words of warning, words of cheer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tedious to the bridegroom's ear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew the chart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sailor's heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its pleasures and its griefs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All its shallows and rocky reefs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those secret currents, that flow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such resistless undertow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lift and drift, with terrible force,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will from its moorings and its course.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore he spake, and thus said he:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like unto ships far off at sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outward or homeward bound, are we.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, behind, and all around,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floats and swings the horizon's bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems at its distant rim to rise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And climb the crystal wall of the skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again to turn and sink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if we could slide from its outer brink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! it is not the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the sea that sinks and shelves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ourselves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rock and rise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With endless and uneasy motion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now touching the very skies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now sinking into the depths of ocean.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! if our souls but poise and swing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the compass in its brazen ring,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever level and ever true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the toil and the task we have to do,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall sail securely, and safely reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining beach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sights we see, and the sounds we hear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be those of joy and not of fear!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Master,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gesture of command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waved his hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud and sudden there was heard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around them and below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of hammers, blow on blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocking away the shores and spurs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see! she stirs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She starts,--she moves,--she seems to feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrill of life along her keel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, spurning with her foot the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one exulting, joyous bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaps into the ocean's arms!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! from the assembled crowd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There rose a shout, prolonged and loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to the ocean seemed to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take her, O bridegroom, old and gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take her to thy protecting arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all her youth and all her charms!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beautiful she is!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lies within those arms, that press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her form with many a soft caress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of tenderness and watchful care!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail forth into the sea, O ship!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through wind and wave, right onward steer!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moistened eye, the trembling lip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not the signs of doubt or fear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail forth into the sea of life,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O gentle, loving, trusting wife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And safe from all adversity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the bosom of that sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy comings and thy goings be!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For gentleness and love and trust
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevail o'er angry wave and gust;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the wreck of noble lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something immortal still survives!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail on, O UNION, strong and great!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity with all its fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the hopes of future years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know what Master laid thy keel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What anvils rang, what hammers beat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what a forge and what a heat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear not each sudden sound and shock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is of the wave and not the rock;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is but the flapping of the sail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a rent made by the gale!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of rock and tempest's roar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of false lights on the shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are all with thee,--are all with thee!

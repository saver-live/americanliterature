<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! I must tell a tale of chivalry;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For large white plumes are dancing in mine eye.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not like the formal crest of latter days:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But bending in a thousand graceful ways;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So graceful, that it seems no mortal hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or een the touch of Archimagos wand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could charm them into such an attitude.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must think rather, that in playful mood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show this wonder of its gentle might.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! I must tell a tale of chivalry;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For while I muse, the lance points slantingly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athwart the morning air: some lady sweet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the worn top of some old battlement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hails it with tears, her stout defender sent:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from her own pure self no joy dissembling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, when the good Knight his rest would take,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reflected, clearly, in a lake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the young ashen boughs, gainst which it rests,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And th half seen mossiness of linnets nests.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! shall I ever tell its cruelty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fire flashes from a warriors eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his tremendous hand is grasping it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his dark brow for very wrath is knit?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or when his spirit, with more calm intent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaps to the honors of a tournament,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes the gazers round about the ring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stare at the grandeur of the ballancing?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no! this is far off: then how shall I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which linger yet about lone gothic arches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dark green ivy, and among wild larches?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sing the splendour of the revelries,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When but[t]s of wine are drunk off to the lees?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that bright lance, against the fretted wall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the shade of stately banneral,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is slung with shining cuirass, sword, and shield?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where ye may see a spur in bloody field.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light-footed damsels move with gentle paces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the wide hall, and show their happy faces;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet must I tell a tale of chivalry:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rein in the swelling of his ample might?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spenser! thy brows are arched, open, kind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And come like a clear sun-rise to my mind;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And always does my heart with pleasure dance,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think on thy noble countenance:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where never yet was ought more earthly seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the pure freshness of thy laurels green.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, great bard, I not so fearfully
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call on thy gentle spirit to hover nigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My daring steps: or if thy tender care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus startled unaware,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be jealous that the foot of other wight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should madly follow that bright path of light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracd by thy lovd Libertas; he will speak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell thee that my prayer is very meek;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I will follow with due reverence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And start with awe at mine own strange pretence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him thou wilt hear; so I will rest in hope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see wide plains, fair trees and lawny slope:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morn, the eve, the light, the shade, the flowers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear streams, smooth lakes, and overlooking towers.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lad for longing sighs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mute and dull of cheer and pale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at death's own door he lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maiden, you can heal his ail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovers' ills are all to buy:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wan look, the hollow tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hung head, the sunken eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can have them for your own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy them, buy them: eve and morn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovers' ills are all to sell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you can lie down forlorn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lover will be well.

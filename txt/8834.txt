<p>AT that lost hour disowned of day and night,<br> The after-birth of midnight, when life's face<br> Turns to the wall and the last lamp goes out<br> Before the incipient irony of dawn --<br> In that obliterate interval of time<br> Between the oil's last flicker and the first<br> Reluctant shudder of averted day,<br> Threading the city's streets (like mine own ghost<br> Wakening the echoes of dispeopled dreams),<br> I smiled to see how the last light that fought<br> Extinction was the old familiar glare<br> Of supper tables under gas-lit ceilings,<br> The same old stale monotonous carouse<br> Of greed and surfeit nodding face to face<br> O'er the picked bones of pleasure . . .<br> So that the city seemed, at that waste hour,<br> Like some expiring planet from whose face<br> All nobler life had perished -- love and hate,<br> And labor and the ecstasy of thought --<br> Leaving the eyeless creatures of the ooze,<br> Dull offspring of its first inchoate birth,<br> The last to cling to its exhausted breast.<br> <br> And threading thus the aimless streets that strayed<br> Conjectural through a labyrinth of death,<br> Strangely I came upon two hooded nuns,<br> Hands in their sleeves, heads bent as if beneath<br> Some weight of benediction, gliding by<br> Punctual as shadows that perform their round<br> Upon the inveterate bidding of the sun<br> Again and yet again their ordered course<br> At the same hour crossed mine: obedient shades<br> Cast by some high-orbed pity on the waste<br> Of midnight evil! and my wondering thoughts<br> Tracked them from the hushed convent where there kin<br> Lay hived in sweetness of their prayer built cells.<br> What wind of fate had loosed them from the lee<br> Of that dear anchorage where their sisters slept?<br> On what emprise of heavenly piracy<br> Did such frail craft put forth upon this world;<br> In what incalculable currents caught<br> And swept beyond the signal-lights of home<br> Did their white coifs set sail against the night?<br> <br> At last, upon my wonder drawn, I followed<br> The secret wanderers till I saw them pause<br> Before the dying glare of those tall panes<br> Where greed and surfeit nodded face to face<br> O'er the picked bones of pleasure . . .<br> And the door opened and the nuns went in.<br> <br> Again I met them, followed them again.<br> Straight as a thought of mercy to its goal<br> To the same door they sped. I stood alone.<br> And suddenly the silent city shook<br> With inarticulate clamor of gagged lips,<br> As in Jerusalem when the veil was rent<br> And the dead drove the living from the streets.<br> And all about me stalked the shrouded dead,<br> Dead hopes, dead efforts, loves and sorrows dead,<br> With empty orbits groping for their dead<br> In that blind mustering of murdered faiths . . .<br> And the door opened and the nuns came out.<br> <br> I turned and followed. Once again we came<br> To such a threshold, such a door received them,<br> They vanished, and I waited. The grim round<br> Ceased only when the festal panes grew dark<br> And the last door had shot its tardy bolt.<br> "Too late!" I heard one murmur; and "Too late!"<br> The other, in unholy antiphon.<br> And with dejected steps they turned away.<br> <br> They turned, and still I tracked them, till they bent<br> Under the lee of a calm convent wall<br> Bounding a quiet street. I knew the street,<br> One of those village byways strangely trapped<br> In the city's meshes, where at loudest noon<br> The silence spreads like moss beneath the foot,<br> And all the tumult of the town becomes<br> Idle as Ocean's fury in a shell.<br> <br> Silent at noon -- but now, at this void hour,<br> When the blank sky hung over the blank streets<br> Clear as a mirror held above dead lips,<br> Came footfalls, and a thronging of dim shapes<br> About the convent door: a suppliant line<br> Of pallid figures, ghosts of happier folk,<br> Moving in some gray underworld of want<br> On which the sun of plenty never dawns.<br> And as the nuns approached I saw the throng<br> Pale emanation of that outcast hour,<br> Divide like vapor when the sun breaks through<br> And take the glory on its tattered edge.<br> For so a brightness ran from face to face,<br> Faint as a diver's light beneath the sea<br> And as a wave draws up the beach, the crowd<br> Drew to the nuns.<br> I waited. Then those two<br> Strange pilgrims of the sanctuaries of sin<br> Brought from beneath their large conniving cloaks<br> Two hidden baskets brimming with rich store<br> Of broken viands -- pasties, jellies, meats,<br> Crumbs of Belshazzar's table, evil waste<br> Of that interminable nightly feast<br> Of greed and surfeit, nodding face to face<br> O'er the picked bones of pleasure . . .<br> And piteous hands were stretched to take the bread<br> Of this strange sacrament -- this manna brought<br> Out of the antique wilderness of sin.<br> <br> Each seized a portion, turning comforted<br> From this new breaking of the elements;<br> And while I watched the mystery of renewal<br> Whereby the dead bones of old sins become<br> The living body of the love of God,<br> It seemed to me that a like change transformed<br> The city's self . . . a little wandering air<br> Ruffled the ivy on the convent wall;<br> A bird piped doubtfully; the dawn replied;<br> And in that ancient gray necropolis<br> Somewhere a child awoke and took the breast.</p>

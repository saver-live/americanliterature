<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley of the Pegnitz, where across broad meadow-lands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise the blue Franconian mountains, Nuremberg, the ancient, stands.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quaint old town of toil and traffic, quaint old town of art and song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memories haunt thy pointed gables, like the rooks that round them throng:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memories of the Middle Ages, when the emperors, rough and bold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had their dwelling in thy castle, time-defying, centuries old;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy brave and thrifty burghers boasted, in their uncouth rhyme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That their great imperial city stretched its hand through every clime.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the court-yard of the castle, bound with many an iron hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands the mighty linden planted by Queen Cunigunde's hand;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the square the oriel window, where in old heroic days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat the poet Melchior singing Kaiser Maximilian's praise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere I see around me rise the wondrous world of Art:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fountains wrought with richest sculpture standing in the common mart;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above cathedral doorways saints and bishops carved in stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a former age commissioned as apostles to our own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church of sainted Sebald sleeps enshrined his holy dust,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in bronze the Twelve Apostles guard from age to age their trust;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church of sainted Lawrence stands a pix of sculpture rare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the foamy sheaf of fountains, rising through the painted air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, when Art was still religion, with a simple, reverent heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived and labored Albrecht Durer, the Evangelist of Art;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence in silence and in sorrow, toiling still with busy hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an emigrant he wandered, seeking for the Better Land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emigravit is the inscription on the tombstone where he lies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead he is not, but departed,--for the artist never dies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairer seems the ancient city, and the sunshine seems more fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he once has trod its pavement, that he once has breathed its air!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these streets so broad and stately, these obscure and dismal lanes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked of yore the Mastersingers, chanting rude poetic strains.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From remote and sunless suburbs came they to the friendly guild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building nests in Fame's great temple, as in spouts the swallows build.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the weaver plied the shuttle, wove he too the mystic rhyme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the smith his iron measures hammered to the anvil's chime;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanking God, whose boundless wisdom makes the flowers of poesy bloom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forge's dust and cinders, in the tissues of the loom.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Hans Sachs, the cobbler-poet, laureate of the gentle craft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisest of the Twelve Wise Masters, in huge folios sang and laughed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his house is now an ale-house, with a nicely sanded floor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a garland in the window, and his face above the door;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted by some humble artist, as in Adam Puschman's song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the old man gray and dove-like, with his great beard white and long.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at night the swart mechanic comes to drown his cark and care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quaffing ale from pewter tankard; in the master's antique chair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished is the ancient splendor, and before my dreamy eye
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wave these mingled shapes and figures, like a faded tapestry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not thy Councils, not thy Kaisers, win for thee the world's regard;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thy painter, Albrecht Durer, and Hans Sachs thy cobbler-bard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, O Nuremberg, a wanderer from a region far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he paced thy streets and court-yards, sang in thought his careless lay:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering from the pavement's crevice, as a floweret of the soil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility of labor,--the long pedigree of toil.

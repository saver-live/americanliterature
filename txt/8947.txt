 'TWAS mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
  Taught my benighted soul to understand
  That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too:
  Once I redemption neither fought nor knew,
  Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
  "Their colour is a diabolic die."
  Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,
  May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.

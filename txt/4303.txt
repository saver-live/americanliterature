<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother belov'd if health shall smile again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon this wasted form and fever'd cheek:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If e'er returning vigour bid these weak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And languid limbs their gladsome strength regain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well may thy brow the placid glow retain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sweet content and thy pleas'd eye may speak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conscious self applause, but should I seek
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To utter what this heart can feel, Ah! vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the attempt! Yet kindest friends while o'er
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My couch ye bend, and watch with tenderness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The being whom your cares could e'en restore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cold grasp of Death, say can you guess
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feelings which these lips can ne'er express;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feelings, deep fix'd in grateful memory's store.
</pre>

<p><br> There was wine in a cup of gold<br> and a girl of fifteen from Wu,<br> her eyebrows painted dark<br> and with slippers of red brocade.<br> <br> If her conversation was poor,<br> how beautifully she could sing!<br> Together we dined and drank<br> until she settled in my arms.<br> <br> Behind her curtains<br> embroidered with lotuses,<br> how could I refuse<br> the temptation of her advances?<br></p>

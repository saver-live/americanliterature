<pre>Upon one wild and windy night--
Woo-oo, woo-oo, Woo-oo, woo-oo--
We, Jacks, our lanters all did light--
The Wind-- it surely knew-- FOR--

Whistle and whistle-- and whist! Now, list!
Woo-oo, woo-oo, Woo-oo, woo-oo--
Whirling and twirling, with turn and twist,
The wind-- it softly blew.

It was the creepiest, scariest night--
Woo-oo, woo-oo, Woo-oo, woo-oo--
We held our breath, then lost it quite,
The wind-- it surely knew-- FOR--

Whistle and whistle-- and whist! Now, list!
Woo-oo, woo-oo, Woo-oo, woo-oo--
Whirling and twirling, with turn and twist,
The wind-- it loudly blew.

It rose in all its main and might,
Woo-oo, woo-oo, Woo-oo, woo-oo--
It blew out every single light!
The wind-- it surely knew--OH--

Whistle and whistle-- and whist! Now, list!
Woo-oo, woo-oo, Woo-oo, woo-oo--
Whirling and twirling, with turn and twist,
That wind-- it laughed "Ho oh!"

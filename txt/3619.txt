<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As through the wild green hills of Wyre
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train ran, changing sky and shire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far behind, a fading crest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low in the forsaken west
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank the high-reared head of Clee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hand lay empty on my knee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aching on my knee it lay:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That morning half a shire away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many an honest fellow's fist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand, said I, since now we part
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From fields and men we know by heart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From strangers' faces, strangers' lands,-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand, you have held true fellows' hands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be clean then; rot before you do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing they'd not believe of you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I must keep from shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In London streets the Shropshire name;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On banks of Thames they must not say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severn breeds worse men than they;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And friends abroad must bear in mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends at home they leave behind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I shall be stiff and cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I forget you, hearts of gold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land where I shall mind you not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the land where all's forgot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if my foot returns no more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luck, my lads, be with you still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By falling stream and standing hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By chiming tower and whispering tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men that made a man of me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About your work in town and farm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still you'll keep my head from harm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still you'll help me, hands that gave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grasp to friend me to the grave.

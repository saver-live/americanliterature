<p> Under the wide and starry sky,<br> Dig the grave and let me lie.<br> Glad did I live and gladly die,<br> And I laid me down with a will.<br></p>
<br>
<p></p>
<i>Here he lies where he longed to be;<br></i>
<i>Home is the sailor, home from sea,<br></i>
<p></p>
<i>And the hunter home from the hill.</i>

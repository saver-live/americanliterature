&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orchards half the way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From home to Ludlow fair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowered on the first of May
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mays when I was there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seen from stile or turning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plume of smoke would show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where fires were burning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That went out long ago.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plum broke forth in green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pear stood high and snowed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends and I between
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would take the Ludlow road;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed to the nines and drinking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And light in heart and limb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each chap thinking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair was held for him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the trees in flower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New friends at fairtime tread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way where Ludlow tower
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands planted on the dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our thoughts, a long while after,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think, our words they say;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs nowÂ’'s the laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair, the first of May.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, yonder lads are yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fools that we were then;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For oh, the sons we get
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are still the sons of men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sumless tale of sorrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is all unrolled in vain:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May comes to-morrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ludlow fair again.

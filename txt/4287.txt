<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This living hand, now warm and capable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the icy silence of the tomb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou wouldst wish thine own heart dry of blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in my veins red life might stream again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou be conscience-calmed, see here it is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold it towards you.
</pre>

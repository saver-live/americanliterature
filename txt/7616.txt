<p> Why do you sit there on the floor so quiet and silent, tell me, mother dear?<br> The rain is coming in through the open window, making you all wet, and you don't mind it.<br> Do you hear the gong striking four? It is time for my brother to come home from school.<br> What has happened to you that you look so strange?<br> Haven't you got a letter from father to-day?<br> I saw the postman bringing letters in his bag for almost everybody in the town.<br> Only, father's letters he keeps to read himself. I am sure the postman is a wicked man.<br> But don't be unhappy about that, mother dear.<br> To-morrow is market day in the next village. You ask your maid to buy some pens and papers.<br> I myself will write all father's letters; you will not find a single mistake.<br> I shall write from A right up to K.<br> But, mother, why do you smile?<br> You don't believe that I can write as nicely as father does!<br> But I shall rule my paper carefully, and write all the letters beautifully big.<br> When I finish my writing, do you think I shall be so foolish as father and drop it into the horrid postman's bag?<br> I shall bring it to you myself without waiting, and letter by letter help you to read my writing.<br> I know the postman does not like to give you the really nice letters.</p>

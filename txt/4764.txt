<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My girl she give me the go onest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a London lad;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An I went on the drink for a fortnight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An then I went to the bad.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen she give me a shillin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight for er over the seas;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Guvment built me a fever-trap,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Injia give me disease.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Chorus) Ho! dont you eed what a girl says,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An dont you go for the beer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was an ass when I was at grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An that is why Im ere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fired a shot at a Afghan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggar e fired again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An I lay on my bed with a ole in my ed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An missed the next campaign!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I up with my gun at a Burman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who carried a bloomin dah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cartridge stuck and the baynit bruk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An all I got was the scar.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Chorus) Ho! dont you aim at a Afghan,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you stand on the skyline clear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An dont you go for a Burman
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If none o your friends is near.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served my time for a Corpral,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An wetted my stripes with pop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I went on the bend with a intimate friend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An finished the night in the shop.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served my time for a Sergeant;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonel e sez No!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most youll see is a full C.B.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An . . . very next night twas so!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Chorus) Ho! dont you go for a Corpral
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless your ed is clear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was an ass when I was at grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An that is why Im ere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive tasted the luck o the Army
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In barrack an camp an clink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An I lost my tip through the bloomin trip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along o the women an drink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im down at the heel o my service,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An when I am laid on the shelf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My very worst friend from beginning to end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the blood of a mouse was myself!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Chorus) Ho! dont you eed what a girl says,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An dont you go for the beer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was an ass when I was at grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An that is why Im ere!

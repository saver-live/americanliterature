<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O! were I one of the Olympian twelve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their godships should pass this into law,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That when a man doth set himself in toil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some beauty veiled far away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each step he took should make his lady's hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More soft, more white, and her fair cheek more fair;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for each briar-berry he might eat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kiss should bud upon the tree of love,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pulp and ripen richer every hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To melt away upon the traveller's lips.

1.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun, with his great eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees not so much as I;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moon, all silve-proud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might as well be in a cloud.

2.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And O the spring the spring!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lead the life of a king!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couch'd in the teeming grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spy each pretty lass.

3.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look where no one dares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I stare where no one stares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the night is nigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lambs bleat my lullaby.

Folly's Song.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wedding fiddles are a-playing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when maidens go a-Maying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a milk-pail is upset,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the clothes left in the wet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the barrel's set abroach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kate Eyebrow keeps a coach,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pig is over-roasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cheese is over-toasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sir Snap is with his lawyer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Miss Chap has kiss'd the sawyer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huzza for folly O!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I am frighten'd with most hateful thoughts!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps her voice is not a nightingale's,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps her teeth are not the fairest pearl;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eye-lashes may be, for aught I know,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not longer than the May-fly's small fan-horns;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may not be one dimple on her hand;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And freckles many; ah! a careless nurse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In haste to teach the little thing to walk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May have crumpt up a pair of Dian's legs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And warpt the ivory of a Juno's neck.

Song.

1.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger lighted from his steed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ere he spake a word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seiz'd my lady's lily hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kiss'd it all unheard.

2.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger walk'd into the hall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ere he spake a word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kiss'd my lady's cherry lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kiss'd 'em all unheard.

3.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger walk'd into the bower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my lady first did go,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye hand in hand into the bower,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where my lord's roses blow.

4.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lady's maid had a silken scarf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a golden ring had she,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a kiss from the stranger, as off he went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on his fair palfrey.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asleep! O sleep a little while, white pearl!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me kneel, and let me pray to thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me call HeavenÂ’s blessing on thine eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me breathe into the happy air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doth enfold and touch thee all about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vows of my slavery, my giving up,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sudden adoration, my great love!

<p><cite class="al-title">Peter Pan</cite> is a little boy who never ages and never grows up, first introduced in 1902, in a novel by James Barrie. The character debuted to larger acclaim in a 1904 play, <cite class="al-title"> Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</cite>. That play was expanded and published as a novel in 1911 where the title changed three times with future editions: <cite class="al-title">Peter and Wendy</cite>, then <cite class="al-title">Peter Pan and Wendy</cite>, and finally the title that stuck, <cite class="al-title">Peter Pan</cite>. The Disney film provided wonderful enduring characters to remember. Our favorite was the protective dog, Nana, the Newfoundland.

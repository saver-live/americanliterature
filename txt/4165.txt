<p> A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: <br> Its lovliness increases; it will never <br> Pass into nothingness; but still will keep <br> A bower quiet for us, and a sleep <br> Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. <br> Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing <br> A flowery band to bind us to the earth, <br> Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth <br> Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, <br> Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways <br> Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, <br> Some shape of beauty moves away the pall <br> From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, <br> Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon <br> For simple sheep; and such are daffodils <br> With the green world they live in; and clear rills <br> That for themselves a cooling covert make <br> 'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake, <br> Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: <br> And such too is the grandeur of the dooms <br> We have imagined for the mighty dead; <br> An endless fountain of immortal drink, <br> Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. <br> </p>

<p>Because somewhere there's simplicity and light,<br> Transparent, warm and joyous…<br> There a neighbour talks with a girl at twilight,<br> Over the fence, and only the bees hear,<br> The most tender of murmurings.<br> <br> While we live with ceremony, difficulty,<br> Honouring the rites of our bitter meetings,<br> Where a sudden reckless gust<br> Breaks off the sentence begun –<br> <br> But we'd not exchange for anything<br> This granite city of fame and misfortune,<br> The wide rivers of shining ice,<br> The sunless, gloomy gardens,<br> The barely audible voice of the Muse.<br></p>

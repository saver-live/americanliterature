<p>Once referenced as "Maybe the best [horror story] in the English language" by American author Stephen King, Machen's novella, <cite class="al-title">The Great God Pan</cite> (written in 1890, revised 1894) is a horror story classic. The story was also highly praised by H.P. Lovecraft.</p><p>When published, the novella was denounced for both its style and content; deemed by critics as too decadent and sexual. Machen takes the title from an 1862 poem <cite class="al-title"><a href="/author/elizabeth-barrett-browning/poem/a-musical-instrument">A Musical Instrument</a></cite> by <a href="/author/elizabeth-barrett-browning/bio-books-stories">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>. The first line of every stanza in the poem ends: "<i>. . . the great god Pan</i>." At the time of publication, Pan was popularly referenced in literature as a symbol of nature and paganism.</p><p>In the story, Dr Raymond wishes to experience all that the world has to offer -- this is what he means by "seeing the great god Pan." After studying the human mind, he performs brain surgery on a young woman but the surgery goes awry. It's such a fantastic story that I wish to provide no other details lest I risk spoiling the story.</p><p>The book is featured in our collection of <a href="/halloween">Halloween Stories</a>.

The tomb asked of the rose:
﻿"What dost thou with the tears, which dawn
﻿Sheds on thee every summer morn,
Thou sweetest flower that blows?"
The rose asked of the tomb:
﻿"What dost thou with the treasures rare,
﻿Thou hidest deep from light and air,
Until the day of doom?"

The rose said: "Home of night,
﻿Deep in my bosom, I distil
﻿Those pearly tears to scents, that fill
The senses with delight."
The tomb said: "Flower of love,
﻿I make of every treasure rare,
﻿Hidden so deep from light and air,
A soul for heaven above!"

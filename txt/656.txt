<p>To drown the ancient sorrows,<br> we drank a hundred jugs of wine<br> there in the beautiful night.<br> We couldn't go to bed with the moon so bright.<br> <br> The finally the wine overcame us<br> and we lay down on the empty mountain--<br> the earth for a pillow,<br> and a blanket made of heaven.<br> <br></p>

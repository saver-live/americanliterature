<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me your patience, sister, while I frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exact in capitals your golden name;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sue the fair Apollo and he will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rouse from his heavy slumber and instill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great love in me for thee and Poesy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine not that greatest mastery
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kingdom over all the Realms of verse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nears more to heaven in aught, than when we nurse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And surety give to love and Brotherhood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthropophagi in Othello's mood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysses storm'd and his enchanted belt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glow with the Muse, but they are never felt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbosom'd so and so eternal made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such tender incense in their laurel shade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the regent sisters of the Nine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this poor offering to you, sister mine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind sister! aye, this third name says you are;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enchanted has it been the Lord knows where;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And may it taste to you like good old wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take you to real happiness and give
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sons, daughters and a home like honied hive.
</pre>

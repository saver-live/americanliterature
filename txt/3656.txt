<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I was in love with you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I was clean and brave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And miles around the wonder grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How well did I behave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the fancy passes by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing will remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And miles around they'll say that I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am quite myself again.

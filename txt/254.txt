<p>My heart beats smoothly, steadily,<br> What are long years to me?<br> Under the Galernaya arch,<br> Our shadows, for eternity.<br> <br> Through half-closed eyelids,<br> I see, I see that you're with me,<br> And forever held in your hand<br> Is my unopened fan.<br> <br> Because we stood together,<br> In that blessed miraculous moment,<br> The instant of the rose-red moon<br> Lifting over the Summer Garden –<br> <br> I've no need to wait<br> At some hateful window,<br> Or grow weary with meeting –<br> My thirsty love is quenched.<br> <br> You are free, and so am I,<br> Tomorrow will be better than yesterday –<br> Above the Neva's dark waters,<br> Below the Emperor Peter's<br> Cold smile.<br></p>

<p>To lose the freshness of speech, the simplicity of feeling,<br> Isn't that, for us, like a painter losing the power of sight,<br> Or an actor, their voice and movement,<br> Or a lovely woman, her beauty?<br> <br> But don't try to keep to yourself<br> This gift the heavens have granted:<br> We're condemned – you know it yourself –<br> To squander, not hoard, its wealth.<br> <br> Go alone, and heal the blind,<br> To know, in the heavy hours of doubt,<br> The mockery of gloating followers,<br> The indifference of the crowd.<br></p>

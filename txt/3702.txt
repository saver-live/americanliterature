<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night my father got me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind was not on me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not plague his fancy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To muse if I should be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son you see.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day my mother bore me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a fool and glad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the pain I cost her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she had borne the lad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That borne she had.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother and my father
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the light they lie;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrant would not find them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here Â‘tis only I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall hang so high.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh let not man remember
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul that God forgot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fetch the county kerchief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And noose me in the knot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will rot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so the game is ended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should not have begun.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father and my mother
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had a likely son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have none.

<p>You should appear less often in my dreams,<br> Since we meet so frequently;<br> Yet only in night's sanctuary<br> Are you sad, troubled, and tender.<br> And sweeter than seraphic praise<br> Is your lips' dear flatteryâ€¦<br> Ah, in dreams you won't mistake my name,<br> Or gently sigh, as you do here.<br></p>

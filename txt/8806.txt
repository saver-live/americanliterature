<p>I MEANT to be so strong and true!<br> The world may smile and question, When?<br> But what I might have been to you<br> I cannot be to other men.<br> Just one in twenty to the rest,<br> And all in all to you alone, --<br> This was my dream; perchance 'tis best<br> That this, like other dreams, is flown.<br> &nbsp;<br> <br> For you I should have been so kind,<br> So prompt my spirit to control,<br> To win fresh vigor for my mind,<br> And purer beauties for my soul;<br> Beneath your eye I might have grown<br> To that divine, ideal height,<br> Which, mating wholly with your own,<br> Our equal spirits should unite.<br> <br> To others I am less than naught;<br> To you I might have been so much,<br> Could but your calm, discerning thought<br> Have put my powers to the touch!<br> Your love had made me doubly fair;<br> Your wisdom made me thrice as wise,<br> Lent clearer lustre to my hair,<br> And read new meanings in my eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> <br> Ah, yes, to you I might have been<br> That happy being, past recall,<br> The slave, the helpmeet, and the queen, --<br> All these in one, and one in all.<br> But that which I had dreamed to do<br> I learned too late was dreamed in vain,<br> For what I might have been to you<br> I cannot be to other men.</p>

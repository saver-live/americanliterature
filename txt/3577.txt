<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh see how thick the goldcup flowers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are lying in field and lane,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dandelions to tell the hours
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never are told again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh may I squire you round the meads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pick you posies gay?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-'Twill do no harm to take my arm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may, young man, you may."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, spring was sent for lass and lad,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis now the blood runs gold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And man and maid had best be glad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the world is old.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What flowers to-day may flower to-morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never as good as new.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Suppose I wound my arm right round-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Tis true, young man, 'tis true."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some lads there are, 'tis shame to say,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That only court to thieve,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once they bear the bloom away
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis little enough they leave.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then keep your heart for men like me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And safe from trustless chaps.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love is true and all for you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps, young man, perhaps."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, look in my eyes, then, can you doubt?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Why, 'tis a mile from town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How green the grass is all about!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might as well sit down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Ah, life, what is it but a flower?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must true lovers sigh?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be kind, have pity, my own, my pretty,-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good-bye, young man, good-bye."

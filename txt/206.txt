<p>White churches there, and bright crackling ice,<br> There my son's cornflower-blue eyes blossom.<br> Above the old town, nights are diamond-bright, Russian:<br> More yellow than lime-flower honey, the moon's slice.<br> Dry snow-storms blow from the plains beyond the river,<br> And, like angels, men are glad on God's Holy Day.<br> They've cleared the best room, icon lamps play,<br> On the oak table you'll see the Good Book's cover.<br> There, ungenerous to me now, Memory so severe,<br> Bowed low, opened her tower rooms as well;<br> But I slammed the fearful door, did not enter:<br> While the town rang with cheerful Christmas bells.<br> <br> Note: Bezhetsk is about 140 miles north of Moscow in the Tverskaya<br> Oblast Region. The poem is dated 26th December 1921.<br></p>

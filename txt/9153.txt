<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I, from that reed-throated whisperer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who comes at need, although not now as once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear articulation in the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But inwardly, surmise companions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the fling of the dull asss hoof,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Jonsons phrase, and find when June is come
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Kyle-na-no under that ancient roof
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sterner conscience and a friendlier home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can forgive even that wrong of wrongs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those undreamt accidents that have made me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Fame has perished this long while
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being but a part of ancient ceremony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notorious, till all my priceless things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are but a post the passing dogs defile.

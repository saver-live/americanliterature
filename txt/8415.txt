<p>John Wagner, the oldest man in Buffalo--one hundred and four years old --recently walked a mile and a half in two weeks. </p><p>He is as cheerful and bright as any of these other old men that charge around so persistently and tiresomely in the newspapers, and in every way as remarkable. </p><p>Last November he walked five blocks in a rainstorm, without any shelter but an umbrella, and cast his vote for Grant, remarking that he had voted for forty-seven presidents--which was a lie. </p><p>His "second crop" of rich brown hair arrived from New York yesterday, and he has a new set of teeth coming from Philadelphia. </p><p>He is to be married next week to a girl one hundred and two years old, who still takes in washing. </p><p>They have been engaged eighty years, but their parents persistently refused their consent until three days ago. </p><p>John Wagner is two years older than the Rhode Island veteran, and yet has never tasted a drop of liquor in his life--unless-unless you count whisky. <br><br> </p><p></p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

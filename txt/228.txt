<p>I came here, in idleness.<br> Where I'm bored: all the same to me!<br> A sleepy hilltop mill, yes,<br> Here years pass silently.<br> <br> Over convolvulus gone dry<br> The bee swims past, ahead,<br> I call to that mermaid by<br> The pond: the mermaid's dead.<br> <br> Thick with mud, and rusted,<br> The wide pond's shallows:<br> Over the trembling aspen<br> A weightless moon glows.<br> <br> Isee everything freshly.<br> The poplars smell moist.<br> I'm silent. Silent, ready<br> To be yours again, earth.<br></p>

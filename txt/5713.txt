<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the village churchyard she lies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust is in her beautiful eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more she breathes, nor feels, nor stirs;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At her feet and at her head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies a slave to attend the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their dust is white as hers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was she a lady of high degree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much in love with the vanity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And foolish pomp of this world of ours?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or was it Christian charity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lowliness and humility,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The richest and rarest of all dowers?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall tell us?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one speaks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No color shoots into those cheeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either of anger or of pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the rude question we have asked;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor will the mystery be unmasked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By those who are sleeping at her side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereafter?--And do you think to look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the terrible pages of that Book
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To find her failings, faults, and errors?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, you will then have other cares,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your own short-comings and despairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your own secret sins and terrors!

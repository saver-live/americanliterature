&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O gift of God! O perfect day:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon shall no man work, but play;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon it is enough for me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be doing, but to be!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through every fibre of my brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through every nerve, through every vein,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the electric thrill, the touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life, that seems almost too much.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the wind among the trees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing celestial symphonies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the branches downward bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like keys of some great instrument.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over me unrolls on high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendid scenery of the sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where though a sapphire sea the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sails like a golden galleon,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards yonder cloud-land in the West,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards yonder Islands of the Blest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose steep sierra far uplifts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its craggy summits white with drifts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow, winds! and waft through all the rooms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow-flakes of the cherry-blooms!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow, winds! and bend within my reach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery blossoms of the peach!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Life and Love! O happy throng
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thoughts, whose only speech is song!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O heart of man! canst thou not be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blithe as the air is, and as free?

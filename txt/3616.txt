<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis time, I think by Wenlock town
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden broom should blow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawthorn sprinkled up and down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should charge the land with snow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring will not wait the loiterer's time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who keeps so long away;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So others wear the broom and climb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgerows heaped with may.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold that I never see;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie long, high snowdrifts in the hedge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will not shower on me.
</pre>

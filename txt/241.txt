<p>It was not mystery or grief,<br> Nor the wise will of fate –<br> It was the impression of strife,<br> Our meetings always left behind.<br> <br> From dawn I'd anticipate<br> The moment when you'd appear,<br> Feeling faint stabbing pains<br> All along my folded arms.<br> <br> And with dry fingers I'd crumple<br> The table's chequered cloth…<br> I knew then, already,<br> How small this earth truly is.<br></p>

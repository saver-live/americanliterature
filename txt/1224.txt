<p>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.<br> I love thee to the depth and breadth and height<br> My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight<br> For the ends of being and ideal grace.<br> I love thee to the level of every day's<br> Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.<br> I love thee freely, as men strive for right.<br> I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.<br> I love thee with the passion put to use<br> In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.<br> I love thee with a love I seemed to lose<br> With my lost saints. I love with the breath,<br> Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,<br> I shall but love thee better after death.</p>

<p> If people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish into the air.<br> The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold.<br> The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.<br> But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.<br> It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.<br> The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas.<br> There is none in the world who can find her but myself.<br> She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.<br> She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand, and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.<br> But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.<br> When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.<br> I sit in the corner where the shadows of the walls meet together.<br> Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she knows where the barber in the story lives.<br> But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story lives.<br> It is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.</p>

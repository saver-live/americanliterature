<p><b>I</b><br> LIKE Crusoe with the bootless gold we stand<br> Upon the desert verge of death, and say:<br> "What shall avail the woes of yesterday<br> To buy to-morrow's wisdom, in the land<br> Whose currency is strange unto our hand?<br> In life's small market they had served to pay<br> Some late-found rapture, could we but delay<br> Till Time hath matched our means to our demand."<br> <br> But otherwise Fate wills it, for, behold,<br> Our gathered strength of individual pain,<br> When Time's long alchemy hath made it gold,<br> Dies with us--hoarded all these years in vain,<br> Since those that might be heir to it the mould<br> Renew, and coin themselves new griefs again.<br> <br> <b>II</b><br> O Death, we come full-handed to thy gate,<br> Rich with strange burden of the mingled years,<br> Gains and renunciations, mirth and tears,<br> And love's oblivion, and remembering hate.<br> Nor know we what compulsion laid such freight<br> Upon our souls--and shall our hopes and fears<br> Buy nothing of thee, Death? Behold our wares,<br> And sell us the one joy for which we wait.<br> Had we lived longer, life had such for sale,<br> With the last coin of sorrow purchased cheap,<br> But now we stand before thy shadowy pale,<br> And all our longings lie within thy keep--<br> Death, can it be the years shall naught avail?<br> <br> "Not so," Death answered, "they shall purchase sleep."</p>

<p>Whence these twelve peaks of Wu-shan!<br> Have they flown into the gorgeous screen<br> From heaven's one corner?<br> Ah, those lonely pines murmuring in the wind!<br> Those palaces of Yang-tai, hovering yonder<br> Oh, the melancholy of it!<br> Where the jeweled couch of the king<br> With brocade covers is desolate,<br> His elfin maid voluptuously fair<br> Still haunting them in vain!<br> <br> Here a few feet<br> Seem a thousand miles.<br> The craggy walls glisten blue and red,<br> A piece of dazzling embroidery.<br> How green those distant trees are<br> Round the river strait of Ching-men!<br> And those ships they go on,<br> Floating on the waters of Pa.<br> The water sings over the rocks<br> Between countless hills<br> Of shining mist and lustrous grass.<br> <br> How many years since these valley flowers bloomed<br> To smile in the sun ?<br> And that man traveling on the river,<br> Hears he not for ages the monkeys screaming?<br> Whoever looks on this,<br> Loses himself in eternity;<br> And entering the sacred mountains of Sung,<br> He will dream among the resplendent clouds. <br></p>

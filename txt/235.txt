<p>I'm not one of those who left their land<br> To the mercy of the enemy.<br> I was deaf to their gross flattery.<br> I won't grant them my songs.<br> <br> But to me the exile's always wretched,<br> Like a convict, or a patient.<br> Wanderer your road is dark,<br> And the bread of strangers tastes bitter.<br> <br> But in the blinding smoke, the flames,<br> Destroying the remains of youth,<br> We have refused to evade<br> A single blow against ourselves.<br> <br> And we know that in the final reckoning,<br> Each hour will stand justifiedâ€¦<br> No people on earth shed fewer tears,<br> Are simpler, or more filled with pride.<br></p>

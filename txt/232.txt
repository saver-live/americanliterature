<p>I'll be there and weariness will vanish.<br> The cold of early morning will please.<br> There are villages, mysterious and dark –<br> Storehouses of immortal labour.<br> <br> My calm and trusting love<br> Of that place will never be vanquished.<br> There's a drop of Novgorod blood<br> In me – a sliver of ice in foaming wine.<br> <br> And that can never be altered,<br> It's un-melted by great heat,<br> And no matter what I may praise –<br> You shine quietly before me.<br></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two good friends had Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singled out from all the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound to him in closest union,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to whom he gave the right hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his heart, in joy and sorrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chibiabos, the musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very strong man, Kwasind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight between them ran the pathway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never grew the grass upon it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing birds, that utter falsehoods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story-tellers, mischief-makers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found no eager ear to listen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not breed ill-will between them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they kept each other's counsel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake with naked hearts together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondering much and much contriving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the tribes of men might prosper.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most beloved by Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the gentle Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the best of all musicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of all singers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful and childlike was he,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave as man is, soft as woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pliant as a wand of willow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stately as a deer with antlers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he sang, the village listened;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the warriors gathered round him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the women came to hear him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he stirred their souls to passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he melted them to pity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the hollow reeds he fashioned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flutes so musical and mellow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the brook, the Sebowisha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceased to murmur in the woodland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the wood-birds ceased from singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rabbit, the Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat upright to look and listen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the brook, the Sebowisha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing, said, "O Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach my waves to flow in music,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly as your words in singing!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Envious, said, "O Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me tones as wild and wayward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me songs as full of frenzy!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyous, said, "O Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me tones as sweet and tender,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me songs as full of gladness!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the whippoorwill, Wawonaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sobbing, said, "O Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me tones as melancholy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me songs as full of sadness!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the many sounds of nature
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowed sweetness from his singing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the hearts of men were softened
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the pathos of his music;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he sang of peace and freedom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang of beauty, love, and longing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang of death, and life undying
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Islands of the Blessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kingdom of Ponemah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the Hereafter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very dear to Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the gentle Chibiabos,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the best of all musicians,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the sweetest of all singers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his gentleness he loved him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magic of his singing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear, too, unto Hiawatha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the very strong man, Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the strongest of all mortals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the mightiest among many;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his very strength he loved him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his strength allied to goodness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idle in his youth was Kwasind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very listless, dull, and dreamy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never played with other children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never fished and never hunted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not like other children was he;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they saw that much he fasted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much his Manito entreated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much besought his Guardian Spirit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazy Kwasind!" said his mother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my work you never help me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Summer you are roaming
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idly in the fields and forests;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Winter you are cowering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the firebrands in the wigwam!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coldest days of Winter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must break the ice for fishing;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my nets you never help me!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door my nets are hanging,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dripping, freezing with the water;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and wring them, Yenadizze!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and dry them in the sunshine!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, from the ashes, Kwasind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, but made no angry answer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lodge went forth in silence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took the nets, that hung together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dripping, freezing at the doorway;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wisp of straw he wrung them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wisp of straw he broke them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not wring them without breaking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such the strength was in his fingers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazy Kwasind!" said his father,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the hunt you never help me;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every bow you touch is broken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snapped asunder every arrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet come with me to the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall bring the hunting homeward."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down a narrow pass they wandered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a brooklet led them onward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the trail of deer and bison
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marked the soft mud on the margin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they found all further passage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut against them, barred securely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the trunks of trees uprooted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying lengthwise, lying crosswise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forbidding further passage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We must go back," said the old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O'er these logs we cannot clamber;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a woodchuck could get through them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a squirrel clamber o'er them!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straightway his pipe he lighted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sat down to smoke and ponder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before his pipe was finished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the path was cleared before him;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the trunks had Kwasind lifted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the right hand, to the left hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurled the cedars light as lances.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazy Kwasind!" said the young men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they sported in the meadow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why stand idly looking at us,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning on the rock behind you?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come and wrestle with the others,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pitch the quoit together!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazy Kwasind made no answer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their challenge made no answer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only rose, and slowly turning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized the huge rock in his fingers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tore it from its deep foundation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poised it in the air a moment,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitched it sheer into the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheer into the swift Pauwating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it still is seen in Summer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once as down that foaming river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the rapids of Pauwating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwasind sailed with his companions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stream he saw a beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw Ahmeek, the King of Beavers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggling with the rushing currents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising, sinking in the water.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without speaking, without pausing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwasind leaped into the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged beneath the bubbling surface,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the whirlpools chased the beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed him among the islands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stayed so long beneath the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That his terrified companions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried, "Alas! good-by to Kwasind!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall never more see Kwasind!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he reappeared triumphant,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon his shining shoulders
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the beaver, dead and dripping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the King of all the Beavers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these two, as I have told you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the friends of Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chibiabos, the musician,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very strong man, Kwasind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long they lived in peace together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake with naked hearts together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondering much and much contriving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the tribes of men might prosper.

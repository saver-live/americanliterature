<p>Caged in this savage capital,<br> We have forgotten forever<br> The townships, the lakes, the steppes,<br> The dawns, of our great motherland.<br> In the circuit of blood-stained days and nights,<br> A bitter languor overcomes usâ€¦<br> No one wishes to come to our aid,<br> Because we choose to remain here,<br> Because, in love with our city,<br> More than the wings of liberty,<br> We preserved to ourselves,<br> Its palaces, flames, and waters.<br> <br> Now another time draws near,<br> The wind of death chills the heart,<br> And Peter's sacred city,<br> Will be our unsought monument.<br></p>

<p>We climbed Yoyang Tower with<br> all the scene around coming<br> into vision; looking up the<br> Great River seeing boats turn<br> and enter the Tungting Lake; geese<br> crying farewell to the river<br> as they flew south; evening falling<br> as if mountain tops upt up the moon<br> with their lips; and we in the Yoyang<br> Tower as if with heads amongst<br> the cloud, drinking wine as if the cups<br> came from heaven itself; then<br> having drunk our fill there blew<br> a cold wind filling out our<br> sleeves, it seeming as though<br> we were dancing in time with it. <br></p>

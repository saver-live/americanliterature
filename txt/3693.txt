<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now dreary dawns the eastern light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fall of eve is drear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cold the poor man lies at night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so goes out the year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little is the luck Ive had,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, tis comfort small
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think that many another lad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has had no luck at all.

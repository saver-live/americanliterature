<p>Died for - North of the Rampart - (to an old tune)<br> <br> We fought for Mulberry Springs<br> Die now for Garlic River.<br> Wash our swords in Parthian Seas,<br> Feed our mounts on T'ien Shan snows.<br> Thousands of miles to and fro.<br> The Three Armies tired and old.<br> These Huns kill instead of ploughing,<br> Sow white bones in desert sand.<br> Ch'in built the Great Wall.<br> Han keeps the bright beacons.<br> These fires never die.<br> These wars never end.<br> Hand to hand we fight and fail,<br> Horses screaming to the skies.<br> Kites and crows pick at our flesh<br> Perch on dead trees with our dead.<br> We paint the grasses red,<br> Because our General had a plan.<br> The sword I say's an evil thing.<br> A wise man keeps it from his hand. <br></p>

<p>A cast-iron fence,<br> A bed of pine,<br> How sweet that I no longer<br> Need to be jealous.<br> <br> A bed's made for me<br> With sobbing and prayer;<br> Now go wherever on earth<br> You wish, God bless you!<br> <br> Now your ears won't burn<br> With frenzied speech,<br> Now a candle won't flicker<br> Till the dawn.<br> <br> We've achieved a peace,<br> And immaculate days…<br> You weep – I'm not worth<br> A single one of your tears.<br></p>

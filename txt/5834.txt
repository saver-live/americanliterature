<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shot an arrow into the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It fell to earth, I knew not where;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not follow it in its flight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I breathed a song into the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It fell to earth, I knew not where;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For who has sight so keen and strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it can follow the flight of song?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long, long afterward, in an oak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the arrow, still unbroke;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the song, from beginning to end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found again in the heart of a friend.

The French guns roll continuously
And our guns, heavy, slow;
Along the Ancre, sinuously,
The transport wagons go,
And the dust is on the thistles
And the larks sing up on high...
<i>But I see the Golden Valley
Down by Tinern on the Wye.</i>

For it's just nine weeks last Sunday
Since we took the Chepstow train,
And I'm wondering if one day
We shall do the like again;

For the four-point-two's come screaming
Tro' the sausages on high;
<i>So there's little use in dreaming
How we walked above the Wye.</i>

Dust and corpses in the thistles
Where the gas-shells burst like snow,
And the shrapnel screams and whistles
On the Becourt road below,
And the High Wood bursts and bristles
Where the mine-clouds foul the sky...
<i>But I'm with you up at Wyndcroft,
Over Tintern on the Wye.</i>

<p>Amidst the flowers a jug of wine, <br> I pour alone lacking companionship. <br> So raising the cup I invite the Moon, <br> Then turn to my shadow which makes three of us. <br> Because the Moon does not know how to drink, <br> My shadow merely follows the movement of my body. <br> The moon has brought the shadow to keep me company a while, <br> The practice of mirth should keep pace with spring. <br> I start a song and the moon begins to reel, <br> I rise and dance and the shadow moves grotesquely. <br> While I'm still conscious let's rejoice with one another, <br> After I'm drunk let each one go his way. <br> Let us bind ourselves for ever for passionless journeyings. <br> Let us swear to meet again far in the Milky Way. <br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many the wonders I this day have seen:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun, when first he kissed away the tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That filled the eyes of Morn; the laurelled peers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from the feathery gold of evening lean; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ocean with its vastness, its blue green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its ships, its rocks, its caves, its hopes, its fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its voice mysterious, which whoso hears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must think on what will be, and what has been.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en now, dear George, while this for you I write,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So scantly, that it seems her bridal night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she her half-discovered revels keeping.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what, without the social thought of thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would be the wonders of the sky and sea?

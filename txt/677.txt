<p>The bright moon lifts from the Mountain of Heaven <br> In an infinite haze of cloud and sea, <br> And the wind, that has come a thousand miles, <br> Beats at the Jade Pass battlements.... <br> China marches its men down Baideng Road <br> While Tartar troops peer across blue waters of the bay.... <br> And since not one battle famous in history <br> Sent all its fighters back again, <br> The soldiers turn round, looking toward the border, <br> And think of home, with wistful eyes, <br> And of those tonight in the upper chambers <br> Who toss and sigh and cannot rest. <br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have revisited the town, thin Shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether to look upon your monument
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I wonder if the builder has been paid)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or happier thoughted when the day is spent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drink of that salt breath out of the sea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When grey gulls flit about instead of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gaunt houses put on majesty:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let these content you and be gone again;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they are at their old tricks yet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your own passionate serving kind who had brought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his full hands what, had they only known,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had given their childrenÂ’s children loftier thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter emotion, working in their veins
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like gentle blood, has been driven from the place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And insult heaped upon him for his pains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for his open-handedness, disgrace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old foul mouth that slandered you had set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pack upon him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, unquiet wanderer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gather the Glasnevin coverlet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About your head till the dust stops your ear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for you to taste of that salt breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listen at the corners has not come;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had enough of sorrow before death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away, away! You are safer in the tomb.

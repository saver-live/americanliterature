<p>ILARIA, thou that wert so fair and dear<br> That death would fain disown thee, grief made wise<br> With prophecy thy husband's widowed eyes,<br> And bade him call the master's art to rear<br> Thy perfect image on the sculptured bier,<br> With dreaming lids, hands laid in peaceful guise<br> Beneath the breast that seems to fall and rise,<br> And lips that at love's call should answer "Here!"<br> <br> First-born of the Renascence, when thy soul<br> Cast the sweet robing of the flesh aside,<br> Into these lovelier marble limbs it stole,<br> Regenerate in art's sunrise clear and wide,<br> As saints who, having kept faith's raiment whole,<br> Change it above for garments glorified.</p>

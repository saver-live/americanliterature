<p>There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the colt from old Regret had got away,<br> And had joined the wild bush horses — he was worth a thousand pound,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.<br> All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had mustered at the homestead overnight,<br> For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.<br> <br> There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man with his hair as white as snow;<br> But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up —<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would go wherever horse and man could go.<br> And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No better horseman ever held the reins;<br> For never horse could throw him while the saddle-girths would stand,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.<br> <br> And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was something like a racehorse undersized,<br> With a touch of Timor pony — three parts thoroughbred at least —<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.<br> He was hard and tough and wiry — just the sort that won't say die —<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was courage in his quick impatient tread;<br> And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.<br> <br> But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old man said, 'That horse will never do<br> For a long and tiring gallop — lad, you'd better stop away,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those hills are far too rough for such as you.'<br> So he waited sad and wistful — only Clancy stood his friend —<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I think we ought to let him come,' he said;<br> 'I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both his horse and he are mountain bred.<br> <br> 'He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough,<br> Where a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man that holds his own is good enough.<br> And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the river runs those giant hills between;<br> I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.'<br> <br> So he went — they found the horses by the big mimosa clump —<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They raced away towards the mountain's brow,<br> And the old man gave his orders, 'Boys, go at them from the jump,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No use to try for fancy riding now.<br> And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ride boldly, lad, and never fear the spills,<br> For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If once they gain the shelter of those hills.'<br> <br> So Clancy rode to wheel them — he was racing on the wing<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the best and boldest riders take their place,<br> And he raced his stock-horse past them, and he made the ranges ring<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stockwhip, as he met them face to face.<br> Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view,<br> And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And off into the mountain scrub they flew.<br> <br> Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resounded to the thunder of their tread,<br> And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead.<br> And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide;<br> And the old man muttered fiercely, 'We may bid the mob good day,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man can hold them down the other side.'<br> <br> When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It well might make the boldest hold their breath,<br> The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wombat holes, and any slip was death.<br> But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer,<br> And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the others stood and watched in very fear.<br> <br> He sent the flint stones flying, but the pony kept his feet,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared the fallen timber in his stride,<br> And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat —<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride.<br> Through the stringy barks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the hillside at a racing pace he went;<br> And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of that terrible descent.<br> <br> He was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the watchers on the mountain standing mute,<br> Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely, he was right among them still,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he raced across the clearing in pursuit.<br> Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals<br> On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the man from Snowy River at their heels.<br> <br> And he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed like a bloodhound on their track,<br> Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And alone and unassisted brought them back.<br> But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur;<br> But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For never yet was mountain horse a cur.<br> <br> And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their torn and rugged battlements on high,<br> Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight in the cold and frosty sky,<br> And where around the Overflow the reedbeds sweep and sway<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide,<br> The man from Snowy River is a household word to-day,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.</p>

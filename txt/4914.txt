<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merry clerks of Oxenford they stretch themselves at ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhelmeted on unbleached sward beneath unshrivelled trees.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the leaves, the leaves, are on the bough, the bark is on the bole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And East and West mens housen stand all even-roofed and whole.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mens housen doored and glazed and floored and whole at every turn!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the Bells of Oxenford ring: Time it is to learn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merry clerks of Oxenford they read and they are told
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of famous men who drew the sword in furious fights of old.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heark and mark it faithfully, but never clerk will write
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What vision rides twixt book and eye from any nearer fight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Whose supplication rends the soul? Whose night-long cries repeat?)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the Bells of Oxenford ring: Time it is to eat!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merry clerks of Oxenford they sit them down anon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At tables fair with silver-ware and naperies thereon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free to refuse or dainty choose what dish shall seem them good;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they have done with single meats, and waters streaked with blood . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That three days fast is overpast when all those guns said Nay!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the Bells of Oxenford ring: Time it is to play!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merry clerks of Oxenford they hasten one by one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or band in companies abroad to ride, or row, or run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By waters level with fair meads all goldenly bespread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where flash Junes clashing dragon-flies but no man bows his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Though bullet-wise Junes dragon flies deride the fearless air!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the Bells of Oxenford ring: Time it is for prayer!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pious clerks of Oxenford they kneel at twilight-tide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For to receive and well believe the Word of Him Who died.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, though no present wings of Death hawk hungry round that place,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their brows are bent upon their hands that none may see their face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who set aside the world and died? What life shall please Him best?)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the Bells of Oxenford ring: Time it is to rest!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merry clerks of Oxenford lie under bolt and bar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest they should rake the midnight clouds or chase a sliding star.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fear of fine and dread rebuke, they round their full-night sleep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave that world which once they took for older men to keep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who walks by dreams what ghostly wood in search of play-mate slain?)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Bells of Oxenford ring in the light again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unburdened breeze, unstricken trees, and all Gods works restored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way live the merry clerks, the clerks of Oxenford!

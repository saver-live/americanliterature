<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I count the dismal time by months and years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last I felt the green sward under foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great breath of all things summer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met mine upon my lips. Now earth appears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As strange to me as dreams of distant spheres
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thoughts of Heaven we weep at. Nature's lute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds on, behind this door so closely shut,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange wild music to the prisoner's ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilated by the distance, till the brain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows dim with fancies which it feels too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ever, with a visionary pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the precluded senses, sweep and Rhine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streams, forests, glades, and many a golden train
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sunlit hills transfigured to Divine.

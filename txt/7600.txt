  Oh, I am grown so free from care
    Since my heart broke!
  I set my throat against the air,
    I laugh at simple folk!
  There's little kind and little fair
    Is worth its weight in smoke
  To me, that's grown so free from care
    Since my heart broke!
  Lass, if to sleep you would repair
    As peaceful as you woke,
  Best not besiege your lover there
    For just the words he spoke
  To me, that's grown so free from care
    Since my heart broke!

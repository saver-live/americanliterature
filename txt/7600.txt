<p> Ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines!<br> I seem to remember the first day when I filled my hands with these jasmines, these white jasmines.<br> I have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth;<br> I have heard the liquid murmur of the river through the darkness of midnight;<br> Autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the lonely waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover.<br> Yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines that I held in my hand when I was a child.<br> Many a glad day has come in my life, and I have laughed with merrymakers on festival nights.<br> On grey mornings of rain I have crooned many an idle song.<br> I have worn round my neck the evening wreath of bakulas woven by the hand of love.<br> Yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh jasmines that filled my hands when I was a child.</p>

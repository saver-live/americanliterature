<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Some poet has observed, that if any man would write down what has really happened to him in this mortal life, he would be sure to make a good book, though he never had met with a single adventure from his birth to his burial; how much more, then, must I, who <i>have</i> had adventures, most singular, pathetic, and unparalleled, be able to compile an instructive and entertaining volume for the use of the public.</p><p>I don't mean to say that I have killed lions, or seen the wonders of travel in the deserts of Arabia or Prussia; or that I have been a very fashionable character, living with dukes and peeresses, and writing my recollections of them as the way now is. I never left this my native isle, nor spoke to a lord (except an Irish one, who had rooms in our house, and forgot to pay three weeks' lodging and extras); but, as our immortal bard observes, I have in the course of my existence been so eaten up by the slugs and harrows of outrageous fortune, and have been the object of such continual and extraordinary ill-luck, that I believe it would melt the heart of a mile-stone to read of it—that is, if a mile-stone had a heart of any thing but stone.</p><p>My adventures contain a part of the history of a great, and, confidently I may say, a <i>good</i> man. I was not a spendthrift like other men. I never wronged any man of a shilling, though I am as sharp a fellow at a bargain as any in Europe. I never injured a fellow-creature; on the contrary, on several occasions, when injured myself, have shown the most wonderful forbearance. I come of a tolerably good family; and yet, born to wealth—of an inoffensive disposition, careful of the money that I had, and eager to get more, I have been going down hill ever since my journey of life began, and have been pursued by a complication of misfortunes such as surely never happened to any man but the unhappy Bob Stubbs.</p><p>Bob Stubbs is my name; and I haven't got a shilling: I have borne the commission of a lieutenant in the service of King George, and am <i>now</i>—but never mind what I am now, for the public will know in a few pages more. My father was of the Suffolk Subbses—a well-to-do gentleman of Bungay. My grandfather had been a respected attorney in that town, and left my papa a pretty little fortune. I was thus the inheritor of competence, and ought to be at this moment a gentleman.</p><p>My misfortunes may be said to have commenced about a year before my birth, when my papa, a young fellow pretending to study the law in London, fell madly in love with Miss Smith, the daughter of a tradesman, who did not give her a sixpence, and afterwards became bankrupt. My papa married this Miss Smith, and carried her off to the country, where I was born, in an evil hour for me.</p><p>Were I to attempt to describe my early years, you would laugh at me as an impostor; but the following letter from mamma to a friend after her marriage, will pretty well show you what a poor foolish creature she was; and what a reckless extravagant fellow was my other unfortunate parent.</p><p>O Eliza! your Susan is the happiest girl under heaven! My Thomas is an angel! not a tall grenadier-like looking fellow, such as I always vowed I would marry:—on the contrary, he is what the world would call dumpy, and I hesitate to confess, that is eyes have a cast in them. But what then? when one of his eyes if fixed on me, and one on my babe, they are lighted up with an affection which my pen cannot describe, and which, certainly, was never bestowed upon any woman so strongly as upon your happy Susan Stubbs.</p><p>When he comes home from shooting, or the farm, if you <i>could</i> see dear Thomas with me and our dear little Bob! as I sit on one knee, and baby on the other, and as he dances us both about. I often wish that we had Sir Joshua, or some great painter, to depict the group; for sure it is the prettiest picture in the whole world, to see three such loving merry people.</p><p>Dear baby is the most lovely little creature that <i>can possibly be</i>,—the very <i>image</i> of papa; he is cutting his teeth, and the delight of <i>every body</i>. Nurse says, that, when he is older, he will get rid of his squint, and his hair will get a <i>great deal</i> less red. Doctor Bates is as kind, and skillful, and attentive as we could desire. Think what a blessing to have had him! Ever since poor baby's birth, it has never had a day of quiet; and he has been obliged to give it from three to four doses every week;—how thankful out we to be that the <i>dear thing</i> is as well as it is! It got through the measles wonderfully;then it had a little rash; and then a nasty hooping cough; and then a fever, and a continual pains in its poor little stomach, crying, poor dear child, from morning till night.</p><p>But dear Tom is an excellent nurse; and many and many a night has he had no sleep, dear man! in consequence of the poor little baby. He walks up and down with it <i>for hours</i>, singing a kind of song (dear fellow, he has no more voice than a tea-kettle), and bobbing his head backwards and forwards, and looking, in his night-cap and dressing-gown, <i>so droll</i>. Oh, Eliza! how you would laugh to see him.</p><p>We have one of the best nursemaids <i>in the world</i>,—an Irish woman, who is as fond of baby almost as his mother (but that can <i>never be</i>). She takes it to walk in the Park for hours together, and I really don't know why Thomas dislikes her. He says she is tipsy very often, and slovenly, which I cannot conceive;—to be sure, the nurse is sadly dirty, and sometimes smells very strong of gin.</p><p>But what of that? these little drawbacks only make home more pleasant. When one thinks how many mothers have <i>no</i> nursemaids: how many poor dear children have no doctors: ought we not to be thankful for Mary Malowney, and that Dr. Bates's bill is forty-seven pounds? How ill must dear baby have been, to require so much physic!</p><p>But they are a sad expense, these dear babies, after all. Fancy, Eliza, how much this Mary Malowney costs us. Ten shillings every week; a glass of brandy or gin at dinner; three pint bottles of Mr. Thrale's best porter every day,—making twenty-one in a week; and nine hundred and ninety in the eleven months she has been with us. Then, for baby, there is Dr. Bates's bill of forty-five guineas, two guineas for christening, twenty for a grand christening supper and ball (rich uncle John mortally offended because he was made godfather, and had to give baby a silver cup; he has struck Thomas out of his will; and old Mr. Firkin quite as much hurt because he was <i>not</i> asked: he will not speak to me or John in consequence); twenty guineas for flannels, laces, little gowns, caps, napkins, and such baby's ware; and all this out of £300 a year! But Thomas expects to make <i>a great deal</i> by his farm.</p><p>We have got the most charming country-house <i>you can imagine: it is quite shut in</i> by trees, and so retired, that, though only thirty miles from London the post comes to us but once a week. The roads, it must be confessed, are execrable; it is winter now, and we are up to our knees in mud and snow. But oh, Eliza! how happy we are: with Thomas (he has had a sad attack of rheumatism, dear man!) and little Bobby, an dour kind friend Dr. Bates, who comes so far to see us, I leave you to fancy that we have a charming merry party, and do not care for all the gayeties of Ranelagh.</p><p>Adieu! dear baby is crying for his mamma: a thousand kisses from your affectionate</p><p>There it is. Doctor’s bills, gentleman-farming, twenty-one pints of porter a week; in this way my unnatural parents were already robbing me of my property.</p><h2>CHAPTER II.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>CHAPTER III.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>CHAPTER V.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>As the month of May is considered, by poets and other philosophers, to be devoted by Nature to the great purpose of love-making, I may as well take advantage of that season and acquaint you with the result of <i>my</i> amours.</p><p>Young, gay, fascinating, and an ensign—I had completely won the heart of my Magdalen; and as for Miss Waters and her nasty uncle the Doctor, there was a complete split between us, as you may fancy; Miss, pretending, forsooth, that she was glad I had broken off the match, though she would have given her eyes, the little minx, to have had it on again. But this was out of the question. My father, who had all sorts of queer notions, said I had acted like a rascal in the business; my mother took my part, in course, and declared I acted rightly, as I always did: and I got leave of absence from the regiment in order to press my beloved Magdalen to marry me out of hand—knowing, from reading and experience, the extraordinary mutability of human affairs.</p><p>Besides, as the dear girl was seventeen years older than myself, and as bad in health as she was in temper, how was I to know that the grim king of terrors might not carry her off before she became mine? With the tenderest warmth, then, and most delicate ardor, I continued to press my suit. The happy day was fixed, the ever memorable 10th of May, 1792; the wedding clothes were ordered; and, to make things secure, I penned a little paragraph for the county paper to this effect:—"Marriage in High Life. We understand that Ensign Stubbs, of the North Bungay Fencibles, and son of Thomas Stubbs, of Sloffemsquiggle, Esquire, is about to lead the hymeneal altar the lovely and accomplished daughter of Solomon Crutty, Esquire, of the same place. A fortune of twenty thousand pounds is, we hear, the lady's portion. ’None but the brave deserve the fair.’"</p><p>"Have you informed your relatives, my beloved," said I to Magdalen one day after sending the above notice; "will any of them attend at your marriage?"</p><p>"Uncle Sam will, I dare say," said Miss Crutty, "dear mamma’s brother."</p><p>"And who <i>was</i> your dear mamma," said I, for Miss Crutty’s respected parent had been long since dead, and I never heard her name mentioned in the family.</p><p>Magdalen blushed, and cast down her eyes to the ground: "Mamma was a foreigner," at last she said.</p><p>"And of what country?"</p><p>"A German; papa married her when she was very young:—she was not of a very good family," said Miss Crutty, hesitating.</p><p>"And what care I for family, my love," said I, tenderly kissing the knuckles of the hand which I held, "she must have been an angel who gave birth to you."</p><p>"She was a shoemaker’s daughter."</p><p>A <i>German shoemaker!</i> hang ’em, thought I, I have had enough of them, and so I broke up this conversation, which did not somehow please me.</p><p>Well, the day was drawing near: the clothes were ordered; the banns were read. My dear mamma had built a cake about the size of a washing-tub: and I was only waiting for a week to pass to put me in possession of twelve thousand pounds in the <i>five</i> per cents., as they were in those days, Heaven bless ’em! Little did I know the storm that was brewing, and the disappointment which was to fall upon a young man who really did his best to get a fortune.</p><p>"O Robert!" said my Magdalen to me, two days before the match was to come off, "I have <i>such</i> a kind letter from uncle Sam, in London. I wrote to him as you wished. He says that he is coming down to-morrow; that he has heard of you often, and knows your character very well, and that he has got a <i>very handsome present</i> for us! What can it be, I wonder?"</p><p>"Is he rich, my soul’s adored?" says I.</p><p>"He is a bachelor with a fine trade, and nobody to leave his money to."</p><p>"His present can’t be less than a thousand pounds," says I.</p><p>"Or, perhaps, a silver tea-set, and some corner dishes," says she.</p><p>But we could not agree to this, it was too little—too mean for a man of her uncle’s wealth: and we both determined it must be the thousand pounds.</p><p>Six o’clock came, and the coach, and the man from the Green Dragon with a portmanteau, and a fat old gentleman walking behind, of whom I just caught a glimpse—a venerable old gentleman—I thought I’d seen him before</p><p>Then there was a ring at the bell; then a scuffling and bumping at the passage: then old Crutty rushed out, and a great laughing and talking and "<i>How are you</i>," and so on, was heard at the door; and then the parlor-door was flung open, and Crutty rushed out with a loud voice:—</p><p>"Good people all! my brother-in-law, Mr. STIFFELKIND!"</p><p><i>Mr. Stiffelkind!</i>—I trembled as I heard the name!</p><p>Miss Crutty kissed him; mamma made him a curtsey, and papa made him a bow; and Dr. Snorter, the parson, seized his hand and shook it most warmly—then came my turn!</p><p>My mamma laughed, and said, "I did not know it, but I am sure, sir, he has as pretty a leg for a boot as any in the whole country."</p><p>Old Stiffelkind roared louder. "A very nice leg ma’am, and a very <i>sheap boot too!</i> Vat, you did not know (and here the monster clapped his hand on the table, and made the punch-ladle tremble in the bowl) p’raps you did not know as dat yong man, dat Stobbs, dat sneaking, baltry, squinting fellow, is as vicked as he is ogly. He bot a pair of boots from me and never paid for dem. Dat is noting, nobody never pays, but be bought a pair of boots, and called himself Lord Cornvallis. And I was fool enough to believe him vonce. But look you, niece Magdalen, I have got five tousand pounds, if you marry him I vil not give you a benny; but look you, what I will gif you, I bromised you a bresent, and I will give you <span style="font-size: 83%;">DESE</span>!"</p><p>And the old monster produced <span style="font-size: 83%;">THOSE VERY BOOTS</span> which Swishtail had made him take back.</p><p>I <i>didn't</i> marry Miss Crutty: I am not sorry for it though. She was a nasty, ugly, ill-tempered wretch, and I’ve always said so ever since.</p><p>And all this arose from those infernal boots, and that unlucky paragraph in the county paper—I’ll tell you how.</p><p>In the first place, it was taken up as a quiz by one of the wicked, profligate, unprincipled organs of the London press, who chose to be very facetious about the "Marriage in High Life," and made all sorts of jokes about me and my dear Miss Crutty.</p><p>Secondly it was read in this London paper by my mortal enemy, Bunting, who had been introduced to old Stiffelkind’s acquaintance by my adventure with him, and had his shoes made regularly by that foreign upstart.</p><p>Thirdly, he happened to want a pair of shoes mended at this particular period, and as he was measured by the disgusting old High-Dutch Cobbler, he told him his old friend Stubbs was going to be married.</p><p>"And to whom?" said old Stiffelkind, "to a voman wit gelt, I vil take my oath."</p><p>"Yes," says Bunting, "a country girl—a Miss Magdalen Carrotty or Crotty, at a place called Sloffemsquiggle."</p><p><i>"Schloffemschwiegel!"</i> bursts out the dreadful boot-maker, "Mein Gott, mein Gott! das geht nicht—I tell you, sare, it is no go. Miss Crotty is my niece. I vill go down myself. I vill never let her marry dat goot-for-noting schwindler and tief." <i>Such</i> was the language that the scoundrel ventured to use regarding me!</p><h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Was there ever such confounded ill luck? My whole life has been a tissue of ill luck: although I have labored, perhaps, harder than any man to make a fortune, something always tumbled it down. In love and in war I was not like others. In my marriages, I had an eye to the main chance: and you see how some unlucky blow would come and throw them over. In the army I was just as prudent, and just as unfortunate. What with judicious betting, and horse-swapping, good luck at billiards, and economy, I do believe I put by my pay every year,—and that is what few can say, who have but an allowance of a hundred a year.</p><p>I’ll tell you how it was. I used to be very kind to the young men; I chose their horses for them, and their wine, and showed them how to play billiards, or ecarté, of long mornings, when there was nothing better to do. I didn't cheat: I’d rather die than cheat;—but if fellows <i>will</i> play, I wasn’t the man to say no—why should I? There was one young chap in our regiment of whom I really think I cleared £300 a year.</p><p>His name was Dobble. He was a tailor’s son, and wanted to be a gentleman. A poor, weak, young creature; easy to be made tipsy; easy to be cheated; and easy to be frightened. It was a blessing for him that I found him; for it any body else had, they would have plucked him of every shilling.</p><p>Ensign Dobble and I were sworn friends. I rode his horse for him, and chose his champagne; and did every thing, in fact, that a superior mind does for an inferior,—when the inferior has got the money. We were inseparables,—hunting every where in couples.</p><p>Well; once, in the year 1793 (it was just when the French had chopped poor Louis’s head off), Dobble and I, gay young chaps as ever wore sword by side, had cast our eyes upon two young ladies, by the name of Brisket, daughters of a butcher in the town where we were quartered. The dear girls fell in love with us, of course. And many a pleasant walk in the country; many a treat to a tea-garden; many a smart ribbon and brooch used Dobble and I (for his father allowed him £600, and our purses were in common) present to these young ladies. One day, fancy our pleasure at receiving a note couched thus:—</p><p>"Deer Capting Stubbs and Dobble—Miss Briskets presents their compliments, and as it is probble that our papa will be till 12 at the corprayshun dinner, we request the pleasure of their company to tea."</p><p>Didn't we go! Punctually at six we were in the little back parlour; we quaffed more Bohea, and made more love, than half-a-dozen ordinary men could. At nine, a little punch-bowl succeeded to the little tea-pot; and bless the girls! a nice fresh steak was friz- zling on the gridiron for our supper. Butchers were butchers then, and their parlor was their kitchen, too; at least old Brisket's was.—One door leading into the shop, and one into the yard, on the other side of which was the slaughter-house.</p><p>Fancy, then, our horror when, just at this critical time, we heard the shop door open, a heavy staggering step on the flags, and a loud husky voice from the shop, shouting, "Hallo, Susan; hallow, Betsey! show a light!" Dobble turned as white as a sheet; the two girls each as red as a lobster; I alone preserved my presence of mind. "The back door," says I.— "The dog's in the court," says they. "He's not so bad as the man," says I. "Stop," cries Susan, flinging open the door, and rushing to the fire: "take <i>this</i>, and perhaps it will quiet him."</p><p>What do you think "<i>this</i>" was? I'm blest if it was not the <i>steak</i>!</p><p>She pushed us out, patted and hushed the dog, and was in again in a minute. The moon was shining on the court, and on the slaugher-house, where there hung a couple of white, ghastly-looking, carcasses of a couple of sheep; a great gutter ran down the court—a gutter of <i>blood!'</i>—the dog was devouring his beef-steak (<i>our</i> beef-steak) in silence,—and we could see through the little window the girls bustling about to pack up the supper-things, and presently the shop-door opened, old Brisket entered, staggering, angry, and drunk. What’s more, we could see, perched on a high stool, and nodding politely, as if to salute old Brisket, the <i>feather of Dobble’s cocked hat!</i> When Dobble saw it he turned white, and deadly sick; and the poor fellow, in an agony of fright, sunk shivering down upon one of the butcher’s cutting blocks, which was in the yard.</p><p>We saw old Brisket looks steadily (as steadily as he could) at the confounded impudent, pert, waggling feather; and then an idea began to draw upon his mind, that there was a head to the hat; and then he slowly rose up—he was a man of six feet, and fifteen stone—he rose up, put on his apron and sleeves, and <i>took down his cleaver</i>. "Betsy," says he, "open the yard door." But the poor girls screamed, and flung on their knees, and begged, and wept, and did their very best to prevent him. "OPEN THE YARD DOOR!" says he, with a thundering loud voice; and the great bull-dog, hearing it, started up and uttered a yell which sent me flying to the other end of the court.—Dobble couldn't move; he was sitting on the block, blubbering like a baby.</p><p>The door opened, and out Mr. Brisket came.</p><p>"<i>To him, Jowler!</i>" says he. "<i>keep him, Jowler</i>!"—and the horrid dog flew at me, and I flew back into the corner, and drew my sword, determining to sell my life dearly.</p><p>"That's it," says Brisket. "Keep him there,—good dog,—good dog! And now, sir," says he, turning round to Dobble, "is this your hat?"</p><p>"Yes," says Dobble, fit to choke with fright.</p><p>"Well, then," says Brisket, "it's my—(hick)—my painful duty to—(hick)—to tell you, that as I've got your hat, I must have your head;—it's painful, but it must be done. You'd better—(hick)—settle yourself com—comfumarably against that—(hick)—that block, and I'll chop it off before you can say Jack—(hick)—no, I mean Jack Robinson."</p><p>Dobble went down on his knees and shrieked out, "I'm an only son, Mr. Brisket! I'll marry her, sir; I will, upon my honor, sir.—Consider my mother, sir; consider my mother."</p><p>"That's it, sir," says Brisket, "that's a good—(hick)—a good boy;—just put your head down quietly—and I'll have it off—yes, off—as if you were Louis the Six—the Sixtix—the Siktickleteenth.—I'll chop the other <i>chap afterwards</i>."</p><p>When I heard this, I made a sudden bound back, and gave such a cry as any man might who was in such a way. The ferocious Jowler, thinking I was going to escape, flew at my throat; screaming furious, I flung out my arms in a kind of desperation,—and, to my wonder, down fell the dog, dead, and run through the body!</p><p>At this moment a posse of people rushed in upon old Brisket,—one of his daughters had had the sense to summon them,—and Dobble's head was saved. And when they saw the dog lying dead at my feet, my ghastly look, my bloody sword, they gave me no small credit for my bravery. "A terrible fellow that Stubbs," said they; and so the mess said, the next day.</p><p>I didn't tell them that the dog had committed <i>suicide</i>—why should I? And I didn't say a word about Dobble's cowardice. I said he was a brave fellow, and fought like a tiger; and this prevented <i>him</i> from telling tales. I had the dog-skin made into a pair of pistol-holders, and looked so fierce, and got such a name for courage in our regiment, that when we had to meet the regulars, Bob Stubbs was always the man put forward to support the honor of the corps. The women, you know, adore courage; and such was my reputation at this time, that I might have had my pick out of half-a-dozen, with three, four, or five thousand pounds a-piece, who were dying for love of me and red coat. But I wasn't such a fool. I had been twice on the point of marriage, and twice disappointed; and I vowed by all the Saints to have a wife, and a rich one. Depend upon this, as an infallible maxim to guide you through life—<i>It’s as easy to get a rich wife as a poor one</i>;—the same bait that will hook a fly will hook a salmon.</p><h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Dobble's reputation for courage was not increased by the butcher's-dog adventure; but mine stood very high: little Stubbs was voted the boldest chap of all the bold North-Bungays. And though i must confess, what was proved by subsequent circumstances, that Nature has <i>not</i> endowed me with a large, or even, I may say, an average share of bravery, yet a man is very willing to flatter himself of the country; and, after a little time, I got to believe that my killing the dog was an action of undaunted courage; and that I was as gallant as any one of the hundred thousand heroes of our army. I always had a military taste—it's only the brutal part of the profession, the horrid fighting, and blood, that I don't like.</p><p>I suppose the regiment was not very brave itself—being only militia; but, certain it was, that Stubbs was considered a most terrible fellow, and I swore so much, and looked so fierce, that you would have fancied I had made half a hundred campaigns. I was second in several duels; the umpire in all disputes; and such a crack-shot myself, that fellows were shy of insulting me. As for Dobble, I took him under my protection; and he became so attached to me that we ate, drank, and rode together, every day; his father didn't care for money, so long as his son was in good company—and what so good as that of the celebrated Stubbs? Heigho! I <i>was</i> good company in those days, and a brave fellow, too, as I should have remained, but for—what I shall tell the public immediately.</p><p>It happened, in the fatal year ninety-six, that the brave North Bungays were quartered at Portsmouth; a maritime place, which I need not describe and which I wish I had never seen. I might have been a General now, or, at least, a rich man. The red-coats carried every thing before them in those days; and I, such a crack character as I was in my regiment, was very well received by the towns-people; many dinners I had; many tea-parties; many lovely young ladies did I lead down the pleasant country-dances.</p><p>Well, although I had had the two former rebuffs in love, which I have described, my heart was still young; and the fact was, knowing that a girl with a fortune was my only chance, I made love here as furiously as ever. I sha'n't describe the lovely creatures on whom I fixed, whilst at Portsmouth. i tried more than—several—and it is a singular fact, which I never have been able to account for, that, successful as I was with ladies of maturer age, by the young ones I was refused regular.</p><p>But "faint heart never one fair lady;" and so I went on, and on, until I had really got a Miss Clopper, a tolerably rich navy-contractor's daughter, into such a way, that I really don't think she could have refused me. Her brother, Captain Clopper, was in a line regi- ment, and helped me as much as ever he could; he swore I was such a brave fellow.</p><p>As I had received a number of attentions from Clopper, I determined to invite him to dinner; which I could do without any sacrifice of my principle, upon this point; for the fact is, Dobble lived at an inn—and as he sent all his bills to his father, I made no scruple to use his table. We dined in the coffee-room; Dobble bringing his friend, and so we made a party <i>carry</i>, as the French say. Some naval officers were occupied in a similar way, at a table next to ours.</p><p>Well—I didn’t spare the bottle, either for myself or my friends; and we grew very talkative, and very affectionate as the drinking went on. Each man told stories of his gallantry in the field, or amongst the ladies, as officers will, after dinner. Clopper confided to the company his wish that I should marry his sister, and vowed that he thought me the best fellow in Christendom.</p><p>Ensign Dobble assented to this—"But let Miss Clopper beware," says he, "for Stubbs is a sad fellow; he has had, I don’t know how many <i>liasons</i> already; and he has been engaged to I don’t know how many women."</p><p>"Indeed!" says Clopper; "Come, Stubbs, tell us your adventures."</p><p>"Psha!" said I, modestly, "there is nothing, indeed, to tell; I have been in love, my dear boy—who has not?—and I have been jilted—who has not?"</p><p>Clopper swore that he would blow his sister’s brains out if ever <i>she</i> served me so.</p><p>"Tell him about Miss Crutty," said Dobble; "he! he! Stubbs served <i>that</i> woman out, any how; she didn’t jilt <i>him</i>, I’ll be sworn."</p><p>"Really, Dobble, you are too bad, and should not mention names; the fact is, the girl was desperately in love with me, and had money—sixty thousand pounds, upon my reputation. Well, every thing was arranged, when, who should come down from London, but a relation."</p><p>"Well; and did he prevent the match?"</p><p>"Prevent it—yes, sir, I believe you, he did; though not in the sense that <i>you</i> mean; he would have given his eyes; ay, and ten thousand pounds more, if I would have accepted the girl, but I would not."</p><p>"Why, in the name of goodness?"</p><p>"Sir, her uncle was a <i>shoemaker</i>. I never would debase myself by marrying into such a family."</p><p>"Of course not," said Dobble, "he couldn't, you know. Well, now—tell him about the other girl, Mary Waters, you know."</p><p>"Hush, Dobble, hush! don't you see one of those naval officers has turned round and heard you. My dear Clopper, it was a mere childish bagatelle."</p><p>"Well, but let’s have it," said Clopper, "let’s have it; I won't tell my sister, you know;" and he put his hand to his nose, and looked monstrous wise.</p><p>"Nothing of that sort, Clopper—no, no—’pon honor—little Bob Stubbs is no <i>libertine</i>; and the story is very simple. You see that my father has a small place, merely a few hundred acres, at Sloffemsquiggle: Isn't it a funny name? Hang it, there’s the naval gentleman staring again,—(I looked terribly fierce as I returned this officer’s stare, and continued in a loud careless voice) well—at this Sloffemsquiggle there lived a girl, a Miss Waters, the niece of some blackguard apothecary in the neighborhood; but my mother took a fancy to the girl, and had her up to the park, and petted her. We were both young—and—and—the girl fell in love with me, that’s the fact. I was obliged to repel some rather warm advances that she made me; and here, upon my honor as a gentleman, you have all the story about which that silly Dobble made such a noise."</p><p>Just as I finished this sentence, I found myself suddenly taken by the nose, and a voice shouting out,</p><p>"Mr. Stubbs, you are a Liar and a Scoundrel! take this, sir,—and this, for daring to meddle with the name of an innocent lady."</p><p>I turned round a well as I could, for the ruffian had pulled me out of my chair, and beheld a great marine monster, six feet high, who was occupied in beating and kicking me, in the most ungentlemanly manner, on my cheeks, my ribs, and between the tails of my coat. "He is a liar, gentleman, and a scoundrel; the bootmaker had detecte him in swindling, and so his niece refused him. Miss Waters was engaged to him from childhood, and he deserted her for the bootmaker’s niece, who was richer;"—and then sticking a card between my stock and my coat-collar, in what is called the scruff of my neck, the disgusting brute gave me another blow behind my back, and left the coffee-room with his friends.</p><p>Dobble raised me up; and taking the card from my neck, read, CAPTAIN WATERS. Clopper poured me out a glass of water, and said in my ear, "If this is true, you are an infernal scoundrel, Stubbs; and must fight me, after Captain Waters," and he flounced out of the room.</p><p>After this adventure I became sick of a military life—at least the life of my own regiment, where the officers, such was their unaccountable meanness and prejudice against me, absolutely refused to see me at mess. Colonel Craw sent me a letter to this effect which I treated as it deserved.—I never once alluded to it in any way, and have never spoken a single word to any man in the North Bungays.</p><h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>See, now, what life is; I have had ill-luck on ill-luck from that day to this. I have sunk in the world, and, instead of riding my horse and drinking my wine, as a real gentleman should, have hardly enough now to buy a pint of ale; ay, and am very glad when any body will treat me to one. Why, why was I born to undergo such unmerited misfortunes?</p><p>You must know that very soon after my adventure with Miss Crutty, and that cowardly ruffian Captain Waters (he sailed the day after his insult to me or I should most certainly have blown his brains out; <i>now</i> he is living in England, and is my relation; but, of course, I cut the fellow). Very soon after these painful events another happened, which ended, too, in a sad disappointment. My dear papa died, and, instead of leaving five thousand pounds as I expected, at the very least, left only his estate, which was worth but two. The land and house were left to me; to mamma and my sisters he left, to be sure, a sum of two thousand pounds in the hands of that eminent firm Messrs. Pump, Aldgate, and Co., which failed within six months after his demise; and paid in five years about one shilling and ninepence in the pound; which really was all my dear mother and sisters had to live upon.</p><p>The poor creatures were quite unused to money matters; and, would you believe it? when the news came of Pump and Aldgate’s failure, mamma only smiled, and threw her eyes up to Heaven, and said, "Blessed be God, that we have still wherewithal to live; there are tens of thousands in this world, dear children, who would count our poverty, riches." And with this she kissed my two sisters, who began to blubber, as girls always will do, and threw their arms round her neck, and then round my neck, until I was half stifled with their embraces, and slobbered all over with their tears.</p><p>"Dearest mamma," said I, "I am very glad to see the noble manner in which you bear your loss; and more still to know that you are so rich as to be able to put up with it." The fact was, I really thought the old lady had got a private hoard of her own, as many of them have—a thousand pounds or so in a stocking. Had she put by thirty pounds a year, as well she might, for the thirty years of her marriage, there would have been nine hundred pounds clear, and no mistake. But still I was angry to think that any such paltry concealment had been practised—concealment too of <i>my</i> money; so I turned on her pretty sharply and continued my speech. "You say, ma’am, that you are rich, and that Pump and Aldgate’s failure has no effect upon you. I am very happy to hear you say so, ma’am—very happy that you <i>are</i> rich; and I should like to know where your property, my father’s property, for you had none of your own,—I should like to know where this money lies—<i>where you have concealed</i> <i>it</i>, ma'am; and, permit me to say, that when I agreed to board you and my two sisters for eighty pounds a year, I did not know that you had <i>other</i> resources than those mentioned in my blessed father's will."</p><p>This I said to her because I hated the meanness of concealment, not because I lost by the bargain of boarding them, for the three poor things did not eat much more than sparrows: and I've often since calculated that I had a clear twenty pounds a year profit out of them.</p><p>Mamma and the girls looked quite astonished when I made the speech. "What does he mean?" said Lucy to Eliza.</p><p>Mamma repeated the question. "My beloved Robert, what concealment are you talking of?"</p><p>"I am talking of concealed property, Ma'am," says I sternly.</p><p>"And do you—what—can you—do you really suppose that I have concealed—any of that blessed sa-a-a-aint's prop-op-op-operty?" screams out mamma. "Robert," says she—"Bob, my own darling boy—my fondest, best beloved, now <i>he</i> is gone" meaning my late governor—more tears), "you don't, you cannot fancy that your own mother, who bore you, and nursed you, and wept for you, and would give her all to save you from a moment's harm—you don't suppose that she would che-e-e-eat you!" and here she gave a louder screech than ever, and flung back on the sofa; and one of my sisters went and tumbled into her arms, and t'other went round, and the kissing and slobbering scene went on again, only I was left out, thank goodness; I hate such sentimentality.</p><p>"<i>Che-e-eat me</i>," says I, mocking her. "What do you mean, then, by saying you're so rich? Say, have you got money or have you not?" (and I rapped out a good number of oaths, too, which I don't put in here; but I was in a dreadful fury, that's the fact.)</p><p>"So help me, Heaven," says mamma, in answer, going down on her knees, and smacking her two hands; "I have but a Queen Anne's guinea in the whole of this wicked world."</p><p>"Then what, madam, induces you to tell these absurd stories to me, and to talk about your riches, when you know that you and your daughters are beggars, Ma'am, <i>beggars</i>?"</p><p>"My dearest boy, have we not got the house, and the furniture, and a hundred a year still; and have you not great talents which will make all our fortunes?" says Mrs. Stubbs, getting up off her knees, and making believe to smile as she clawed hold of my hand and kissed it.</p><p>This was <i>too</i> cool. "<i>You</i> have got a hundred a year, Ma'am," says I—"<i>you</i> have got a house: upon my soul and honor this is the first I ever heard of it; and I'll tell you what, Ma'am," says I (and it cut her <i>pretty sharply</i> too), "as you've got it, <i>you’d better go and live in it</i>. I've got quite enough to do with my own house, and every penny of my own income."</p><p>Upon this speech the old lady said nothing, but she gave a screech loud enough to be heard from here to York, and down she fell—kicking and struggling in a regular fit.</p><p>I did not see Mrs. Stubbs for some days after this, and the girls used to come down to meals, and never speak; going up again and stopping with their mother At last, one day, both of them came in very solemn to my study, and Eliza, the eldest, said, "Robert, mamma has paid you our board up to Michaelmas."</p><p>"She has," says I; for I always took precious good care to have it in advance.</p><p>"She says, John, that on Michaelmas day—we’ll—we'll go away, John."</p><p>"O, she’s going to her own house, is she, Lizzy? very good; she’ll want the furniture, I suppose, and that she may have too, for I’m going to sell the place myself;" and so <i>that</i> matter was settled.</p><p>On Michaelmas day, and during these two months, I hadn't, I do believe, seen my mother twice (once, about two o’clock in the morning, I woke and found her sobbing over my bed). On Michaelmas day morning, Eliza comes to me and says, "<i>John, they will come and fetch us at six this evening.</i>" Well, as this was the last day, I went and got the best goose I could find (I don't think I ever saw a primer, or ate more hearty myself), and had it roasted at three, with a good pudding afterwards; and a glorious bowl of punch. "Here’s a health to you, dear girls," says I, "and you, ma, and good luck to all three, and as you've not eaten a morsel, I hope you won't object to a glass of punch. It’s the old stuff, you know, ma’am, that that Waters sent to my father fifteen years ago."</p><p>Six o’clock came, and with it came a fine barouche, as I live! Captain Waters was on the box (it was his coach); that old thief, Bates, jumped out, entered my house, and, before I could say Jack Robinson, whipped off mamma to the carriage; the girls followed, just giving me a hasty shake of the hand, and as mamma was helped in, Mary Waters, who was sitting inside, flung her arms round her, and round the girls, and the Doctor, who acted footman, jumped on the box, and off they went; taking no more notice of <i>me</i> than if I’d been a nonentity.</p><p>There’s the picture of the whole business;—that’s mamma and Miss Waters sitting kissing each other in the carriage, with the two girls in the back seat; Waters is driving (a precious bad driver he is too), and that's me, standing at the garden door, and whistling. You can’t see Mary Malowney; the old fool is crying behind the garden gate; she went off next day along with the furniture; and I to get into that precious scrape which I shall mention next.</p><h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>After my papa’s death, as he left me no money, and only a little land, I put my estate into an auctioneer’s hands, and determined to amuse my solitude with a trip to some of our fashionable watering places. My house was now a desert to me. I need not say how the departure of my dear parent, and her children, left me sad and lonely.</p><p>Well, I had a little ready money, and, for the estate, expected a couple of thousand pounds. I had a good military-looking person; for though I had absolutely cut the North-Bungays (indeed, after my affair with Waters, Colonel Craw hinted to me, in the most friendly manner, that I had better resign), though I had left the army, I still retained the rank of Captain; knowing the advantages attendant upon that title, in a watering-place tour.</p><p>Captain Stubbs became a great dandy at Cheltenham, Harrowgate, Bath, Leamington, and other places. I was a good whist and billiard player; so much so, that in many of these towns, the people used to refuse, at last, to play with me, knowing how far I was their superior. Fancy, my surprise, about five years after the Portsmouth affair, when strolling one day up the High street, in Leamington, my eyes lighted upon a young man, whom I remembered in a certain butcher's yard, and elsewhere—no other, in fact, than Dobble. He, too, was dressed <i>en militaire</i>, with a frogged coat and spurs; and was walking with a showy-looking, Jewish-faced, black-haired lady, glittering with chains and rings, with a green bonnet, and a bird of Paradise—a lilac shawl, a yellow gown, pink silk stockings, and light-blue shoes. Three children, and a handsome footman, were walking behind her, and the party, not seeing me, entered the Royal Hotel together.</p><p>I was known, myself, at the Royal, and calling one of the waiters, learned the names of the lady and gentleman. He was Captain Dobble, the son of the rich army clothier, Dobble (Dobble, Hobble &amp; Co., of Pall Mall);—the lady was a Mrs. Manasseh, widow of an American Jew, living quietly at Leamington with her children, but possessed of an immense property. There's no use to give one’s self out to be an absolute pauper; so the fact is, that I myself, went every where with the character of a man of very large means. My father had died, leaving me immense sums of money, and landed estates—ah! I was the gentleman, and every body was too happy to have me at table.</p><p>Well, I came the next day, and left a card for Dobble, with a note:—he neither returned my visit, nor answered my note. The day after, however, I met him with the widow, as before; and, going up to him, very kindly seized him by the hand, and swore I was—as really was the case—charmed to see him. Dobble hung back, to my surprise, and I do believe the creature would have cut me, if he dared; but I gave him a frown, and said—</p><p>"What, Dobble, my boy, don't you recollect old Stubbs, and our adventure with the butcher's daughters, ha?"</p><p>Dobble gave a sickly kind of grin, and said, "Oh! ah! yes! It is—yes! it is, I believe, Captain Stubbs!"</p><p>"An old comrade, madam, of Captain Dobble’s, and one who has heard so much, and seen so much, of your ladyship, that he must take the liberty of begging his friend to introduce him."</p><p>Dobble was obliged to take the hint; and Captain Stubbs was duly presented to Mrs. Manasseh; the lady was as gracious as possible: and when, at the end of the walk, we parted, she said, "she hoped Captain Dobble would bring me to her apartments that evening, where she expected a few friends." Every body, you see, knows every body at Leamington; and I, for my part, was well known as a retired officer of the army; who, on his father’s death, had come into seven thousand a year. Dobble’s arrival had been subsequent to mine, but putting up, as he did, at the Royal Hotel, and dining at the ordinary there with the ow, he had made his acquaintance before I had. I saw, however, that if I allowed him to talk about me, as he could, I should be compelled to give up all my hopes and pleasures at Leamington; and so i determined to be short with him. As soon as the lady had gone into the hotel, my friend, Dobble, was for leaving me likewise; but I stopped him, and said, "Mr. Dobble, I saw what you meant just now, you wanted to cut me, because, forsooth, I did not choose to fight a duel at Portsmouth; now look you, Dobble, I am no hero, but I'm not such a coward as you—and you know it. You are very different man to deal with from Waters; and <i>I will fight</i> this time"</p><p>He was very thick with the widow; but that lady had a very capacious heart, and tehre were a number of other gentlemen who seemed equally smitten with her. "Look at that Mrs. Manasseh," said a gentleman (it was droll, <i>he</i> was a Jew, too), sitting at dinner by me; "she is old, and ugly, and, yet, because she has money, all the men are flinging themselves at her."</p><p>"She has money, has she?"</p><p>Eighty thousand pounds, and twenty thousand for each of her children; I know it <i>for a fact</i>," said the strange gentleman. "I am in the law, and we, of our faith, you know, know pretty well what the great families amongst us are worth."</p><p>"Who was Mr. Manasseh?" said I.</p><p>"A man of enormous wealth—a tobacco merchant—West Indies; a fellow of no birth, however; and who, between ourselves, married a woman that is not much better than she should be. My dear sir," whispered he, "she is always in love—now it is with that Captain Dobble; last week it was somebody else—and it may be you next week, if—ha! ha! ha!—you are disposed to enter the lists.</p><p>"I wouldn't, for <i>my</i> part, have the woman, with twice her money."</p><p>What did it matter to me, whether the woman was good, or not, provided she was rich? My course was quite clear. I told Dobble all that this gentleman had informed me, and, being a pretty good hand at making a story, I made the widow appear <i>so</i> bad, that the poor fellow was quite frightened, and fairly quitted the field. Ha! ha! I'm dashed if I did not make him believe that Mrs. Manasseh had <i>murdered</i> her last husband.</p><p>I played my game so well, thanks to the information that my friend, the lawyer, had given me, that, in a month, I had got the widow to show a most decided partiality for me; I sat by her at dinner, I drank with her at the well—I rode with her, I danced with her, and, at a pic-nic to Kenilworth, where we drank a good deal of champagne, I actually popped the question, and was accepted. In another month, Robert Stubbs, Esq., led to the altar, Leah, widow of the late Z. Manasseh, Esq., of St. Kitt's!</p><p>We drove up to London in her comfortable chariot; the children and servants following in a post-chaise. I paid, of course, for everything; and until our house, in Berkeley square, was painted, we stopped at Steven's hotel.</p><p>My own estate had been sold, and the money was lying at a bank, in the city. About three days after our arrival, as we took our breakfast in the hotel, previous to a visit to Mrs. Stubbs’s banker, where certain little transfers were to be made—a gentleman was introduced, who, I saw at a glance, was of my wife’s persuasion.</p><p>He looked at Mrs. Stubbs, and made a bow; "Perhaps it will be convenient to you to pay this little bill, one hundred and fifty-two pounds."</p><p></p><h2>CHAPTER X.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I shall not describe my feelings when I found myself in a cage in Cursitor street, instead of that fine house in Berkeley square, which was to have been mine as the husband of Mrs. Mannasseh. What a palace!—in an odious, dismal street leading from Chancery lane—a hideous Jew boy opened the second of three doors; and shut when Mr. Nabb and I (almost fainting) had entered: then he opened the third door, and then I was introduced to a filthy place, called a coffee-room, which I exchanged for the solitary comfort of a little dingy back parlor, where I was left for a while to brood over my miserable fate. Fancy the change between this and Berkeley square! Was I, after all my pains, and cleverness, and perseverance, cheated at last? Had this Mrs. Manasseh been imposing upon me, and were the words of the wretch I met at teh table-d'hote at Leamington, only meant to mislead me and take me in? I determined to send for my wife, and know the whole truth. I saw at once that I had been the victim of an infernal plot, and that the carriage, the house in town, the West India fortune, were only so many lies which I had blindly believed. It was true the debt was but a hundred and fifty pounds; and I had two thousand at my bankers. But was the loss of <i>her</i> £80,000 nothing? Was the destruction of my hopes nothing?—The accursed addition to my family of a Jewish wife, and three Jewish children nothing? and all these I was to support out of my two thousand pounds. I had better have stopped at home, with my mamma and sisters, whom I really did love, and who produced me eighty pounds a year.</p><p>I had a furious interview with Mrs. Stubbs; and when I charged her, the base wretch! with cheating me, like a brazen serpent, as she was, she flung back the cheat in my teeth, and swore I had swindled her. Why did I marry her, when she might have had twenty others? She only took me, she said, because I had twenty thousand pounds. I <i>had</i> said I possessed that sum; but in love, you know, and war, all’s fair.</p><p>We parted quite as angrily as we met; and I cordially vowed that when I had paid the debt into which I had been swindled by her, I would take my £2,000, and depart to some desert island; or, at the very least, to America, and never see her more, or any of her Israelitish brood. There was no use in remaining in the spunging-house (for I knew that there were such things as detainers, and that where Mr. Stubbs owed a hundred pounds, she might owe a thousand), so I sent for Mr. Nabb, and tendering him a check for £150, and his costs, requested to be let out forthwith. "Here, fellow," said I, "is a check on Child’s for your paltry sum."</p><p>"It may be a sheck on Shild’s," says Mr. Nabb, "but I should be a baby to let you out on such a paper as dat." "Well," said I, "Child's is but a step from this: you may go and get the cash,—just giving me an acknowledgment."</p><p>Nabb drew out the acknowledgment with great punctuality, and set off for the bankers, whilst I prepared myself for departure from this abominable prison.</p><p>He smiled as he came in. "Well," said I, "you have touched your money; and now, I must tell you, that you are the most infernal rogue and extortioner I ever met with."</p><p>"O no, Mishter Shtubbsh," says he, grinning still, "dere is som greater roag dan me,—mosh greater."</p><p>"Fellow," says I, "don't stand grinning before a gentleman; but give me my hat and cloak, and let me leave your filthy den."</p><p>"Shtop, Shtubbsh," says he, not even Mistering me this time, "here ish a letter, vich you had better read."</p><p>I opened the letter: something fell to the ground: —it was my check. The letter ran thus: "Messrs. Childs &amp; Co. present their compliments to Captain Stubbs, and regret that they have been obliged to refuse payment of the inclosed, having been served this day with an attachment by Messrs. Solomonson &amp; Co., which compels them to retain Captain Stubbs’s balance of £2,010 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d</i>. until the decision of the suit of Solomonson <i>v</i>. Stubbs.</p><p>"Fleet street."</p><p>"You see," says Mr. Nabb, as I read this dreadful letter, "you see, Shtubbsh, dere vas two debts,—a little von, and a big von. So dey arrested you for de little von, and attashed your money for de big von."</p><p>Don't laugh at me for telling this story; if you knew what tears are blotting over the paper as I write it; if you knew that for weeks after i was more like a madman than a sane man,—a madman in the Fleet prison, where I went, instead of to the desert island. What had I done to deserve it? Hadn’t I always kept an eye to the main chance? Hadn’t I lived economi cally, and not like other young men? Had I ever been known to squander or give away a single penny? No! I can lay my hand on my heart, and, thank Heaven, say, No! Why, why was I punished so?</p><p>Let me conclude this miserable history. Seven months—my wife saw me once or twice, and then dropped me altogether—I remained in that fatal place. I wrote to my dear mamma, begging her to sell her furniture, but got no answer. All my old friend turned their backs upon me. My action went against me—I had not a penny to defend it. Solomonson proved my wife’s debt, and seized my two thousand pounds.—As for the detainer against me, I was obliged to go through the court for the relief of insolvent debtors. I passed through it, and came out a beggar. But, fancy the malice of that wicked Stiffelkind; he appeared in court as my creditor for £3, with sixteen years’ interest, at five per cent., for a <span style="font-size: 83%;">PAIR OF TOP BOOTS.</span> The old thief produced them in court, and told the whole story—Lord Cornwallis, the detection, pumping, and all.</p><p>Commissioner Dubobwig was very funny about it. "So Doctor Swishtail would not pay you for the boots, eh, Mr. Stiffelkind?"</p><p>"No; he said, ven I asked him for payment, dey was ordered by a yong boy, and I ought to have gone to his schoolmaster."</p><p>"What, then, you came on the <i>bootless</i> errand, ay, sir?" (A laugh.)</p><p>"Bootless! no sare, I brought de boots back vid me; how de devil else could I show dem to you." (Another laugh.)</p><p>"You’ve never <i>soled</i> ’em since, Mr. Tickleshins?"</p><p>"I never would sell dem; I svore I never vood, on porpus to be revenged on dat Stubbs."</p><p>"What, your wound has never been <i>healed</i>, eh?"</p><p>"Vat de you mean vid your bootless errants, and your soling and healing? I tell you I have done vat I svore to do; I have exposed him at school, I have broak off a marriage for him, ven he vould have had tventy tousand pound, and now I have showed him up in a court of justice; dat is vat I ave done, and dat’s enough." And then the old wretch went down, whilst every body was giggling and staring at poor me—as if I was not miserable enough already.</p><p>"This seems the dearest pair of boots you ever had in your life, Mr. Stubbs," said Commissioner Dubobwig very archly, and then he began to inquire about the rest of my misfortunes.</p><p>In the fulness of my heart I told him the whole of them; how Mr. Solomonson the attorney had introduced me to the rich widow, Mrs. Manasseh, who had fifty thousand pounds, and an estate in the West Indies. How I was married, and arrested on coming to town, and cast in an action for two thousand pounds, brought against me by this very Solomonson for my wife's debts.</p><p>"Stop," says a lawyer in the court, "Is this woman a showy black-haired woman, with one eye? very often drunk, with three children—Solomonson, short with red hair?"</p><p>"Exactly so," says I, with tears in my eyes..</p><p>"That woman has married <i>three men</i> within the last two years. One in Ireland, and one at Bath. A Solomonson is, I believe, her husband, and they both are off for America ten days ago."</p><p>"But why did you not keep your ₤2,000?" said the lawyer.</p><p>"Sir, they attached it."</p><p>"O! well, we may pass you; you have been unlucky, Mr. Stubbs, but it seems as if the biter had been bit in this affair."</p><p>"No," said Mr. Dubobwig, "Mr. Stubbs is the victim of a FATAL ATTACHMENT."</p><h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>I <span style="font-size: 83%;">WAS</span> a free man when I went out of the court; but I was a beggar—I, Captain Stubbs, of the bold North Bungays, did not know where I could get a bed or a dinner.</p><p>As I was marching sadly down Portugal street, I felt a hand on my shoulder, and a rough voice which I knew well.</p><p>"Vell, Mr. Stobbs, have I not kept my promise? I told you dem boots would be your ruin."</p><p>I was much too miserable to reply; and only cast up my eyes towards the roofs of the houses, which I could not see for the tears.</p><p>"Vat! you begin to gry and blobber like a shild? you vood marry, vood you, and noting vood do for you but a vife vid monny—ha, ha—but you vere de pigeon, and she vas de grow. She has plocked you, too, pretty vell—eh? ha! ha!"</p><p>"O, Mr. Stiffelkiknd," said I, "don't laugh at my misery; she has not left me a single shilling under heaven And I shall starve, I do believe I shall starve." And I began to cry fit to break my heart.</p><p>"Starf! stoff and nonsense—you vil never die of starfing—you vil die of <i>hanging</i>, I tink, ho! ho! and it is moch easier vay too." I didn't say a word, but cried on: till every body in the street turned round and stared.</p><p>"Come, come," said Stiffelkind, "do not gry, Gaptain Stobbs—it is not got for a Gaptain to gry, ha! ha! Dere—come vid me, and you shall have a dinner, and a bregfast too—vich shall gost you nothing, until you can bay vid your earnings."</p><p>And so this curious old man, who had persecuted me all through my prosperity, grew compassionate towards me in my ill-luck; and took me home with him as he promised. "I saw your name among de solvents—and I vowed, you know, to make you repent dem boots. Dere, now, it is done and forgotten, look you. Here Betty, Bettchen, make de spare bed, and put a clean knife and fork; Lort Cornvallis is come to dine vid me."</p><p>I lived with this strange old man for six weeks. I kept his books, and did what little I could to make myself useful: carrying about books and shoes, as if I had never borne His Majesty’s commission. He gave me no money, but he fed and lodged me comfortably. The men and boys used to laugh, and call me General, and Lord Cornwallis, and all sorts of nick-names—and old Stiffelkind made a thousand new ones for me.</p><p>One day, I can recollect—one miserable day, as I was polishing on the trees a pair of boots of Mr. Stiffelkind’s manufacture—the old gentleman came into the shop, with a lady on his arm.</p><p>"Vere is Gaptain Stobbs," says he, "vere is dat ornament to His Majesty's service?"</p><p>"Look, my dear," says he, "here is an old friend of yours, His Excellency Lort Cornvallis!—Who would have thought such a nobleman vood turn shoeblack? Gaptain Stobbs, here is your former flame, my dear niece, Miss Grotty—how could you, Magdalen, ever leaf soch a lof of a man? Shake hands vid her, Gaptain;—dere, never mind de blacking;" but Miss drew back.</p><p>"I never shake hands with a <i>shoeblack,</i>" says she, mighty contemptuous.</p><p>"Bah! my lof, his fingers vont soil you, don't you know he has just been <i>vitevashed?</i>"</p><p>"I wish, uncle," says she, "you would not leave me with such low people."</p><p>"Low, because he cleans boots? de Gaptain prefers <i>pumps</i> to boots I tink, ha! ha!"</p><p>"Captain, indeed! a nice Captain," says Miss Crutty, snapping her fingers in my face, and walking away; "a Captain, who has had his nose pulled! ha! ha!"—And how could I help it? it wasn't by my own <i>choice</i> that that ruffian Waters took such liberties with me; didn't I show how averse i was to all quarrels by refusing altogether his challenge?—but such is the world: and thus the people at Stiffelkind’s used to tease me until they drove me almost mad.</p><p>At last he came home one day more merry and abusive than ever. "Gaptain," says he, "I have goot news for you—a goot place. Your lortship vill not be able to geep your garriage, but you vil be gomfortable and serve His Majesty.</p><p>"Serve His Majesty," says I: "dearest Mr. Stiffelkind, have you got me a palce under Government?"</p><p>"Yes, and somting better still—not only a place, but a uniform—yes, Gabdain Stobbs, a <i>red goat</i>."</p><p>"A red coat! I hope you don’t think I would demean myself by entering the ranks of the army. I am a gentleman, Mr. Stiffelkind—I can never—no, I never."</p><p>"No, I know you will never—you are too great a goward, ha!—though dis is a red goat, and a place where you must give some <i>hard knocks</i> too, ha! ha!—do you gomprehend?—and you shall be a general, instead of a gabdain—ha! ha!"</p><p>"A general in a red goat! Mr. Stiffelkind?"</p><p>"Yes, a GENERAL BOSTMAN! ha! ha! I have been vid your old friend, Bunting, and he has an uncle in the Post Office, and he has got you de place—eighteen shillings a veek, you rogue, and your goat. You must not oben any of de letters, you know."</p><p>And so it—I, Robert Stubbs, Esquire, became the vile thing he named—a general postman!</p><p>I was so disgusted with Stiffelkind’s brutal jokes, which were now more brutal than ever; that when I got my place in the Post Office, I never went near the fellow again—for though he had done me a favor in keeping me from starvation, he certainly had done it in a very rude, disagreeable manner, and showed a low and mean spirit in <i>shoving</i> me into such a degraded placed as that of postman. But what had I to do? I submitted to fate, and for three years or more, Robert Stubbs, of the North Bungay Fencibles, was ——</p><p>I wonder nobody recognized me. I lived in daily fear the first year; but, afterwards, grew accustomed to my situation, as all great men will do, and wore my red coat as naturally as if I had been sent into the world only for the purpose of being a letter-carrier.</p><p>I was first in the Whitechapel district, where I stayed for nearly three years, when I was transferred to Jermyn-street, and Duke-street—famous places for lodgings. I suppose I left a hundred letters at a house in the latter street, where lived some people who must have recognized me had they but once chanced to look at me</p><p>You see, that when I left Sloffem, and set out in the gay world, my mamma had written to me a dozen times at least, but I never answered her, for I knew she wanted money, and I detest writing. Well, she stopped her letters, finding she could get none from me:—but when I was in the Fleet, as I told you, I wrote repeatedly to my dear mamma, and was not a little nettled at her refusing to notice me in my distress, which is the very time one most wants notice.</p><p>Stubbs is not an uncommon name; and though I saw MRS. STUBBS on a little bright brass plate in Duke-street, and delivered so many letters to the lodgers in her house, I never thought of asking who she was, or whether she was my relation or not.</p><p>One day the young woman who took in the letters had not got change, and she called her mistress:—an old lady in a pope bonnet, came out of the parlor, and put on her spectacles, and looked at the letter, and fumbled in her pocket for eightpence, and apologized to the postman for keeping him waiting; and when I said, "Never mind, ma’am, it’s no trouble," the old lady gave a start, and then she pulled off her spectacles, and staggered back; and then she gave a great screech, and flung herself into my arms, and roared out, "MY SON, MY SON!"</p><p>"Law, mamma," said I, "is that you?" and I sat down on the hall bench with her, and let her kiss me as much as ever she liked. Hearing the whining and crying, down comes another lady from up the stairs,—it was my sister Eliza; and down came the lodgers. And the maid gets water and what not, and I was the regular hero of the group. I could not stay long then, having my letters to deliver. But, in the evening, after mail-time, I went back to my mamma and sister; and, over a bottle of prime old Port, and a precious good leg of boiled mutton and turnips, made myself pretty comfortable, I can tell you.</p><h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mamma had kept the house in Duke Street for more than two years. I recollected some of the chairs and tables from dear old Squiggle, and the bowl in which I had made that famous rum-punch, the evening she went away, which she and my sisters left untouched, and I was obliged to drink after they were gone; but that's not to the purpose.</p><p>Think of my sister Mary's luck! That chap, Waters, fell in love with her, and married her; and she now keeps her carriage, and lives in state near Squiggle. I offered to make it up with Waters; but he bears malice, and never will see or speak to me. He had the impudence, too, to say, that he took in all letters for mamma at Squiggle; and that as mine were all begging letters, he burned them, and never said a word to her concerning them. He allowed mamma fifty pounds a year, and, if she were not such a fool, she might have had three times as much; but the old lady was high and mighty forsooth, and would not be beholden, even to her own daughter, for more than she actually wanted. Even this fifty pounds she was going to refuse; but when I came to live with her, of course I wanted pocket money as well as board and lodging, and so I had the fifty pounds for <i>my</i> share, and eked out with it as well as I could.</p><p>Old Bates and the Captain, between them, gave mamma a hundred pounds when she left me (she had the deuce's own luck, to be sure—much more than ever fell to <i>me</i>, I know) and as she said she <i>would</i> try and work for her living, it was thought best to take a house and let lodgings, which she did. Our first and second floor paid us four guineas a week, on an average; and the front parlor and attic made forty pounds more. Mamma and Eliza used to have the front attic: but <i>I</i> took that, and they slept in the servants' room. Lizzy had a pretty genius for work, and earned a guinea a week that way; so that we had got nearly two hundred a year over the rent to keep house with,—and we got on pretty well. Besides, women eat nothing; my women didn't care for meat for days together sometimes,—so that it was only necessary to dress a good steak or so for me.</p><p>I'd lived in this way for five years or more, making myself content with my fifty pounds a year (<i>perhaps</i>, I’d saved a little out of it; but that's neither here nor there). From year's end to year's end I remained faithful to my dear mamma, never leaving her except for a month or so in the summer—when a bachelor may take a trip to Gravesend or Margate, which would be too expensive for a family. I say a bachelor, for the fact is, I don't know whether I am married or not—never having heard a word since of the scoundrelly Mrs. Stubbs.</p><p>How fond she was of me, to be sure! Being sociable myself, and loving to have my friends about me, we often used to assemble a company of as hearty fellows as you would wish to sit down with, and keep the nights up royally. "Never mind, my boys," I used to say. "Send the bottle round: mammy pays for all." as she did, sure enough; and sure enough we punished her cellar too. The good old lady used to wait upon us, as if for all the world she had been my servant, instead of a lady and my mamma. Never used she to repine, though I often, as I must confess, gave her occasion (keeping her up till four o'clock in the morning, because she never could sleep until she saw her "dear Bob" in bed, and leading her a sad anxious life). She was of such a sweet temper, the old lady, that I think in the course of five years I never knew her in a passion, except twice: and then with sister Lizzy, who declared I was ruining the house, and driving the lodgers away, one by one. But mamma would not hear of such envious spite on my sister’s part. "Her Bob," was always right, she said. At last Lizzy fairly retreated, and went to the Waters's. I was glad of it, for her temper was dreadful, and we used to be squabbling from morning till night.</p><p>Ah, those <i>were</i> jolly times! but ma was obliged to give up the lodging-house at last—for, somehow, things went wrong after my sister's departure—the nasty uncharitable people said, on account of <i>me</i>; because I drove away the lodgers by smoking and drinking, and kicking up noises in the house; and because ma gave me so much of her money:—so she did, but if she <i>would</i> give it, you know, how could I help it? Heigho! I wish I'd <i>kept</i> it.</p><p>No such luck. The business I thought was to last for ever; but at the end of two years a smash came—shut up shop—sell off every thing. Mamma went to the Waters's; and, will you believe it? the ungrateful wretches would not receive me! that Mary, you see, was <i>so</i> disappointed at not marrying me. Twenty pounds a year they allow, it is true: but what's that for a gentleman? For twenty years I have been struggling manfully to gain an honest livelihood, and, in the course of them, have seen a deal of life, to be sure. I've sold segars and pocket handkerchiefs at the corners of streets; I've been a billiard-marker; I've been Director (in the panic year) of the Imperial British Consolidated Mangle and Drying Ground Company. I've been on the stage (for two years an actor, and about a month as a cad, when I was very low); I've been the means of giving to the police of this empire some very valuable information (about licensed victuallers, gentlemen's carts, and pawnbrokers' names); I've been very nearly an officer again—that is, an assistant to an officer of the sheriff of Middlesex: it was my last place.</p><p>How I did rage and swear at him when I got out in the street! There stood he, the hideous Jew monster, at the double door, writhing under the effect of my language. I had my revenge! Heads were thrust out of every bar of his windows, laughing at him. A crowd gathered round me, as I stood pounding him with my satire, and they evidently enjoyed his discomfiture. I think the mob would have pelted the ruffian to death (one or two of their missiles hit <i>me</i>, I can tell you), when a policeman came up, and, in reply to a gentleman, who was asking what was the disturbance, said, "Bless you, Sir, it's Lord Cornwallis." "Move on, <i>Boots</i>," said the fellow to me, for the fact is, my misfortunes and early life are pretty well known—and so the crowd dispersed. "What could have made that policeman call you Lord Cornwallis and Boots?" said the gentleman, who seemed mightily amused, and had followed me. "Sir," said I, "I am an unfortunate officer of the North Bungay Fencibles, and I’ll tell you willingly for a pint of beer." He told me to follow him to his chambers at the Temple, which I did (a five pair back), and there, sure enough, I had the beer; and told him this very story you’ve been reading. You see he is what is called a literary man—and sold my adventures for me to the booksellers: he’s a strange chap; and says they're <i>moral</i>.</p><p>I’m blest if <i>I</i> can see any thing moral in them. I'm sure I ought to have been more lucky through life, being so very wide awake. And yet here I am, without a place, or even a friend, starving upon a beggarly twenty pounds a year—not a single sixpence more, upon <i>my honor</i>.</p>

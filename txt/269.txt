<p>The evening light is broad and yellow,<br> Tender, the April chill.<br> You are many years late,<br> Yet I'm glad you are here.<br> <br> Sit down now, close to me,<br> And look with joyful eyes:<br> Here it is, the blue notebook -<br> Filled with my childhood poems.<br> <br> Forgive me that I lived in sorrow,<br> Rejoiced too little in the sun.<br> Forgive, forgive, that I mistook<br> Too many others for you.<br></p>

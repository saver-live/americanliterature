A curley headed kid with a sunshiny smile
Heard the roar of a plane as it sailed through the sky
To her playmates she said with a bright twinkling eyes
My daddy rides that ship in the sky!

My daddy rides that ship in the sky
My daddy rides that ship in the sky
Mama's not afraid so neither am I
My daddy rides that ship in the sky.

A pug nose kid then kicked up his heel
Said my daddy works in the iron and the steel
If you're not afraid well neither am I
My daddy keeps your daddy up there so high.

My daddy keeps your daddy up there so high
My daddy keeps your daddy up there so high
If you're not afraid then neither am I
'Cause my daddy keeps your daddy up there so high.

A freckle face girl pinched her toe in the sand
Says my daddy works at the place where they land
So you tell your mama don't be afraid
'Cause my dad'll bring your daddy back home again.

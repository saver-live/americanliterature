<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet as the tender fragrance that survives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When martyred flowers breathe out their little lives,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet as a song that once consoled our pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never will be sung to us again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is thy remembrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the hour of rest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath come to thee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep, darling; it is best.

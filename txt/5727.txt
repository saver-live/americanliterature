<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAIDEN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O weathercock on the village spire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your golden feathers all on fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, what can you see from your perch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above there over the tower of the church?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WEATHERCOCK.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see the roofs and the streets below,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people moving to and fro,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beyond, without either roof or street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great salt sea, and the fisherman's fleet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see a ship come sailing in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the headlands and harbor of Lynn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a young man standing on the deck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a silken kerchief round his neck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he is pressing it to his lips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he is kissing his finger-tips,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he is lifting and waving his hand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blowing the kisses toward the land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAIDEN.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, that is the ship from over the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is bringing my lover back to me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing my lover so fond and true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who does not change with the wind like you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WEATHERCOCK.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I change with all the winds that blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only because they made me so,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And people would think it wondrous strange,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I, a Weathercock, should not change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O pretty Maiden, so fine and fair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your dreamy eyes and your golden hair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you and your lover meet to-day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will thank me for looking some other way.

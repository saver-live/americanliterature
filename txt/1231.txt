<pre>I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead! One of them shot by the sea in the east,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of them shot in the west by the sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead! both my boys! When you sit at the feast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are wanting a great song for Italy free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let none look at me!

II.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I was a poetess only last year,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And good at my art, for a woman, men said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this woman, this, who is agonized here,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever instead.

III.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What art can a woman be good at? Oh, vain!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What art is she good at, but hurting her breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah boys, how you hurt! you were strong as you pressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I proud, by that test.

IV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What art's for a woman? To hold on her knees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both darlings! to feel all their arms round her throat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cling, strangle a little! to sew by degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'broider the long-clothes and neat little coat;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dream and to doat.

V.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To teach them ... It stings there! I made them indeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak plain the word country. I taught them, no doubt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a country's a thing men should die for at need.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prated of liberty, rights, and about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tyrant cast out.

VI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when their eyes flashed... O my beautiful eyes!...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I exulted; nay, let them go forth at the wheels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the guns, and denied not. But then the surprise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one sits quite alone! Then one weeps, then one kneels!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, how the house feels!

VII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, happy news came, in gay letters moiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my kisses, of camp-life and glory, and how
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both loved me; and, soon coming home to be spoiled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In return would fan off every fly from my brow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their green laurel-bough.

VIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then was triumph at Turin: Ancona was free!'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some one came out of the cheers in the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a face pale as stone, to say something to me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Guido was dead! I fell down at his feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they cheered in the street.

IX.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bore it; friends soothed me; my grief looked sublime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ransom of Italy. One boy remained
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be leant on and walked with, recalling the time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the height he had gained.

X.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And letters still came, shorter, sadder, more strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ now but in one hand, I was not to faint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One loved me for two, would be with me ere long:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Viva l' Italia! he died for, our saint,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who forbids our complaint."

XI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Nanni would add, he was safe, and aware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a presence that turned off the balls, was imprest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how 'twas impossible, quite dispossessed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live on for the rest."

XII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which, without pause, up the telegraph line
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta: Shot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell his mother. Ah, ah, his, 'their' mother, not mine,'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No voice says "My mother" again to me. What!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think Guido forgot?

XIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think not. Themselves were too lately forgiven
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through that Love and Sorrow which reconciled so
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Above and Below.

XIV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Christ of the five wounds, who look'dst through the dark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the face of Thy mother! consider, I pray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we common mothers stand desolate, mark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no last word to say!

XV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both boys dead? but that's out of nature. We all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to a wall;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when Italy's made, for what end is it done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have not a son?

XVI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ah, ah! when Gaeta's taken, what then?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sport
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the guns of Cavalli with final retort
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have cut the game short?

XVII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your flag takes all heaven for its white, green, and red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have your country from mountain to sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And I have my Dead)

XVIII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then? Do not mock me. Ah, ring your bells low,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burn your lights faintly! My country is there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Italy's there, with my brave civic Pair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To disfranchise despair!

XIX.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me. Some women bear children in strength,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bite back the cry of their pain in self-scorn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at length
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into wail such as this and we sit on forlorn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the man-child is born.

XX.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead! One of them shot by the sea in the east,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of them shot in the west by the sea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both! both my boys! If in keeping the feast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want a great song for your Italy free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let none look at me!

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek not what his soul desires.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dreads not what my spirit fears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Heavens have shown us separate fires.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our dooms have dealt us differing years.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our daysprings and our timeless dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordained for us and still control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives sundered at the fountain-head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And distant, now, as Pole from Pole.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, dwelling thus, these worlds apart,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we encounter each is free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bare that larger, liberal heart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our kin and neighbours seldom see.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Custom and code compared in jest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weakness delivered without shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certain common sins confessed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which all men know, and none dare blame.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Een so it is, and well content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be so a moments space,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each finds the other excellent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, runs to follow his own race!

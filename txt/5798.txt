<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long, sleepless watches of the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle face--the face of one long dead--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks at me from the wall, where round its head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in this room she died; and soul more white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never through martyrdom of fire was led
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To its repose; nor can in books be read
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of a life more benedight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mountain in the distant West
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays a cross of snow upon its side.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the cross I wear upon my breast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seasons, changeless since the day she died.

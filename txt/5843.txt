<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon Iceland's solitary strand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poet wandered with his book and pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking some final word, some sweet Amen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith to close the volume in his hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The billows rolled and plunged upon the sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circling sea-gulls swept beyond his ken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the parting cloud-rack now and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashed the red sunset over sea and land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then by the billows at his feet was tossed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broken oar; and carved thereon he read,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oft was I weary, when I toiled at thee";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like a man, who findeth what was lost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote the words, then lifted up his head,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flung his useless pen into the sea.

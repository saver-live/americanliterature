<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here lies the gentle humorist, who died
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bright Indian Summer of his fame!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple stone, with but a date and name,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marks his secluded resting-place beside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river that he loved and glorified.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in the autumn of his days he came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dry leaves of life were all aflame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tints that brightened and were multiplied.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sweet a life was his; how sweet a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living, to wing with mirth the weary hours,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or with romantic tales the heart to cheer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying, to leave a memory like the breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of summers full of sunshine and of showers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grief and gladness in the atmosphere.

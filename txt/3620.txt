<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winds out of the west land blow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends have breathed them there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm with the blood of lads I know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes east the sighing air.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It fanned their temples, filled their lungs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered their forelocks free;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends made words of it with tongues
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That talk no more to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their voices, dying as they fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick on the wind are sown;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of men blow soundless by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fellows' and my own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh lads, at home I heard you plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here your speech is still,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the sighing wind in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hollo from the hill.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and I, we both were there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But neither long abode;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now through the friendless world we fare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sigh upon the road.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though to my feathers in the wet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stood here from break of day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not found a thing to eat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For only rubbish comes my way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I to live on lebeen-lone?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muttered the old crane of Gort.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all my pains on lebeen-lone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Guari walked amid his court
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace-yard and river-side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there to three old beggars said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You that have wandered far and wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can ravel out whats in my head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do men who least desire get most,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or get the most who most desire?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beggar said: They get the most
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom man or devil cannot tire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what could make their muscles taut
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless desire had made them so.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Guari laughed with secret thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that be true as it seems true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of you three is a rich man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he shall have a thousand pounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is first asleep, if but he can
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep before the third noon sounds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereon merry as a bird,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his old thoughts King Guari went
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From river-side and palace-yard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left them to their argument.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I win, one beggar said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I am old I shall persuade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty girl to share my bed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second: I shall learn a trade;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third: Ill hurry to the course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the other gentlemen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lay it all upon a horse;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second: I have thought again:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A farmer has more dignity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One to another sighed and cried:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exorbitant dreams of beggary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That idleness had borne to pride,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang through their teeth from noon to noon;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the second twilight brought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frenzy of the beggars moon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They closed their blood-shot eyes for naught.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One beggar cried: Youre shamming sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereupon their anger grew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they were whirling in a heap.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theyd mauled and bitten the night through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sat upon their heels to rail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when old Guari came and stood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the three to end this tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were commingling lice and blood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times up, he cried, and all the three
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With blood-shot eyes upon him stared.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times up, he cried, and all the three
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell down upon the dust and snored.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I shall be lucky yet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they are silent, said the crane.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though to my feathers in the wet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive stood as I were made of stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seen the rubbish run about,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its certain there are trout somewhere
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And maybe I shall take a trout
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If but I do not seem to care.

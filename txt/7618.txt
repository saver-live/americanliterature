<p> When the gong sounds ten in the morning and I walk to school by our lane,<br> Every day I meet the hawker crying, "Bangles, crystal bangles!"<br> There is nothing to hurry him on, there is no road he must take, no place he must go to, no time when he must come home.<br> I wish I were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying, "Bangles, crystal bangles!"<br> When at four in the afternoon I come back from the school,<br> I can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging the ground.<br> He does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes with dust, nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or gets wet.<br> I wish I were a gardener digging away at the garden with nobody to stop me from digging.<br> Just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to bed,<br> I can see through my open window the watchman walking up and down.<br> The lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands like a giant with one red eye in its head.<br> The watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at his side, and never once goes to bed in his life.<br> I wish I were a watchman walking the streets all night, chasing the shadows with my lantern.</p>

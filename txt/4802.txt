<pre>And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same . . . .

And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six ranches that proceed out of the candlestick . . . . Their knops and their branches shall be of the same. - Exodus.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know this, my brethren, Heaven! clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the clouds are gone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proper Sort shall flourish now,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good times are coming on,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil that was threatened late
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all of our degree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath passed in discord and debate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Hey then up go we!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common people strove in vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shame us unto toil,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are spent and we remain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we shall share the spoil
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to our several needs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Beauty shall decree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Age ordains or Birth concedes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Hey then up go we!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they that with accursèd zeal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Service would amend,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall own the odds and come to heel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere worse befall their end:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For though no naked word be wrote
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet plainly shall they see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What pinneth Orders to their coat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Hey then up go we!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our doorways that, in time of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We opened overwide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall softly close from year to year
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all be purified;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For though no fluttering fan be heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor chaff be seen to flee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord shall winnow the Lords Preferred,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Hey then up go we!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our altars which the heathen brake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall rankly smoke anew,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And anise mint, and cummin take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their dread and sovereign due,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereby the buttons of our trade
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall all restorèd be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With curious work in gilt and braid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Hey then up go we!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then come, my brethren, and prepare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candlesticks and bells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scarlet, brass, and badgers hair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein our Honour dwells,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straitly fence and strictly keep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arks integrity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Armageddon break our sleep . . .
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Hey then up go we!

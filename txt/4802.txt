<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Priest at Philæ,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tongue-tied, feeble, and old;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the daily prayer to the Virgin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was all the Office he could.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others were ill-remembered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mumbled and hard to hear;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to Mary, the two-fold Virgin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always his voice rang clear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the congregation mocked him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the weight of the years he bore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they sent word to the Bishop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he should not serve them more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Never again at the Offering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bread and the Body are one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, never the picture of Mary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching him serve her Son!)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly and wise was the Bishop.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the Priest said he:,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience till thou art stronger,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep meantime with me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience a little; it may be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord shall loosen thy tongue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then thou shalt serve at the Offering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it was when we were young.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Priest obeyed and was silent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Bishop gave him leave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To walk alone in the desert
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where none should see him grieve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Never again at the Offering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Wine and the Blood are one!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, never the picture of Mary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching him honour her Son!)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saintly and clean was the Bishop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruling himself aright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With prayer and fast in the daytime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scourge and vigil at night.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of his zeal he was minded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add one penance the more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A garment of harshest sackcloth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the robes he wore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gathered the cloth in secret
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest any should know and praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shears, the palm and the packthread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laboured it many ways.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he had no skill in the making,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And failed and fretted the while;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till there stood a Woman before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling as Mothers smile.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her feet were burned by the desert,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a desert-dweller she trod,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the two-fold Virgin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spouse and Bearer of God!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the shears and the sacking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The needle and stubborn thread,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cut, she shaped, and she sewed them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, This shall be blessed, she said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She passed in the white hot noontide,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a wave of the quivering air;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Bishops eyes were opened,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he fell on his face in prayer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, far from the smouldering censers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the chanted praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, far from the pictures of Mary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had watched him all his days,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in the desert by Philæ,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Priest walked forlorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he saw at the head of her Riders
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Queen of the Desert-born.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High she swayed on her camel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful to behold:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her beast was belled with silver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her veils were spotted with gold!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low she leaned from her litter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft she spoke in his ear:,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, I have watched thy sorrow!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, but the end is near!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For again thou shalt serve at the Offering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy tongue shall be loosed in praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again thou shalt sing unto Mary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has watched thee all thy days.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go in peace to the Bishop,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carry him word from me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Woman who sewed the sackcloth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would have him set thee free!

I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough! we're tired, my heart and I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sit beside the headstone thus,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wish that name were carved for us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moss reprints more tenderly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard types of the mason's knife,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As heaven's sweet life renews earth's life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With which we're tired, my heart and I.

II.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see we're tired, my heart and I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We dealt with books, we trusted men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in our own blood drenched the pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if such colours could not fly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked too straight for fortune's end,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We loved too true to keep a friend;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last we're tired, my heart and I.

III.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How tired we feel, my heart and I!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem of no use in the world;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fancies hang grey and uncurled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About men's eyes indifferently;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our voice which thrilled you so, will let
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sleep; our tears are only wet:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we here, my heart and I?

IV.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tired, so tired, my heart and I!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not thus in that old time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ralph sat with me 'neath the lime
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch the sunset from the sky.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear love, you're looking tired,' he said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, smiling at him, shook my head:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis now we're tired, my heart and I.

V.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tired, so tired, my heart and I!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though now none takes me on his arm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fold me close and kiss me warm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till each quick breath end in a sigh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of happy languor. Now, alone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lean upon this graveyard stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncheered, unkissed, my heart and I.

VI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired out we are, my heart and I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose the world brought diadems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tempt us, crusted with loose gems
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of powers and pleasures? Let it try.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We scarcely care to look at even
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty child, or God's blue heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel so tired, my heart and I.

VII.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet who complains? My heart and I?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this abundant earth no doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is little room for things worn out:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disdain them, break them, throw them by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if before the days grew rough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We once were loved, used, well enough,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, we've fared, my heart and I.

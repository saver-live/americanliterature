<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's riches to him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has made a great peacock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the pride of his eye?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind-beaten, stone-grey,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And desolate Three-rock
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would nourish his whim.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live he or die
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid wet rocks and heather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ghost will be gay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding feather to feather
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the pride of his eye.

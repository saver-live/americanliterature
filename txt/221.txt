<p>For the last time, we met,<br> On the embankment, as ever.<br> High water in the Neva,<br> Fear of flood in the city.<br> <br> He talked of the summer and said,<br> How absurd – a woman poet!<br> I remember the Tsar's great palace,<br> The Peter and Paul fortress! –<br> <br> Then, the air was not ours,<br> But a gift from heaven – wondrous.<br> And I, in that moment, was granted,<br> The latest of all my mad songs.<br></p>

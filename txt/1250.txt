<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Saviour looked on Peter. Ay, no word,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No gesture of reproach; the Heavens serene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though heavy with armed justice, did not lean
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their thunders that way: the forsaken Lord
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked only, on the traitor. None record
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that look was, none guess; for those who have seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wronged lovers loving through a death-pang keen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or pale-cheeked martyrs smiling to a sword,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have missed Jehovah at the judgment-call.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Peter, from the height of blasphemy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I never knew this man' did quail and fall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As knowing straight that God; and turned free
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went out speechless from the face of all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled the silence, weeping bitterly.
</pre>

<p><cite class="al-title">The Machine Stops</cite> is considered Forster's masterwork of <a href="/dystopian-stories">Dystopian short fiction</a>, a cautionary tale for all of us who can no longer imagine a world without the Internet and smartphones. It was first published in 1909 in the <cite class="al-periodical">Oxford and Cambridge Review</cite>. Though considered a short story, we've featured it here as a novella since it has three distinct parts.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman singeth at her spinning-wheel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasant chant, ballad or barcarole;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinketh of her song, upon the whole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far more than of her flax; and yet the reel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is full, and artfully her fingers feel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With quick adjustment, provident control,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines, too subtly twisted to unroll
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out to a perfect thread. I hence appeal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the dear Christian Church, that we may do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Father's business in these temples mirk,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus swift and steadfast, thus intent and strong;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While thus, apart from toil, our souls pursue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some high calm spheric tune, and prove our work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better for the sweetness of our song.

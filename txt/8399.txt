<h2>Chapter 1</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> TOM SEEKS NEW ADVENTURES</p><p> DO you reckon Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all them adventures? I meanthe adventures we had down the river, and the time we set the darky Jimfree and Tom got shot in the leg. No, he wasn't. It only just p'isonedhim for more. That was all the effect it had. You see, when we three cameback up the river in glory, as you may say, from that long travel, andthe village received us with a torchlight procession and speeches, andeverybody hurrah'd and shouted, it made us heroes, and that was what TomSawyer had always been hankering to be.</p><p> For a while he WAS satisfied. Everybody made much of him, and he tiltedup his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it. Somecalled him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up fit tobust. You see he laid over me and Jim considerable, because we only wentdown the river on a raft and came back by the steamboat, but Tom went bythe steamboat both ways. The boys envied me and Jim a good deal, butland! they just knuckled to the dirt before TOM.</p><p> Well, I don't know; maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadn't beenfor old Nat Parsons, which was postmaster, and powerful long and slim,and kind o' good-hearted and silly, and bald-headed, on account of hisage, and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see. For as much as thirtyyears he'd been the only man in the village that had a reputation--I meana reputation for being a traveler, and of course he was mortal proud ofit, and it was reckoned that in the course of that thirty years he hadtold about that journey over a million times and enjoyed it every time.And now comes along a boy not quite fifteen, and sets everybody admiringand gawking over HIS travels, and it just give the poor old man the highstrikes. It made him sick to listen to Tom, and to hear the people say"My land!" "Did you ever!" "My goodness sakes alive!" and all suchthings; but he couldn't pull away from it, any more than a fly that's gotits hind leg fast in the molasses. And always when Tom come to a rest,the poor old cretur would chip in on HIS same old travels and work themfor all they were worth; but they were pretty faded, and didn't go formuch, and it was pitiful to see. And then Tom would take another innings,and then the old man again--and so on, and so on, for an hour and more,each trying to beat out the other.</p><p> You see, Parsons' travels happened like this: When he first got to bepostmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter forsomebody he didn't know, and there wasn't any such person in the village.Well, he didn't know what to do, nor how to act, and there the letterstayed and stayed, week in and week out, till the bare sight of it gavehim a conniption. The postage wasn't paid on it, and that was anotherthing to worry about. There wasn't any way to collect that ten cents, andhe reckon'd the gov'ment would hold him responsible for it and maybe turnhim out besides, when they found he hadn't collected it. Well, at last hecouldn't stand it any longer. He couldn't sleep nights, he couldn't eat,he was thinned down to a shadder, yet he da'sn't ask anybody's advice,for the very person he asked for advice might go back on him and let thegov'ment know about the letter. He had the letter buried under the floor,but that did no good; if he happened to see a person standing over theplace it'd give him the cold shivers, and loaded him up with suspicions,and he would sit up that night till the town was still and dark, and thenhe would sneak there and get it out and bury it in another place. Ofcourse, people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads andwhispering, because, the way he was looking and acting, they judged hehad killed somebody or done something terrible, they didn't know what,and if he had been a stranger they would've lynched him.</p><p> Well, as I was saying, it got so he couldn't stand it any longer; so hemade up his mind to pull out for Washington, and just go to the Presidentof the United States and make a clean breast of the whole thing, notkeeping back an atom, and then fetch the letter out and lay it before thewhole gov'ment, and say, "Now, there she is--do with me what you're amind to; though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man and notdeserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind me a familythat must starve and yet hadn't had a thing to do with it, which is thewhole truth and I can swear to it."</p><p> So he did it. He had a little wee bit of steamboating, and somestage-coaching, but all the rest of the way was horseback, and it tookhim three weeks to get to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots ofvillages and four cities. He was gone 'most eight weeks, and there neverwas such a proud man in the village as he when he got back. His travelsmade him the greatest man in all that region, and the most talked about;and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country, andfrom over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at him--and therethey'd stand and gawk, and he'd gabble. You never see anything like it.</p><p> Well, there wasn't any way now to settle which was the greatest traveler;some said it was Nat, some said it was Tom. Everybody allowed that Nathad seen the most longitude, but they had to give in that whatever Tomwas short in longitude he had made up in latitude and climate. It wasabout a stand-off; so both of them had to whoop up their dangerousadventures, and try to get ahead THAT way. That bullet-wound in Tom's legwas a tough thing for Nat Parsons to buck against, but he bucked the besthe could; and at a disadvantage, too, for Tom didn't set still as he'dorter done, to be fair, but always got up and sauntered around and workedhis limp while Nat was painting up the adventure that HE had inWashington; for Tom never let go that limp when his leg got well, butpracticed it nights at home, and kept it good as new right along.</p><p> Nat's adventure was like this; I don't know how true it is; maybe he gotit out of a paper, or somewhere, but I will say this for him, that he DIDknow how to tell it. He could make anybody's flesh crawl, and he'd turnpale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women and girlsgot so faint they couldn't stick it out. Well, it was this way, as nearas I can remember:</p><p> He come a-loping into Washington, and put up his horse and shoved out tothe President's house with his letter, and they told him the Presidentwas up to the Capitol, and just going to start for Philadelphia--not aminute to lose if he wanted to catch him. Nat 'most dropped, it made himso sick. His horse was put up, and he didn't know what to do. But justthen along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack, and he see hischance. He rushes out and shouts: "A half a dollar if you git me to theCapitol in half an hour, and a quarter extra if you do it in twentyminutes!"</p><p> "Done!" says the darky.</p><p> Nat he jumped in and slammed the door, and away they went a-ripping anda-tearing over the roughest road a body ever see, and the racket of itwas something awful. Nat passed his arms through the loops and hung onfor life and death, but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up inthe air, and the bottom fell out, and when it come down Nat's feet was onthe ground, and he see he was in the most desperate danger if he couldn'tkeep up with the hack. He was horrible scared, but he laid into his workfor all he was worth, and hung tight to the arm-loops and made his legsfairly fly. He yelled and shouted to the driver to stop, and so did thecrowds along the street, for they could see his legs spinning along underthe coach, and his head and shoulders bobbing inside through the windows,and he was in awful danger; but the more they all shouted the more thenigger whooped and yelled and lashed the horses and shouted, "Don't youfret, I'se gwine to git you dah in time, boss; I's gwine to do it, sho'!"for you see he thought they were all hurrying him up, and, of course, hecouldn't hear anything for the racket he was making. And so they wentripping along, and everybody just petrified to see it; and when they gotto the Capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever was made, andeverybody said so. The horses laid down, and Nat dropped, all tuckeredout, and he was all dust and rags and barefooted; but he was in time andjust in time, and caught the President and give him the letter, andeverything was all right, and the President give him a free pardon on thespot, and Nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of one, becausehe could see that if he hadn't had the hack he wouldn't'a' got there intime, nor anywhere near it.</p><p> It WAS a powerful good adventure, and Tom Sawyer had to work hisbullet-wound mighty lively to hold his own against it.</p><p> Well, by and by Tom's glory got to paling down gradu'ly, on account ofother things turning up for the people to talk about--first a horse-race,and on top of that a house afire, and on top of that the circus, and ontop of that the eclipse; and that started a revival, same as it alwaysdoes, and by that time there wasn't any more talk about Tom, so to speak,and you never see a person so sick and disgusted.</p><p> Pretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and dayout, and when I asked him what WAS he in such a state about, he said it'most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away, and himgetting older and older, and no wars breaking out and no way of making aname for himself that he could see. Now that is the way boys is alwaysthinking, but he was the first one I ever heard come out and say it.</p><p> So then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated; andpretty soon he struck it, and offered to take me and Jim in. Tom Sawyerwas always free and generous that way. There's a-plenty of boys that'smighty good and friendly when YOU'VE got a good thing, but when a goodthing happens to come their way they don't say a word to you, and try tohog it all. That warn't ever Tom Sawyer's way, I can say that for him.There's plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around youwhen you've got an apple and beg the core off of you; but when they'vegot one, and you beg for the core and remind them how you give them acore one time, they say thank you 'most to death, but there ain't a-goingto be no core. But I notice they always git come up with; all you got todo is to wait.</p><p> Well, we went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us what it was.It was a crusade.</p><p> "What's a crusade?" I says.</p><p> He looked scornful, the way he's always done when he was ashamed of aperson, and says:</p><p> "Huck Finn, do you mean to tell me you don't know what a crusade is?"</p><p> "No," says I, "I don't. And I don't care to, nuther. I've lived till nowand done without it, and had my health, too. But as soon as you tell me,I'll know, and that's soon enough. I don't see any use in finding outthings and clogging up my head with them when I mayn't ever have anyoccasion to use 'em. There was Lance Williams, he learned how to talkChoctaw here till one come and dug his grave for him. Now, then, what's acrusade? But I can tell you one thing before you begin; if it's apatent-right, there's no money in it. Bill Thompson he--"</p><p> "Patent-right!" says he. "I never see such an idiot. Why, a crusade is akind of war."</p><p> I thought he must be losing his mind. But no, he was in real earnest, andwent right on, perfectly ca'm.</p><p> "A crusade is a war to recover the Holy Land from the paynim."</p><p> "Which Holy Land?"</p><p> "Why, the Holy Land--there ain't but one."</p><p> "What do we want of it?"</p><p> "Why, can't you understand? It's in the hands of the paynim, and it's ourduty to take it away from them."</p><p> "How did we come to let them git hold of it?"</p><p> "We didn't come to let them git hold of it. They always had it."</p><p> "Why, Tom, then it must belong to them, don't it?"</p><p> "Why of course it does. Who said it didn't?"</p><p> I studied over it, but couldn't seem to git at the right of it, no way. Isays:</p><p> "It's too many for me, Tom Sawyer. If I had a farm and it was mine, andanother person wanted it, would it be right for him to--"</p><p> "Oh, shucks! you don't know enough to come in when it rains, Huck Finn.It ain't a farm, it's entirely different. You see, it's like this. Theyown the land, just the mere land, and that's all they DO own; but it wasour folks, our Jews and Christians, that made it holy, and so theyhaven't any business to be there defiling it. It's a shame, and we oughtnot to stand it a minute. We ought to march against them and take it awayfrom them."</p><p> "Why, it does seem to me it's the most mixed-up thing I ever see! Now, ifI had a farm and another person--"</p><p> "Don't I tell you it hasn't got anything to do with farming? Farming isbusiness, just common low-down business: that's all it is, it's all youcan say for it; but this is higher, this is religious, and totallydifferent."</p><p> "Religious to go and take the land away from people that owns it?"</p><p> "Certainly; it's always been considered so."</p><p> Jim he shook his head, and says:</p><p> "Mars Tom, I reckon dey's a mistake about it somers--dey mos' sholy is.I's religious myself, en I knows plenty religious people, but I hain'trun across none dat acts like dat."</p><p> It made Tom hot, and he says:</p><p> "Well, it's enough to make a body sick, such mullet-headed ignorance! Ifeither of you'd read anything about history, you'd know that Richard Curde Loon, and the Pope, and Godfrey de Bulleyn, and lots more of the mostnoble-hearted and pious people in the world, hacked and hammered at thepaynims for more than two hundred years trying to take their land awayfrom them, and swum neck-deep in blood the whole time--and yet here's acouple of sap-headed country yahoos out in the backwoods of Missourisetting themselves up to know more about the rights and wrongs of it thanthey did! Talk about cheek!"</p><p> Well, of course, that put a more different light on it, and me and Jimfelt pretty cheap and ignorant, and wished we hadn't been quite sochipper. I couldn't say nothing, and Jim he couldn't for a while; then hesays:</p><p> "Well, den, I reckon it's all right; beca'se ef dey didn't know, deyain't no use for po' ignorant folks like us to be trying to know; en so,ef it's our duty, we got to go en tackle it en do de bes' we can. Sametime, I feel as sorry for dem paynims as Mars Tom. De hard part gwine tobe to kill folks dat a body hain't been 'quainted wid and dat hain't donehim no harm. Dat's it, you see. Ef we wuz to go 'mongst 'em, jist wethree, en say we's hungry, en ast 'em for a bite to eat, why, maybe dey'sjist like yuther people. Don't you reckon dey is? Why, DEY'D give it, Iknow dey would, en den--"</p><p> "Then what?"</p><p> "Well, Mars Tom, my idea is like dis. It ain't no use, we CAN'T kill dempo' strangers dat ain't doin' us no harm, till we've had practice--Iknows it perfectly well, Mars Tom--'deed I knows it perfectly well. Butef we takes a' axe or two, jist you en me en Huck, en slips acrost deriver to-night arter de moon's gone down, en kills dat sick fam'ly dat'sover on the Sny, en burns dey house down, en--"</p><p> "Oh, you make me tired!" says Tom. "I don't want to argue any more withpeople like you and Huck Finn, that's always wandering from the subject,and ain't got any more sense than to try to reason out a thing that'spure theology by the laws that protect real estate!"</p><p> Now that's just where Tom Sawyer warn't fair. Jim didn't mean no harm,and I didn't mean no harm. We knowed well enough that he was right and wewas wrong, and all we was after was to get at the HOW of it, and that wasall; and the only reason he couldn't explain it so we could understand itwas because we was ignorant--yes, and pretty dull, too, I ain't denyingthat; but, land! that ain't no crime, I should think.</p><p> But he wouldn't hear no more about it--just said if we had tackled thething in the proper spirit, he would 'a' raised a couple of thousandknights and put them in steel armor from head to heel, and made me alieutenant and Jim a sutler, and took the command himself and brushed thewhole paynim outfit into the sea like flies and come back across theworld in a glory like sunset. But he said we didn't know enough to takethe chance when we had it, and he wouldn't ever offer it again. And hedidn't. When he once got set, you couldn't budge him.</p><p> But I didn't care much. I am peaceable, and don't get up rows with peoplethat ain't doing nothing to me. I allowed if the paynim was satisfied Iwas, and we would let it stand at that.</p><p> Now Tom he got all that notion out of Walter Scott's book, which he wasalways reading. And it WAS a wild notion, because in my opinion he nevercould've raised the men, and if he did, as like as not he would've gotlicked. I took the book and read all about it, and as near as I couldmake it out, most of the folks that shook farming to go crusading had amighty rocky time of it.</p><h2>Chapter 2</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> THE BALLOON ASCENSION </p><p><img alt="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 2" title="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 2" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/tom-sawyer-abroad/chpt-2.jpg" style="max-width:600px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="4167974078" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> WELL, Tom got up one thing after another, but they all had tender spotsabout 'em somewheres, and he had to shove 'em aside. So at last he wasabout in despair. Then the St. Louis papers begun to talk a good dealabout the balloon that was going to sail to Europe, and Tom sort ofthought he wanted to go down and see what it looked like, but couldn'tmake up his mind. But the papers went on talking, and so he allowed thatmaybe if he didn't go he mightn't ever have another chance to see aballoon; and next, he found out that Nat Parsons was going down to seeit, and that decided him, of course. He wasn't going to have Nat Parsonscoming back bragging about seeing the balloon, and him having to listento it and keep quiet. So he wanted me and Jim to go too, and we went.</p><p> It was a noble big balloon, and had wings and fans and all sorts ofthings, and wasn't like any balloon you see in pictures. It was away outtoward the edge of town, in a vacant lot, corner of Twelfth street; andthere was a big crowd around it, making fun of it, and making fun of theman,--a lean pale feller with that soft kind of moonlight in his eyes,you know,--and they kept saying it wouldn't go. It made him hot to hearthem, and he would turn on them and shake his fist and say they wasanimals and blind, but some day they would find they had stood face toface with one of the men that lifts up nations and makes civilizations,and was too dull to know it; and right here on this spot their ownchildren and grandchildren would build a monument to him that wouldoutlast a thousand years, but his name would outlast the monument. Andthen the crowd would burst out in a laugh again, and yell at him, and askhim what was his name before he was married, and what he would take tonot do it, and what was his sister's cat's grandmother's name, and allthe things that a crowd says when they've got hold of a feller that theysee they can plague. Well, some things they said WAS funny,--yes, andmighty witty too, I ain't denying that,--but all the same it warn't fairnor brave, all them people pitching on one, and they so glib and sharp,and him without any gift of talk to answer back with. But, good land!what did he want to sass back for? You see, it couldn't do him no good,and it was just nuts for them. They HAD him, you know. But that was hisway. I reckon he couldn't help it; he was made so, I judge. He was a goodenough sort of cretur, and hadn't no harm in him, and was just a genius,as the papers said, which wasn't his fault. We can't all be sound: we'vegot to be the way we're made. As near as I can make out, geniuses thinkthey know it all, and so they won't take people's advice, but always gotheir own way, which makes everybody forsake them and despise them, andthat is perfectly natural. If they was humbler, and listened and tried tolearn, it would be better for them.</p><p> The part the professor was in was like a boat, and was big and roomy, andhad water-tight lockers around the inside to keep all sorts of things in,and a body could sit on them, and make beds on them, too. We went aboard,and there was twenty people there, snooping around and examining, and oldNat Parsons was there, too. The professor kept fussing around gettingready, and the people went ashore, drifting out one at a time, and oldNat he was the last. Of course it wouldn't do to let him go out behindUS. We mustn't budge till he was gone, so we could be last ourselves.</p><p> But he was gone now, so it was time for us to follow. I heard a bigshout, and turned around--the city was dropping from under us like ashot! It made me sick all through, I was so scared. Jim turned gray andcouldn't say a word, and Tom didn't say nothing, but looked excited. Thecity went on dropping down, and down, and down; but we didn't seem to bedoing nothing but just hang in the air and stand still. The houses gotsmaller and smaller, and the city pulled itself together, closer andcloser, and the men and wagons got to looking like ants and bugs crawlingaround, and the streets like threads and cracks; and then it all kind ofmelted together, and there wasn't any city any more it was only a bigscar on the earth, and it seemed to me a body could see up the river anddown the river about a thousand miles, though of course it wasn't somuch. By and by the earth was a ball--just a round ball, of a dull color,with shiny stripes wriggling and winding around over it, which wasrivers. The Widder Douglas always told me the earth was round like aball, but I never took any stock in a lot of them superstitions o' hers,and of course I paid no attention to that one, because I could see myselfthat the world was the shape of a plate, and flat. I used to go up on thehill, and take a look around and prove it for myself, because I reckonthe best way to get a sure thing on a fact is to go and examine foryourself, and not take anybody's say-so. But I had to give in now thatthe widder was right. That is, she was right as to the rest of the world,but she warn't right about the part our village is in; that part is theshape of a plate, and flat, I take my oath!</p><p> The professor had been quiet all this time, as if he was asleep; but hebroke loose now, and he was mighty bitter. He says something like this:</p><p> "Idiots! They said it wouldn't go; and they wanted to examine it, and spyaround and get the secret of it out of me. But I beat them. Nobody knowsthe secret but me. Nobody knows what makes it move but me; and it's a newpower--a new power, and a thousand times the strongest in the earth!Steam's foolishness to it! They said I couldn't go to Europe. To Europe!Why, there's power aboard to last five years, and feed for three months.They are fools! What do they know about it? Yes, and they said myair-ship was flimsy. Why, she's good for fifty years! I can sail theskies all my life if I want to, and steer where I please, though theylaughed at that, and said I couldn't. Couldn't steer! Come here, boy;we'll see. You press these buttons as I tell you."</p><p> He made Tom steer the ship all about and every which way, and learnt himthe whole thing in nearly no time; and Tom said it was perfectly easy. Hemade him fetch the ship down 'most to the earth, and had him spin heralong so close to the Illinois prairies that a body could talk to thefarmers, and hear everything they said perfectly plain; and he flung outprinted bills to them that told about the balloon, and said it was goingto Europe. Tom got so he could steer straight for a tree till he gotnearly to it, and then dart up and skin right along over the top of it.Yes, and he showed Tom how to land her; and he done it first-rate, too,and set her down in the prairies as soft as wool. But the minute westarted to skip out the professor says, "No, you don't!" and shot her upin the air again. It was awful. I begun to beg, and so did Jim; but itonly give his temper a rise, and he begun to rage around and look wildout of his eyes, and I was scared of him.</p><p> Well, then he got on to his troubles again, and mourned and grumbledabout the way he was treated, and couldn't seem to git over it, andespecially people's saying his ship was flimsy. He scoffed at that, andat their saying she warn't simple and would be always getting out oforder. Get out of order! That graveled him; he said that she couldn't anymore get out of order than the solar sister.</p><p> He got worse and worse, and I never see a person take on so. It give methe cold shivers to see him, and so it did Jim. By and by he got toyelling and screaming, and then he swore the world shouldn't ever havehis secret at all now, it had treated him so mean. He said he would sailhis balloon around the globe just to show what he could do, and then hewould sink it in the sea, and sink us all along with it, too. Well, itwas the awfulest fix to be in, and here was night coming on!</p><p> He give us something to eat, and made us go to the other end of the boat,and he laid down on a locker, where he could boss all the works, and puthis old pepper-box revolver under his head, and said if anybody comefooling around there trying to land her, he would kill him.</p><p> We set scrunched up together, and thought considerable, but didn't saymuch--only just a word once in a while when a body had to say somethingor bust, we was so scared and worried. The night dragged along slow andlonesome. We was pretty low down, and the moonshine made everything softand pretty, and the farmhouses looked snug and homeful, and we could hearthe farm sounds, and wished we could be down there; but, laws! we justslipped along over them like a ghost, and never left a track.</p><p> Away in the night, when all the sounds was late sounds, and the air had alate feel, and a late smell, too--about a two-o'clock feel, as near as Icould make out--Tom said the professor was so quiet this time he must beasleep, and we'd better--</p><p> "Better what?" I says in a whisper, and feeling sick all over, because Iknowed what he was thinking about.</p><p> "Better slip back there and tie him, and land the ship," he says.</p><p> I says: "No, sir! Don' you budge, Tom Sawyer."</p><p> And Jim--well, Jim was kind o' gasping, he was so scared. He says:</p><p> "Oh, Mars Tom, DON'T! Ef you teches him, we's gone--we's gone sho'! Iain't gwine anear him, not for nothin' in dis worl'. Mars Tom, he's plumbcrazy."</p><p> Tom whispers and says--"That's WHY we've got to do something. If hewasn't crazy I wouldn't give shucks to be anywhere but here; you couldn'thire me to get out--now that I've got used to this balloon and over thescare of being cut loose from the solid ground--if he was in his rightmind. But it's no good politics, sailing around like this with a personthat's out of his head, and says he's going round the world and thendrown us all. We've GOT to do something, I tell you, and do it before hewakes up, too, or we mayn't ever get another chance. Come!"</p><p> But it made us turn cold and creepy just to think of it, and we said wewouldn't budge. So Tom was for slipping back there by himself to see ifhe couldn't get at the steering-gear and land the ship. We begged andbegged him not to, but it warn't no use; so he got down on his hands andknees, and begun to crawl an inch at a time, we a-holding our breath andwatching. After he got to the middle of the boat he crept slower thanever, and it did seem like years to me. But at last we see him get to theprofessor's head, and sort of raise up soft and look a good spell in hisface and listen. Then we see him begin to inch along again toward theprofessor's feet where the steering-buttons was. Well, he got there allsafe, and was reaching slow and steady toward the buttons, but he knockeddown something that made a noise, and we see him slump down flat an' softin the bottom, and lay still. The professor stirred, and says, "What'sthat?" But everybody kept dead still and quiet, and he begun to mutterand mumble and nestle, like a person that's going to wake up, and Ithought I was going to die, I was so worried and scared.</p><p> Then a cloud slid over the moon, and I 'most cried, I was so glad. Sheburied herself deeper and deeper into the cloud, and it got so dark wecouldn't see Tom. Then it began to sprinkle rain, and we could hear theprofessor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing the weather. We wasafraid every minute he would touch Tom, and then we would be goners, andno help; but Tom was already on his way back, and when we felt his handson our knees my breath stopped sudden, and my heart fell down 'mongst myother works, because I couldn't tell in the dark but it might be theprofessor! which I thought it WAS.</p><p> Dear! I was so glad to have him back that I was just as near happy as aperson could be that was up in the air that way with a deranged man. Youcan't land a balloon in the dark, and so I hoped it would keep onraining, for I didn't want Tom to go meddling any more and make us soawful uncomfortable. Well, I got my wish. It drizzled and drizzled alongthe rest of the night, which wasn't long, though it did seem so; and atdaybreak it cleared, and the world looked mighty soft and gray andpretty, and the forests and fields so good to see again, and the horsesand cattle standing sober and thinking. Next, the sun come a-blazing upgay and splendid, and then we began to feel rusty and stretchy, and firstwe knowed we was all asleep.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter 3</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> TOM EXPLAINS</p><p> WE went to sleep about four o'clock, and woke up about eight. Theprofessor was setting back there at his end, looking glum. He pitched ussome breakfast, but he told us not to come abaft the midship compass.That was about the middle of the boat. Well, when you are sharp-set, andyou eat and satisfy yourself, everything looks pretty different from whatit done before. It makes a body feel pretty near comfortable, even whenhe is up in a balloon with a genius. We got to talking together.</p><p> There was one thing that kept bothering me, and by and by I says:</p><p> "Tom, didn't we start east?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "How fast have we been going?"</p><p> "Well, you heard what the professor said when he was raging round.Sometimes, he said, we was making fifty miles an hour, sometimes ninety,sometimes a hundred; said that with a gale to help he could make threehundred any time, and said if he wanted the gale, and wanted it blowingthe right direction, he only had to go up higher or down lower to findit."</p><p> "Well, then, it's just as I reckoned. The professor lied."</p><p> "Why?"</p><p> "Because if we was going so fast we ought to be past Illinois, oughtn'twe?"</p><p> "Certainly."</p><p> "Well, we ain't."</p><p> "What's the reason we ain't?"</p><p> "I know by the color. We're right over Illinois yet. And you can see foryourself that Indiana ain't in sight."</p><p> "I wonder what's the matter with you, Huck. You know by the COLOR?"</p><p> "Yes, of course I do."</p><p> "What's the color got to do with it?"</p><p> "It's got everything to do with it. Illinois is green, Indiana is pink.You show me any pink down here, if you can. No, sir; it's green."</p><p> "Indiana PINK? Why, what a lie!"</p><p> "It ain't no lie; I've seen it on the map, and it's pink."</p><p> You never see a person so aggravated and disgusted. He says:</p><p> "Well, if I was such a numbskull as you, Huck Finn, I would jump over.Seen it on the map! Huck Finn, did you reckon the States was the samecolor out-of-doors as they are on the map?"</p><p> "Tom Sawyer, what's a map for? Ain't it to learn you facts?"</p><p> "Of course."</p><p> "Well, then, how's it going to do that if it tells lies? That's what Iwant to know."</p><p> "Shucks, you muggins! It don't tell lies."</p><p> "It don't, don't it?"</p><p> "No, it don't."</p><p> "All right, then; if it don't, there ain't no two States the same color.You git around THAT if you can, Tom Sawyer."</p><p> He see I had him, and Jim see it too; and I tell you, I felt pretty good,for Tom Sawyer was always a hard person to git ahead of. Jim slapped hisleg and says:</p><p> "I tell YOU! dat's smart, dat's right down smart. Ain't no use, Mars Tom;he got you DIS time, sho'!" He slapped his leg again, and says, "My LAN',but it was smart one!"</p><p> I never felt so good in my life; and yet I didn't know I was sayinganything much till it was out. I was just mooning along, perfectlycareless, and not expecting anything was going to happen, and neverTHINKING of such a thing at all, when, all of a sudden, out it came. Why,it was just as much a surprise to me as it was to any of them. It wasjust the same way it is when a person is munching along on a hunk ofcorn-pone, and not thinking about anything, and all of a sudden bitesinto a di'mond. Now all that HE knows first off is that it's some kind ofgravel he's bit into; but he don't find out it's a di'mond till he gitsit out and brushes off the sand and crumbs and one thing or another, andhas a look at it, and then he's surprised and glad--yes, and proud too;though when you come to look the thing straight in the eye, he ain'tentitled to as much credit as he would 'a' been if he'd been HUNTINGdi'monds. You can see the difference easy if you think it over. You see,an accident, that way, ain't fairly as big a thing as a thing that's donea-purpose. Anybody could find that di'mond in that corn-pone; but mindyou, it's got to be somebody that's got THAT KIND OF A CORN-PONE. That'swhere that feller's credit comes in, you see; and that's where mine comesin. I don't claim no great things--I don't reckon I could 'a' done itagain--but I done it that time; that's all I claim. And I hadn't no moreidea I could do such a thing, and warn't any more thinking about it ortrying to, than you be this minute. Why, I was just as ca'm, a bodycouldn't be any ca'mer, and yet, all of a sudden, out it come. I've oftenthought of that time, and I can remember just the way everything looked,same as if it was only last week. I can see it all: beautiful rollingcountry with woods and fields and lakes for hundreds and hundreds ofmiles all around, and towns and villages scattered everywheres under us,here and there and yonder; and the professor mooning over a chart on hislittle table, and Tom's cap flopping in the rigging where it was hung upto dry. And one thing in particular was a bird right alongside, not tenfoot off, going our way and trying to keep up, but losing ground all thetime; and a railroad train doing the same thing down there, sliding amongthe trees and farms, and pouring out a long cloud of black smoke and nowand then a little puff of white; and when the white was gone so long youhad almost forgot it, you would hear a little faint toot, and that wasthe whistle. And we left the bird and the train both behind, 'WAY behind,and done it easy, too.</p><p> But Tom he was huffy, and said me and Jim was a couple of ignorantblatherskites, and then he says:</p><p> "Suppose there's a brown calf and a big brown dog, and an artist ismaking a picture of them. What is the MAIN thing that that artist has gotto do? He has got to paint them so you can tell them apart the minute youlook at them, hain't he? Of course. Well, then, do you want him to go andpaint BOTH of them brown? Certainly you don't. He paints one of themblue, and then you can't make no mistake. It's just the same with themaps. That's why they make every State a different color; it ain't todeceive you, it's to keep you from deceiving yourself."</p><p> But I couldn't see no argument about that, and neither could Jim. Jimshook his head, and says:</p><p> "Why, Mars Tom, if you knowed what chuckle-heads dem painters is, you'dwait a long time before you'd fetch one er DEM in to back up a fac'. I'sgwine to tell you, den you kin see for you'self. I see one of 'ema-paintin' away, one day, down in ole Hank Wilson's back lot, en I wentdown to see, en he was paintin' dat old brindle cow wid de near horngone--you knows de one I means. En I ast him what he's paintin' her for,en he say when he git her painted, de picture's wuth a hundred dollars.Mars Tom, he could a got de cow fer fifteen, en I tole him so. Well, sah,if you'll b'lieve me, he jes' shuck his head, dat painter did, en went ona-dobbin'. Bless you, Mars Tom, DEY don't know nothin'."</p><p> Tom lost his temper. I notice a person 'most always does that's got laidout in an argument. He told us to shut up, and maybe we'd feel better.Then he see a town clock away off down yonder, and he took up the glassand looked at it, and then looked at his silver turnip, and then at theclock, and then at the turnip again, and says:</p><p> "That's funny! That clock's near about an hour fast."</p><p> So he put up his turnip. Then he see another clock, and took a look, andit was an hour fast too. That puzzled him.</p><p> "That's a mighty curious thing," he says. "I don't understand it."</p><p> Then he took the glass and hunted up another clock, and sure enough itwas an hour fast too. Then his eyes began to spread and his breath tocome out kinder gaspy like, and he says:</p><p> "Ger-reat Scott, it's the LONGITUDE!"</p><p> I says, considerably scared:</p><p> "Well, what's been and gone and happened now?"</p><p> "Why, the thing that's happened is that this old bladder has slid overIllinois and Indiana and Ohio like nothing, and this is the east end ofPennsylvania or New York, or somewheres around there."</p><p> "Tom Sawyer, you don't mean it!"</p><p> "Yes, I do, and it's dead sure. We've covered about fifteen degrees oflongitude since we left St. Louis yesterday afternoon, and them clocksare right. We've come close on to eight hundred miles."</p><p> I didn't believe it, but it made the cold streaks trickle down my backjust the same. In my experience I knowed it wouldn't take much short oftwo weeks to do it down the Mississippi on a raft. Jim was working hismind and studying. Pretty soon he says:</p><p> "Mars Tom, did you say dem clocks uz right?"</p><p> "Yes, they're right."</p><p> "Ain't yo' watch right, too?"</p><p> "She's right for St. Louis, but she's an hour wrong for here."</p><p> "Mars Tom, is you tryin' to let on dat de time ain't de SAMEeverywheres?"</p><p> "No, it ain't the same everywheres, by a long shot."</p><p> Jim looked distressed, and says:</p><p> "It grieves me to hear you talk like dat, Mars Tom; I's right downashamed to hear you talk like dat, arter de way you's been raised.Yassir, it'd break yo' Aunt Polly's heart to hear you."</p><p> Tom was astonished. He looked Jim over wondering, and didn't say nothing,and Jim went on:</p><p> "Mars Tom, who put de people out yonder in St. Louis? De Lord done it.Who put de people here whar we is? De Lord done it. Ain' dey bofe hischildren? 'Cose dey is. WELL, den! is he gwine to SCRIMINATE 'twixt 'em?"</p><p> "Scriminate! I never heard such ignorance. There ain't no discriminatingabout it. When he makes you and some more of his children black, andmakes the rest of us white, what do you call that?"</p><p> Jim see the p'int. He was stuck. He couldn't answer. Tom says:</p><p> "He does discriminate, you see, when he wants to; but this case HEREain't no discrimination of his, it's man's. The Lord made the day, and hemade the night; but he didn't invent the hours, and he didn't distributethem around. Man did that."</p><p> "Mars Tom, is dat so? Man done it?"</p><p> "Certainly."</p><p> "Who tole him he could?"</p><p> "Nobody. He never asked."</p><p> Jim studied a minute, and says:</p><p> "Well, dat do beat me. I wouldn't 'a' tuck no sich resk. But some peopleain't scared o' nothin'. Dey bangs right ahead; DEY don't care whathappens. So den dey's allays an hour's diff'unce everywhah, Mars Tom?"</p><p> "An hour? No! It's four minutes difference for every degree of longitude,you know. Fifteen of 'em's an hour, thirty of 'em's two hours, and so on.When it's one clock Tuesday morning in England, it's eight o'clock thenight before in New York."</p><p> Jim moved a little way along the locker, and you could see he wasinsulted. He kept shaking his head and muttering, and so I slid along tohim and patted him on the leg, and petted him up, and got him over theworst of his feelings, and then he says:</p><p> "Mars Tom talkin' sich talk as dat! Choosday in one place en Monday int'other, bofe in the same day! Huck, dis ain't no place to joke--up herewhah we is. Two days in one day! How you gwine to get two days inter oneday? Can't git two hours inter one hour, kin you? Can't git two niggersinter one nigger skin, kin you? Can't git two gallons of whisky inter aone-gallon jug, kin you? No, sir, 'twould strain de jug. Yes, en even denyou couldn't, I don't believe. Why, looky here, Huck, s'posen de Choosdaywas New Year's--now den! is you gwine to tell me it's dis year in oneplace en las' year in t'other, bofe in de identical same minute? It's debeatenest rubbage! I can't stan' it--I can't stan' to hear tell 'boutit." Then he begun to shiver and turn gray, and Tom says:</p><p> "NOW what's the matter? What's the trouble?"</p><p> Jim could hardly speak, but he says:</p><p> "Mars Tom, you ain't jokin', en it's SO?"</p><p> "No, I'm not, and it is so."</p><p> Jim shivered again, and says:</p><p> "Den dat Monday could be de las' day, en dey wouldn't be no las' day inEngland, en de dead wouldn't be called. We mustn't go over dah, Mars Tom.Please git him to turn back; I wants to be whah--"</p><p> All of a sudden we see something, and all jumped up, and forgoteverything and begun to gaze. Tom says:</p><p> "Ain't that the--" He catched his breath, then says: "It IS, sure as youlive! It's the ocean!"</p><p> That made me and Jim catch our breath, too. Then we all stood petrifiedbut happy, for none of us had ever seen an ocean, or ever expected to.Tom kept muttering:</p><p> "Atlantic Ocean--Atlantic. Land, don't it sound great! And that's IT--andWE are looking at it--we! Why, it's just too splendid to believe!"</p><p> Then we see a big bank of black smoke; and when we got nearer, it was acity--and a monster she was, too, with a thick fringe of ships around oneedge; and we wondered if it was New York, and begun to jaw and disputeabout it, and, first we knowed, it slid from under us and went flyingbehind, and here we was, out over the very ocean itself, and going like acyclone. Then we woke up, I tell you!</p><p> We made a break aft and raised a wail, and begun to beg the professor toturn back and land us, but he jerked out his pistol and motioned us back,and we went, but nobody will ever know how bad we felt.</p><p> The land was gone, all but a little streak, like a snake, away off on theedge of the water, and down under us was just ocean, ocean,ocean--millions of miles of it, heaving and pitching and squirming, andwhite sprays blowing from the wave-tops, and only a few ships in sight,wallowing around and laying over, first on one side and then on t'other,and sticking their bows under and then their sterns; and before longthere warn't no ships at all, and we had the sky and the whole ocean allto ourselves, and the roomiest place I ever see and the lonesomest.</p><h2>Chapter 4</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> STORM </p><p><img alt="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 4" title="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 4" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/tom-sawyer-abroad/chpt-4.jpg" style="max-width:600px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="462006624" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> AND it got lonesomer and lonesomer. There was the big sky up there, emptyand awful deep; and the ocean down there without a thing on it but justthe waves. All around us was a ring, where the sky and the water cometogether; yes, a monstrous big ring it was, and we right in the deadcenter of it--plumb in the center. We was racing along like a prairiefire, but it never made any difference, we couldn't seem to git past thatcenter no way. I couldn't see that we ever gained an inch on that ring.It made a body feel creepy, it was so curious and unaccountable.</p><p> Well, everything was so awful still that we got to talking in a very lowvoice, and kept on getting creepier and lonesomer and less and lesstalky, till at last the talk ran dry altogether, and we just set thereand "thunk," as Jim calls it, and never said a word the longest time.</p><p> The professor never stirred till the sun was overhead, then he stood upand put a kind of triangle to his eye, and Tom said it was a sextant andhe was taking the sun to see whereabouts the balloon was. Then heciphered a little and looked in a book, and then he begun to carry onagain. He said lots of wild things, and, among others, he said he wouldkeep up this hundred-mile gait till the middle of to-morrow afternoon,and then he'd land in London.</p><p> We said we would be humbly thankful.</p><p> He was turning away, but he whirled around when we said that, and give usa long look of his blackest kind--one of the maliciousest andsuspiciousest looks I ever see. Then he says:</p><p> "You want to leave me. Don't try to deny it."</p><p> We didn't know what to say, so we held in and didn't say nothing at all.</p><p> He went aft and set down, but he couldn't seem to git that thing out ofhis mind. Every now and then he would rip out something about it, and tryto make us answer him, but we dasn't.</p><p> It got lonesomer and lonesomer right along, and it did seem to me Icouldn't stand it. It was still worse when night begun to come on. By andby Tom pinched me and whispers:</p><p> "Look!"</p><p> I took a glance aft, and see the professor taking a whet out of a bottle.I didn't like the looks of that. By and by he took another drink, andpretty soon he begun to sing. It was dark now, and getting black andstormy. He went on singing, wilder and wilder, and the thunder begun tomutter, and the wind to wheeze and moan among the ropes, and altogetherit was awful. It got so black we couldn't see him any more, and wished wecouldn't hear him, but we could. Then he got still; but he warn't stillten minutes till we got suspicious, and wished he would start up hisnoise again, so we could tell where he was. By and by there was a flashof lightning, and we see him start to get up, but he staggered and felldown. We heard him scream out in the dark:</p><p> "They don't want to go to England. All right, I'll change the course.They want to leave me. I know they do. Well, they shall--and NOW!"</p><p> I 'most died when he said that. Then he was still again--still so long Icouldn't bear it, and it did seem to me the lightning wouldn't EVER comeagain. But at last there was a blessed flash, and there he was, on hishands and knees crawling, and not four feet from us. My, but his eyes wasterrible! He made a lunge for Tom, and says, "Overboard YOU go!" but itwas already pitch-dark again, and I couldn't see whether he got him ornot, and Tom didn't make a sound.</p><p> There was another long, horrible wait; then there was a flash, and I seeTom's head sink down outside the boat and disappear. He was on therope-ladder that dangled down in the air from the gunnel. The professorlet off a shout and jumped for him, and straight off it was pitch-darkagain, and Jim groaned out, "Po' Mars Tom, he's a goner!" and made a jumpfor the professor, but the professor warn't there.</p><p> Then we heard a couple of terrible screams, and then another not so loud,and then another that was 'way below, and you could only JUST hear it;and I heard Jim say, "Po' Mars Tom!"</p><p> Then it was awful still, and I reckon a person could 'a' counted fourthousand before the next flash come. When it come I see Jim on his knees,with his arms on the locker and his face buried in them, and he wascrying. Before I could look over the edge it was all dark again, and Iwas glad, because I didn't want to see. But when the next flash come, Iwas watching, and down there I see somebody a-swinging in the wind on theladder, and it was Tom!</p><p> "Come up!" I shouts; "come up, Tom!"</p><p> His voice was so weak, and the wind roared so, I couldn't make out whathe said, but I thought he asked was the professor up there. I shouts:</p><p> "No, he's down in the ocean! Come up! Can we help you?"</p><p> Of course, all this in the dark.</p><p> "Huck, who is you hollerin' at?"</p><p> "I'm hollerin' at Tom."</p><p> "Oh, Huck, how kin you act so, when you know po' Mars Tom--" Then he letoff an awful scream, and flung his head and his arms back and let offanother one, because there was a white glare just then, and he had raisedup his face just in time to see Tom's, as white as snow, rise above thegunnel and look him right in the eye. He thought it was Tom's ghost, yousee.</p><p> Tom clumb aboard, and when Jim found it WAS him, and not his ghost, hehugged him, and called him all sorts of loving names, and carried on likehe was gone crazy, he was so glad. Says I:</p><p> "What did you wait for, Tom? Why didn't you come up at first?"</p><p> "I dasn't, Huck. I knowed somebody plunged down past me, but I didn'tknow who it was in the dark. It could 'a' been you, it could 'a' beenJim."</p><p> That was the way with Tom Sawyer--always sound. He warn't coming up tillhe knowed where the professor was.</p><p> The storm let go about this time with all its might; and it was dreadfulthe way the thunder boomed and tore, and the lightning glared out, andthe wind sung and screamed in the rigging, and the rain come down. Onesecond you couldn't see your hand before you, and the next you couldcount the threads in your coat-sleeve, and see a whole wide desert ofwaves pitching and tossing through a kind of veil of rain. A storm likethat is the loveliest thing there is, but it ain't at its best when youare up in the sky and lost, and it's wet and lonesome, and there's justbeen a death in the family.</p><p> We set there huddled up in the bow, and talked low about the poorprofessor; and everybody was sorry for him, and sorry the world had madefun of him and treated him so harsh, when he was doing the best he could,and hadn't a friend nor nobody to encourage him and keep him frombrooding his mind away and going deranged. There was plenty of clothesand blankets and everything at the other end, but we thought we'd ruthertake the rain than go meddling back there.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter 5</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> LAND</p><p> WE tried to make some plans, but we couldn't come to no agreement. Me andJim was for turning around and going back home, but Tom allowed that bythe time daylight come, so we could see our way, we would be so fartoward England that we might as well go there, and come back in a ship,and have the glory of saying we done it.</p><p> About midnight the storm quit and the moon come out and lit up the ocean,and we begun to feel comfortable and drowsy; so we stretched out on thelockers and went to sleep, and never woke up again till sun-up. The seawas sparkling like di'monds, and it was nice weather, and pretty soon ourthings was all dry again.</p><p> We went aft to find some breakfast, and the first thing we noticed wasthat there was a dim light burning in a compass back there under a hood.Then Tom was disturbed. He says:</p><p> "You know what that means, easy enough. It means that somebody has got tostay on watch and steer this thing the same as he would a ship, or she'llwander around and go wherever the wind wants her to."</p><p> "Well," I says, "what's she been doing since--er--since we had theaccident?"</p><p> "Wandering," he says, kinder troubled--"wandering, without any doubt.She's in a wind now that's blowing her south of east. We don't know howlong that's been going on, either."</p><p> So then he p'inted her east, and said he would hold her there till werousted out the breakfast. The professor had laid in everything a bodycould want; he couldn't 'a' been better fixed. There wasn't no milk forthe coffee, but there was water, and everything else you could want, anda charcoal stove and the fixings for it, and pipes and cigars andmatches; and wine and liquor, which warn't in our line; and books, andmaps, and charts, and an accordion; and furs, and blankets, and no end ofrubbish, like brass beads and brass jewelry, which Tom said was a suresign that he had an idea of visiting among savages. There was money, too.Yes, the professor was well enough fixed.</p><p> After breakfast Tom learned me and Jim how to steer, and divided us allup into four-hour watches, turn and turn about; and when his watch wasout I took his place, and he got out the professor's papers and pens andwrote a letter home to his aunt Polly, telling her everything that hadhappened to us, and dated it "IN THE WELKIN, APPROACHING ENGLAND," andfolded it together and stuck it fast with a red wafer, and directed it,and wrote above the direction, in big writing, "FROM TOM SAWYER, THEERRONORT," and said it would stump old Nat Parsons, the postmaster, whenit come along in the mail. I says:</p><p> "Tom Sawyer, this ain't no welkin, it's a balloon."</p><p> "Well, now, who SAID it was a welkin, smarty?"</p><p> "You've wrote it on the letter, anyway."</p><p> "What of it? That don't mean that the balloon's the welkin."</p><p> "Oh, I thought it did. Well, then, what is a welkin?"</p><p> I see in a minute he was stuck. He raked and scraped around in his mind,but he couldn't find nothing, so he had to say:</p><p> "I don't know, and nobody don't know. It's just a word, and it's a mightygood word, too. There ain't many that lays over it. I don't believethere's ANY that does."</p><p> "Shucks!" I says. "But what does it MEAN?--that's the p'int."</p><p> "I don't know what it means, I tell you. It's a word that people usesfor--for--well, it's ornamental. They don't put ruffles on a shirt tokeep a person warm, do they?"</p><p> "Course they don't."</p><p> "But they put them ON, don't they?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "All right, then; that letter I wrote is a shirt, and the welkin's theruffle on it."</p><p> I judged that that would gravel Jim, and it did.</p><p> "Now, Mars Tom, it ain't no use to talk like dat; en, moreover, it'ssinful. You knows a letter ain't no shirt, en dey ain't no ruffles on it,nuther. Dey ain't no place to put 'em on; you can't put em on, and deywouldn't stay ef you did."</p><p> "Oh DO shut up, and wait till something's started that you know somethingabout."</p><p> "Why, Mars Tom, sholy you can't mean to say I don't know about shirts,when, goodness knows, I's toted home de washin' ever sence--"</p><p> "I tell you, this hasn't got anything to do with shirts. I only--"</p><p> "Why, Mars Tom, you said yo'self dat a letter--"</p><p> "Do you want to drive me crazy? Keep still. I only used it as ametaphor."</p><p> That word kinder bricked us up for a minute. Then Jim says--rather timid,because he see Tom was getting pretty tetchy:</p><p> "Mars Tom, what is a metaphor?"</p><p> "A metaphor's a--well, it's a--a--a metaphor's an illustration." He seeTHAT didn't git home, so he tried again. "When I say birds of a featherflocks together, it's a metaphorical way of saying--"</p><p> "But dey DON'T, Mars Tom. No, sir, 'deed dey don't. Dey ain't no feathersdat's more alike den a bluebird en a jaybird, but ef you waits till youcatches dem birds together, you'll--"</p><p> "Oh, give us a rest! You can't get the simplest little thing through yourthick skull. Now don't bother me any more."</p><p> Jim was satisfied to stop. He was dreadful pleased with himself forcatching Tom out. The minute Tom begun to talk about birds I judged hewas a goner, because Jim knowed more about birds than both of us puttogether. You see, he had killed hundreds and hundreds of them, andthat's the way to find out about birds. That's the way people does thatwrites books about birds, and loves them so that they'll go hungry andtired and take any amount of trouble to find a new bird and kill it.Their name is ornithologers, and I could have been an ornithologermyself, because I always loved birds and creatures; and I started out tolearn how to be one, and I see a bird setting on a limb of a high tree,singing with its head tilted back and its mouth open, and before Ithought I fired, and his song stopped and he fell straight down from thelimb, all limp like a rag, and I run and picked him up and he was dead,and his body was warm in my hand, and his head rolled about this way andthat, like his neck was broke, and there was a little white skin over hiseyes, and one little drop of blood on the side of his head; and, laws! Icouldn't see nothing more for the tears; and I hain't never murdered nocreature since that warn't doing me no harm, and I ain't going to.</p><p> But I was aggravated about that welkin. I wanted to know. I got thesubject up again, and then Tom explained, the best he could. He said whena person made a big speech the newspapers said the shouts of the peoplemade the welkin ring. He said they always said that, but none of themever told what it was, so he allowed it just meant outdoors and up high.Well, that seemed sensible enough, so I was satisfied, and said so. Thatpleased Tom and put him in a good humor again, and he says:</p><p> "Well, it's all right, then; and we'll let bygones be bygones. I don'tknow for certain what a welkin is, but when we land in London we'll makeit ring, anyway, and don't you forget it."</p><p> He said an erronort was a person who sailed around in balloons; and saidit was a mighty sight finer to be Tom Sawyer the Erronort than to be TomSawyer the Traveler, and we would be heard of all round the world, if wepulled through all right, and so he wouldn't give shucks to be a travelernow.</p><p> Toward the middle of the afternoon we got everything ready to land, andwe felt pretty good, too, and proud; and we kept watching with theglasses, like Columbus discovering America. But we couldn't see nothingbut ocean. The afternoon wasted out and the sun shut down, and stillthere warn't no land anywheres. We wondered what was the matter, butreckoned it would come out all right, so we went on steering east, butwent up on a higher level so we wouldn't hit any steeples or mountains inthe dark.</p><p> It was my watch till midnight, and then it was Jim's; but Tom stayed up,because he said ship captains done that when they was making the land,and didn't stand no regular watch.</p><p> Well, when daylight come, Jim give a shout, and we jumped up and lookedover, and there was the land sure enough--land all around, as far as youcould see, and perfectly level and yaller. We didn't know how long we'dbeen over it. There warn't no trees, nor hills, nor rocks, nor towns, andTom and Jim had took it for the sea. They took it for the sea in a deadca'm; but we was so high up, anyway, that if it had been the sea andrough, it would 'a' looked smooth, all the same, in the night, that way.</p><p> We was all in a powerful excitement now, and grabbed the glasses andhunted everywheres for London, but couldn't find hair nor hide of it, norany other settlement--nor any sign of a lake or a river, either. Tom wasclean beat. He said it warn't his notion of England; he thought Englandlooked like America, and always had that idea. So he said we better havebreakfast, and then drop down and inquire the quickest way to London. Wecut the breakfast pretty short, we was so impatient. As we slanted alongdown, the weather began to moderate, and pretty soon we shed our furs.But it kept ON moderating, and in a precious little while it was 'mosttoo moderate. We was close down now, and just blistering!</p><p> We settled down to within thirty foot of the land--that is, it was landif sand is land; for this wasn't anything but pure sand. Tom and me clumbdown the ladder and took a run to stretch our legs, and it felt amazinggood--that is, the stretching did, but the sand scorched our feet likehot embers. Next, we see somebody coming, and started to meet him; but weheard Jim shout, and looked around and he was fairly dancing, and makingsigns, and yelling. We couldn't make out what he said, but we was scaredanyway, and begun to heel it back to the balloon. When we got closeenough, we understood the words, and they made me sick:</p><p> "Run! Run fo' yo' life! Hit's a lion; I kin see him thoo de glass! Run,boys; do please heel it de bes' you kin. He's bu'sted outen de menagerie,en dey ain't nobody to stop him!"</p><p> It made Tom fly, but it took the stiffening all out of my legs. I couldonly just gasp along the way you do in a dream when there's a ghostgaining on you.</p><p> Tom got to the ladder and shinned up it a piece and waited for me; and assoon as I got a foothold on it he shouted to Jim to soar away. But Jimhad clean lost his head, and said he had forgot how. So Tom shinned alongup and told me to follow; but the lion was arriving, fetching a mostghastly roar with every lope, and my legs shook so I dasn't try to takeone of them out of the rounds for fear the other one would give way underme.</p><p> But Tom was aboard by this time, and he started the balloon up a little,and stopped it again as soon as the end of the ladder was ten or twelvefeet above ground. And there was the lion, a-ripping around under me, androaring and springing up in the air at the ladder, and only missing itabout a quarter of an inch, it seemed to me. It was delicious to be outof his reach, perfectly delicious, and made me feel good and thankful allup one side; but I was hanging there helpless and couldn't climb, andthat made me feel perfectly wretched and miserable all down the other. Itis most seldom that a person feels so mixed like that; and it is not tobe recommended, either.</p><p> Tom asked me what he'd better do, but I didn't know. He asked me if Icould hold on whilst he sailed away to a safe place and left the lionbehind. I said I could if he didn't go no higher than he was now; but ifhe went higher I would lose my head and fall, sure. So he said, "Take agood grip," and he started.</p><p> "Don't go so fast," I shouted. "It makes my head swim."</p><p> He had started like a lightning express. He slowed down, and we glidedover the sand slower, but still in a kind of sickening way; for it ISuncomfortable to see things sliding and gliding under you like that, andnot a sound.</p><p> But pretty soon there was plenty of sound, for the lion was catching up.His noise fetched others. You could see them coming on the lope fromevery direction, and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of themunder me, jumping up at the ladder and snarling and snapping at eachother; and so we went skimming along over the sand, and these fellersdoing what they could to help us to not forgit the occasion; and thensome other beasts come, without an invite, and they started a regularriot down there.</p><p> We see this plan was a mistake. We couldn't ever git away from them atthis gait, and I couldn't hold on forever. So Tom took a think, andstruck another idea. That was, to kill a lion with the pepper-boxrevolver, and then sail away while the others stopped to fight over thecarcass. So he stopped the balloon still, and done it, and then we sailedoff while the fuss was going on, and come down a quarter of a mile off,and they helped me aboard; but by the time we was out of reach again,that gang was on hand once more. And when they see we was really gone andthey couldn't get us, they sat down on their hams and looked up at us sokind of disappointed that it was as much as a person could do not to seeTHEIR side of the matter.</p><h2>Chapter 6</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> IT'S A CARAVAN </p><p><img alt="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 6" title="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 6" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/tom-sawyer-abroad/chpt-6.jpg" style="max-width:600px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1051006466" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> I WAS so weak that the only thing I wanted was a chance to lay down, so Imade straight for my locker-bunk, and stretched myself out there. But abody couldn't get back his strength in no such oven as that, so Tom givethe command to soar, and Jim started her aloft.</p><p> We had to go up a mile before we struck comfortable weather where it wasbreezy and pleasant and just right, and pretty soon I was all straightagain. Tom had been setting quiet and thinking; but now he jumps up andsays:</p><p> "I bet you a thousand to one I know where we are. We're in the GreatSahara, as sure as guns!"</p><p> He was so excited he couldn't hold still; but I wasn't. I says:</p><p> "Well, then, where's the Great Sahara? In England or in Scotland?"</p><p> "'Tain't in either; it's in Africa."</p><p> Jim's eyes bugged out, and he begun to stare down with no end ofinterest, because that was where his originals come from; but I didn'tmore than half believe it. I couldn't, you know; it seemed too awful faraway for us to have traveled.</p><p> But Tom was full of his discovery, as he called it, and said the lionsand the sand meant the Great Desert, sure. He said he could 'a' foundout, before we sighted land, that we was crowding the land somewheres, ifhe had thought of one thing; and when we asked him what, he said:</p><p> "These clocks. They're chronometers. You always read about them in seavoyages. One of them is keeping Grinnage time, and the other is keepingSt. Louis time, like my watch. When we left St. Louis it was four in theafternoon by my watch and this clock, and it was ten at night by thisGrinnage clock. Well, at this time of the year the sun sets at aboutseven o'clock. Now I noticed the time yesterday evening when the sun wentdown, and it was half-past five o'clock by the Grinnage clock, and halfpast 11 A.M. by my watch and the other clock. You see, the sun rose andset by my watch in St. Louis, and the Grinnage clock was six hours fast;but we've come so far east that it comes within less than half an hour ofsetting by the Grinnage clock now, and I'm away out--more than fourhours and a half out. You see, that meant that we was closing up on thelongitude of Ireland, and would strike it before long if we was p'intedright--which we wasn't. No, sir, we've been a-wandering--wandering 'waydown south of east, and it's my opinion we are in Africa. Look at thismap. You see how the shoulder of Africa sticks out to the west. Think howfast we've traveled; if we had gone straight east we would be long pastEngland by this time. You watch for noon, all of you, and we'll stand up,and when we can't cast a shadow we'll find that this Grinnage clock iscoming mighty close to marking twelve. Yes, sir, I think we're in Africa;and it's just bully."</p><p> Jim was gazing down with the glass. He shook his head and says:</p><p> "Mars Tom, I reckon dey's a mistake som'er's, hain't seen no niggersyit."</p><p> "That's nothing; they don't live in the desert. What is that, 'way offyonder? Gimme a glass."</p><p> He took a long look, and said it was like a black string stretched acrossthe sand, but he couldn't guess what it was.</p><p> "Well," I says, "I reckon maybe you've got a chance now to find outwhereabouts this balloon is, because as like as not that is one of theselines here, that's on the map, that you call meridians of longitude, andwe can drop down and look at its number, and--"</p><p> "Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, I never see such a lunkhead as you. Did yous'pose there's meridians of longitude on the EARTH?"</p><p> "Tom Sawyer, they're set down on the map, and you know it perfectly well,and here they are, and you can see for yourself."</p><p> "Of course they're on the map, but that's nothing; there ain't any on theGROUND."</p><p> "Tom, do you know that to be so?"</p><p> "Certainly I do."</p><p> "Well, then, that map's a liar again. I never see such a liar as thatmap."</p><p> He fired up at that, and I was ready for him, and Jim was warming hisopinion, too, and next minute we'd 'a' broke loose on another argument,if Tom hadn't dropped the glass and begun to clap his hands like a maniacand sing out:</p><p> "Camels!--Camels!"</p><p> So I grabbed a glass and Jim, too, and took a look, but I wasdisappointed, and says:</p><p> "Camels your granny; they're spiders."</p><p> "Spiders in a desert, you shad? Spiders walking in a procession? Youdon't ever reflect, Huck Finn, and I reckon you really haven't gotanything to reflect WITH. Don't you know we're as much as a mile up inthe air, and that that string of crawlers is two or three miles away?Spiders, good land! Spiders as big as a cow? Perhaps you'd like to godown and milk one of 'em. But they're camels, just the same. It's acaravan, that's what it is, and it's a mile long."</p><p> "Well, then, let's go down and look at it. I don't believe in it, andain't going to till I see it and know it."</p><p> "All right," he says, and give the command:</p><p> "Lower away."</p><p> As we come slanting down into the hot weather, we could see that it wascamels, sure enough, plodding along, an everlasting string of them, withbales strapped to them, and several hundred men in long white robes, anda thing like a shawl bound over their heads and hanging down with tasselsand fringes; and some of the men had long guns and some hadn't, and somewas riding and some was walking. And the weather--well, it was justroasting. And how slow they did creep along! We swooped down now, all ofa sudden, and stopped about a hundred yards over their heads.</p><p> The men all set up a yell, and some of them fell flat on their stomachs,some begun to fire their guns at us, and the rest broke and scamperedevery which way, and so did the camels.</p><p> We see that we was making trouble, so we went up again about a mile, tothe cool weather, and watched them from there. It took them an hour toget together and form the procession again; then they started along, butwe could see by the glasses that they wasn't paying much attention toanything but us. We poked along, looking down at them with the glasses,and by and by we see a big sand mound, and something like people theother side of it, and there was something like a man laying on top of themound that raised his head up every now and then, and seemed to bewatching the caravan or us, we didn't know which. As the caravan gotnearer, he sneaked down on the other side and rushed to the other men andhorses--for that is what they was--and we see them mount in a hurry; andnext, here they come, like a house afire, some with lances and some withlong guns, and all of them yelling the best they could.</p><p> They come a-tearing down on to the caravan, and the next minute bothsides crashed together and was all mixed up, and there was such anotherpopping of guns as you never heard, and the air got so full of smoke youcould only catch glimpses of them struggling together. There must 'a'been six hundred men in that battle, and it was terrible to see. Thenthey broke up into gangs and groups, fighting tooth and nail, andscurrying and scampering around, and laying into each other likeeverything; and whenever the smoke cleared a little you could see deadand wounded people and camels scattered far and wide and all about, andcamels racing off in every direction.</p><p> At last the robbers see they couldn't win, so their chief sounded asignal, and all that was left of them broke away and went scamperingacross the plain. The last man to go snatched up a child and carried itoff in front of him on his horse, and a woman run screaming and beggingafter him, and followed him away off across the plain till she wasseparated a long ways from her people; but it warn't no use, and she hadto give it up, and we see her sink down on the sand and cover her facewith her hands. Then Tom took the hellum, and started for that yahoo, andwe come a-whizzing down and made a swoop, and knocked him out of thesaddle, child and all; and he was jarred considerable, but the childwasn't hurt, but laid there working its hands and legs in the air like atumble-bug that's on its back and can't turn over. The man wentstaggering off to overtake his horse, and didn't know what had hit him,for we was three or four hundred yards up in the air by this time.</p><p> We judged the woman would go and get the child now; but she didn't. Wecould see her, through the glass, still setting there, with her headbowed down on her knees; so of course she hadn't seen the performance,and thought her child was clean gone with the man. She was nearly a halfa mile from her people, so we thought we might go down to the child,which was about a quarter of a mile beyond her, and snake it to herbefore the caravan people could git to us to do us any harm; and besides,we reckoned they had enough business on their hands for one while,anyway, with the wounded. We thought we'd chance it, and we did. Weswooped down and stopped, and Jim shinned down the ladder and fetched upthe kid, which was a nice fat little thing, and in a noble good humor,too, considering it was just out of a battle and been tumbled off of ahorse; and then we started for the mother, and stopped back of her andtolerable near by, and Jim slipped down and crept up easy, and when hewas close back of her the child goo-goo'd, the way a child does, and sheheard it, and whirled and fetched a shriek of joy, and made a jump forthe kid and snatched it and hugged it, and dropped it and hugged Jim, andthen snatched off a gold chain and hung it around Jim's neck, and huggedhim again, and jerked up the child again, a-sobbing and glorifying allthe time; and Jim he shoved for the ladder and up it, and in a minute wewas back up in the sky and the woman was staring up, with the back of herhead between her shoulders and the child with its arms locked around herneck. And there she stood, as long as we was in sight a-sailing away inthe sky.</p><h2>Chapter 7</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> TOM RESPECTS THE FLEA </p><p><img alt="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 7" title="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 7" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/tom-sawyer-abroad/chpt-7.jpg" style="max-width:600px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1345506387" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> "NOON!" says Tom, and so it was. His shadder was just a blot around hisfeet. We looked, and the Grinnage clock was so close to twelve thedifference didn't amount to nothing. So Tom said London was right northof us or right south of us, one or t'other, and he reckoned by theweather and the sand and the camels it was north; and a good many milesnorth, too; as many as from New York to the city of Mexico, he guessed.</p><p> Jim said he reckoned a balloon was a good deal the fastest thing in theworld, unless it might be some kinds of birds--a wild pigeon, maybe, or arailroad.</p><p> But Tom said he had read about railroads in England going nearly ahundred miles an hour for a little ways, and there never was a bird inthe world that could do that--except one, and that was a flea.</p><p> "A flea? Why, Mars Tom, in de fust place he ain't a bird, stricklyspeakin'--"</p><p> "He ain't a bird, eh? Well, then, what is he?"</p><p> "I don't rightly know, Mars Tom, but I speck he's only jist a' animal.No, I reckon dat won't do, nuther, he ain't big enough for a' animal. Hemus' be a bug. Yassir, dat's what he is, he's a bug."</p><p> "I bet he ain't, but let it go. What's your second place?"</p><p> "Well, in de second place, birds is creturs dat goes a long ways, but aflea don't."</p><p> "He don't, don't he? Come, now, what IS a long distance, if you know?"</p><p> "Why, it's miles, and lots of 'em--anybody knows dat."</p><p> "Can't a man walk miles?"</p><p> "Yassir, he kin."</p><p> "As many as a railroad?"</p><p> "Yassir, if you give him time."</p><p> "Can't a flea?"</p><p> "Well--I s'pose so--ef you gives him heaps of time."</p><p> "Now you begin to see, don't you, that DISTANCE ain't the thing to judgeby, at all; it's the time it takes to go the distance IN that COUNTS,ain't it?"</p><p> "Well, hit do look sorter so, but I wouldn't 'a' b'lieved it, Mars Tom."</p><p> "It's a matter of PROPORTION, that's what it is; and when you come togauge a thing's speed by its size, where's your bird and your man andyour railroad, alongside of a flea? The fastest man can't run more thanabout ten miles in an hour--not much over ten thousand times his ownlength. But all the books says any common ordinary third-class flea canjump a hundred and fifty times his own length; yes, and he can make fivejumps a second too--seven hundred and fifty times his own length, in onelittle second--for he don't fool away any time stopping and starting--hedoes them both at the same time; you'll see, if you try to put yourfinger on him. Now that's a common, ordinary, third-class flea's gait;but you take an Eyetalian FIRST-class, that's been the pet of thenobility all his life, and hasn't ever knowed what want or sickness orexposure was, and he can jump more than three hundred times his ownlength, and keep it up all day, five such jumps every second, which isfifteen hundred times his own length. Well, suppose a man could gofifteen hundred times his own length in a second--say, a mile and a half.It's ninety miles a minute; it's considerable more than five thousandmiles an hour. Where's your man NOW?--yes, and your bird, and yourrailroad, and your balloon? Laws, they don't amount to shucks 'longsideof a flea. A flea is just a comet b'iled down small."</p><p> Jim was a good deal astonished, and so was I. Jim said:</p><p> "Is dem figgers jist edjackly true, en no jokin' en no lies, Mars Tom?"</p><p> "Yes, they are; they're perfectly true."</p><p> "Well, den, honey, a body's got to respec' a flea. I ain't had no respec'for um befo', sca'sely, but dey ain't no gittin' roun' it, dey do deserveit, dat's certain."</p><p> "Well, I bet they do. They've got ever so much more sense, and brains,and brightness, in proportion to their size, than any other cretur in theworld. A person can learn them 'most anything; and they learn it quickerthan any other cretur, too. They've been learnt to haul little carriagesin harness, and go this way and that way and t'other way according totheir orders; yes, and to march and drill like soldiers, doing it asexact, according to orders, as soldiers does it. They've been learnt todo all sorts of hard and troublesome things. S'pose you could cultivate aflea up to the size of a man, and keep his natural smartness a-growingand a-growing right along up, bigger and bigger, and keener and keener,in the same proportion--where'd the human race be, do you reckon? Thatflea would be President of the United States, and you couldn't any moreprevent it than you can prevent lightning."</p><p> "My lan', Mars Tom, I never knowed dey was so much TO de beas'. No, sir,I never had no idea of it, and dat's de fac'."</p><p> "There's more to him, by a long sight, than there is to any other cretur,man or beast, in proportion to size. He's the interestingest of them all.People have so much to say about an ant's strength, and an elephant's,and a locomotive's. Shucks, they don't begin with a flea. He can lift twoor three hundred times his own weight. And none of them can come anywherenear it. And, moreover, he has got notions of his own, and is veryparticular, and you can't fool him; his instinct, or his judgment, orwhatever it is, is perfectly sound and clear, and don't ever make amistake. People think all humans are alike to a flea. It ain't so.There's folks that he won't go near, hungry or not hungry, and I'm one ofthem. I've never had one of them on me in my life."</p><p> "Mars Tom!"</p><p> "It's so; I ain't joking."</p><p> "Well, sah, I hain't ever heard de likes o' dat befo'." Jim couldn'tbelieve it, and I couldn't; so we had to drop down to the sand and git asupply and see. Tom was right. They went for me and Jim by the thousand,but not a one of them lit on Tom. There warn't no explaining it, butthere it was and there warn't no getting around it. He said it had alwaysbeen just so, and he'd just as soon be where there was a million of themas not; they'd never touch him nor bother him.</p><p> We went up to the cold weather to freeze 'em out, and stayed a littlespell, and then come back to the comfortable weather and went lazyingalong twenty or twenty-five miles an hour, the way we'd been doing forthe last few hours. The reason was, that the longer we was in thatsolemn, peaceful desert, the more the hurry and fuss got kind of sootheddown in us, and the more happier and contented and satisfied we got tofeeling, and the more we got to liking the desert, and then loving it. Sowe had cramped the speed down, as I was saying, and was having a mostnoble good lazy time, sometimes watching through the glasses, sometimesstretched out on the lockers reading, sometimes taking a nap.</p><p> It didn't seem like we was the same lot that was in such a state to findland and git ashore, but it was. But we had got over that--clean over it.We was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more, and didn't wantto be anywheres else. Why, it seemed just like home; it 'most seemed asif I had been born and raised in it, and Jim and Tom said the same. Andalways I had had hateful people around me, a-nagging at me, and pesteringof me, and scolding, and finding fault, and fussing and bothering, andsticking to me, and keeping after me, and making me do this, and makingme do that and t'other, and always selecting out the things I didn't wantto do, and then giving me Sam Hill because I shirked and done somethingelse, and just aggravating the life out of a body all the time; but uphere in the sky it was so still and sunshiny and lovely, and plenty toeat, and plenty of sleep, and strange things to see, and no nagging andno pestering, and no good people, and just holiday all the time. Land, Iwarn't in no hurry to git out and buck at civilization again. Now, one ofthe worst things about civilization is, that anybody that gits a letterwith trouble in it comes and tells you all about it and makes you feelbad, and the newspapers fetches you the troubles of everybody all overthe world, and keeps you downhearted and dismal 'most all the time, andit's such a heavy load for a person. I hate them newspapers; and I hateletters; and if I had my way I wouldn't allow nobody to load his troubleson to other folks he ain't acquainted with, on t'other side of the world,that way. Well, up in a balloon there ain't any of that, and it's thedarlingest place there is.</p><p> We had supper, and that night was one of the prettiest nights I ever see.The moon made it just like daylight, only a heap softer; and once we seea lion standing all alone by himself, just all alone on the earth, itseemed like, and his shadder laid on the sand by him like a puddle ofink. That's the kind of moonlight to have.</p><p> Mainly we laid on our backs and talked; we didn't want to go to sleep.Tom said we was right in the midst of the Arabian Nights now. He said itwas right along here that one of the cutest things in that book happened;so we looked down and watched while he told about it, because there ain'tanything that is so interesting to look at as a place that a book hastalked about. It was a tale about a camel-driver that had lost his camel,and he come along in the desert and met a man, and says:</p><p> "Have you run across a stray camel to-day?"</p><p> And the man says:</p><p> "Was he blind in his left eye?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "Had he lost an upper front tooth?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "Was his off hind leg lame?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "Was he loaded with millet-seed on one side and honey on the other?"</p><p> "Yes, but you needn't go into no more details--that's the one, and I'min a hurry. Where did you see him?"</p><p> "I hain't seen him at all," the man says.</p><p> "Hain't seen him at all? How can you describe him so close, then?"</p><p> "Because when a person knows how to use his eyes, everything has got ameaning to it; but most people's eyes ain't any good to them. I knowed acamel had been along, because I seen his track. I knowed he was lame inhis off hind leg because he had favored that foot and trod light on it,and his track showed it. I knowed he was blind on his left side becausehe only nibbled the grass on the right side of the trail. I knowed he hadlost an upper front tooth because where he bit into the sod histeeth-print showed it. The millet-seed sifted out on one side--the antstold me that; the honey leaked out on the other--the flies told me that.I know all about your camel, but I hain't seen him."</p><p> Jim says:</p><p> "Go on, Mars Tom, hit's a mighty good tale, and powerful interestin'."</p><p> "That's all," Tom says.</p><p> "ALL?" says Jim, astonished. "What 'come o' de camel?"</p><p> "I don't know."</p><p> "Mars Tom, don't de tale say?"</p><p> "No."</p><p> Jim puzzled a minute, then he says:</p><p> "Well! Ef dat ain't de beatenes' tale ever I struck. Jist gits to deplace whah de intrust is gittin' red-hot, en down she breaks. Why, MarsTom, dey ain't no SENSE in a tale dat acts like dat. Hain't you got noIDEA whether de man got de camel back er not?"</p><p> "No, I haven't."</p><p> I see myself there warn't no sense in the tale, to chop square off thatway before it come to anything, but I warn't going to say so, because Icould see Tom was souring up pretty fast over the way it flatted out andthe way Jim had popped on to the weak place in it, and I don't think it'sfair for everybody to pile on to a feller when he's down. But Tom hewhirls on me and says:</p><p> "What do YOU think of the tale?"</p><p> Of course, then, I had to come out and make a clean breast and say it didseem to me, too, same as it did to Jim, that as long as the tale stoppedsquare in the middle and never got to no place, it really warn't worththe trouble of telling.</p><p> Tom's chin dropped on his breast, and 'stead of being mad, as I reckonedhe'd be, to hear me scoff at his tale that way, he seemed to be only sad;and he says:</p><p> "Some people can see, and some can't--just as that man said. Let alone acamel, if a cyclone had gone by, YOU duffers wouldn't 'a' noticed thetrack."</p><p> I don't know what he meant by that, and he didn't say; it was just one ofhis irrulevances, I reckon--he was full of them, sometimes, when he wasin a close place and couldn't see no other way out--but I didn't mind.We'd spotted the soft place in that tale sharp enough, he couldn't gitaway from that little fact. It graveled him like the nation, too, Ireckon, much as he tried not to let on.</p><h2>Chapter 8</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> THE DISAPPEARING LAKE </p><p><img alt="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 8" title="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 8" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/tom-sawyer-abroad/chpt-8.jpg" style="max-width:600px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1640006308" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> WE had an early breakfast in the morning, and set looking down on thedesert, and the weather was ever so bammy and lovely, although we warn'thigh up. You have to come down lower and lower after sundown in thedesert, because it cools off so fast; and so, by the time it is gettingtoward dawn, you are skimming along only a little ways above the sand.</p><p> We was watching the shadder of the balloon slide along the ground, andnow and then gazing off across the desert to see if anything wasstirring, and then down on the shadder again, when all of a sudden almostright under us we see a lot of men and camels laying scattered about,perfectly quiet, like they was asleep.</p><p> We shut off the power, and backed up and stood over them, and then we seethat they was all dead. It give us the cold shivers. And it made us hushdown, too, and talk low, like people at a funeral. We dropped down slowand stopped, and me and Tom clumb down and went among them. There wasmen, and women, and children. They was dried by the sun and dark andshriveled and leathery, like the pictures of mummies you see in books.And yet they looked just as human, you wouldn't 'a' believed it; justlike they was asleep.</p><p> Some of the people and animals was partly covered with sand, but most ofthem not, for the sand was thin there, and the bed was gravel and hard.Most of the clothes had rotted away; and when you took hold of a rag, ittore with a touch, like spiderweb. Tom reckoned they had been layingthere for years.</p><p> Some of the men had rusty guns by them, some had swords on and had shawlbelts with long, silver-mounted pistols stuck in them. All the camels hadtheir loads on yet, but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt thefreight out on the ground. We didn't reckon the swords was any good tothe dead people any more, so we took one apiece, and some pistols. Wetook a small box, too, because it was so handsome and inlaid so fine; andthen we wanted to bury the people; but there warn't no way to do it thatwe could think of, and nothing to do it with but sand, and that wouldblow away again, of course.</p><p> Then we mounted high and sailed away, and pretty soon that black spot onthe sand was out of sight, and we wouldn't ever see them poor peopleagain in this world. We wondered, and reasoned, and tried to guess howthey come to be there, and how it all happened to them, but we couldn'tmake it out. First we thought maybe they got lost, and wandered aroundand about till their food and water give out and they starved to death;but Tom said no wild animals nor vultures hadn't meddled with them, andso that guess wouldn't do. So at last we give it up, and judged wewouldn't think about it no more, because it made us low-spirited.</p><p> Then we opened the box, and it had gems and jewels in it, quite a pile,and some little veils of the kind the dead women had on, with fringesmade out of curious gold money that we warn't acquainted with. Wewondered if we better go and try to find them again and give it back; butTom thought it over and said no, it was a country that was full ofrobbers, and they would come and steal it; and then the sin would be onus for putting the temptation in their way. So we went on; but I wishedwe had took all they had, so there wouldn't 'a' been no temptation at allleft.</p><p> We had had two hours of that blazing weather down there, and was dreadfulthirsty when we got aboard again. We went straight for the water, but itwas spoiled and bitter, besides being pretty near hot enough to scaldyour mouth. We couldn't drink it. It was Mississippi river water, thebest in the world, and we stirred up the mud in it to see if that wouldhelp, but no, the mud wasn't any better than the water. Well, we hadn'tbeen so very, very thirsty before, while we was interested in the lostpeople, but we was now, and as soon as we found we couldn't have a drink,we was more than thirty-five times as thirsty as we was a quarter of aminute before. Why, in a little while we wanted to hold our mouths openand pant like a dog.</p><p> Tom said to keep a sharp lookout, all around, everywheres, because we'dgot to find an oasis or there warn't no telling what would happen. So wedone it. We kept the glasses gliding around all the time, till our armsgot so tired we couldn't hold them any more. Two hours--three hours--justgazing and gazing, and nothing but sand, sand, SAND, and you could seethe quivering heat-shimmer playing over it. Dear, dear, a body don't knowwhat real misery is till he is thirsty all the way through and is certainhe ain't ever going to come to any water any more. At last I couldn'tstand it to look around on them baking plains; I laid down on the locker,and give it up.</p><p> But by and by Tom raised a whoop, and there she was! A lake, wide andshiny, with pa'm-trees leaning over it asleep, and their shadders in thewater just as soft and delicate as ever you see. I never see anythinglook so good. It was a long ways off, but that warn't anything to us; wejust slapped on a hundred-mile gait, and calculated to be there in sevenminutes; but she stayed the same old distance away, all the time; wecouldn't seem to gain on her; yes, sir, just as far, and shiny, and likea dream; but we couldn't get no nearer; and at last, all of a sudden, shewas gone!</p><p> Tom's eyes took a spread, and he says:</p><p> "Boys, it was a MYridge!" Said it like he was glad. I didn't see nothingto be glad about. I says:</p><p> "Maybe. I don't care nothing about its name, the thing I want to know is,what's become of it?"</p><p> Jim was trembling all over, and so scared he couldn't speak, but hewanted to ask that question himself if he could 'a' done it. Tom says:</p><p> "What's BECOME of it? Why, you see yourself it's gone."</p><p> "Yes, I know; but where's it gone TO?"</p><p> He looked me over and says:</p><p> "Well, now, Huck Finn, where WOULD it go to! Don't you know what amyridge is?"</p><p> "No, I don't. What is it?"</p><p> "It ain't anything but imagination. There ain't anything TO it."</p><p> It warmed me up a little to hear him talk like that, and I says:</p><p> "What's the use you talking that kind of stuff, Tom Sawyer? Didn't I seethe lake?"</p><p> "Yes--you think you did."</p><p> "I don't think nothing about it, I DID see it."</p><p> "I tell you you DIDN'T see it either--because it warn't there to see."</p><p> It astonished Jim to hear him talk so, and he broke in and says, kind ofpleading and distressed:</p><p> "Mars Tom, PLEASE don't say sich things in sich an awful time as dis. Youain't only reskin' yo' own self, but you's reskin' us--same way like AnnaNias en Siffra. De lake WUZ dah--I seen it jis' as plain as I sees you enHuck dis minute."</p><p> I says:</p><p> "Why, he seen it himself! He was the very one that seen it first. NOW,then!"</p><p> "Yes, Mars Tom, hit's so--you can't deny it. We all seen it, en dat PROVEit was dah."</p><p> "Proves it! How does it prove it?"</p><p> "Same way it does in de courts en everywheres, Mars Tom. One pusson mightbe drunk, or dreamy or suthin', en he could be mistaken; en two might,maybe; but I tell you, sah, when three sees a thing, drunk er sober, it'sSO. Dey ain't no gittin' aroun' dat, en you knows it, Mars Tom."</p><p> "I don't know nothing of the kind. There used to be forty thousandmillion people that seen the sun move from one side of the sky to theother every day. Did that prove that the sun DONE it?"</p><p> "Course it did. En besides, dey warn't no 'casion to prove it. A body'at's got any sense ain't gwine to doubt it. Dah she is now--a sailin'thoo de sky, like she allays done."</p><p> Tom turned on me, then, and says:</p><p> "What do YOU say--is the sun standing still?"</p><p> "Tom Sawyer, what's the use to ask such a jackass question? Anybody thatain't blind can see it don't stand still."</p><p> "Well," he says, "I'm lost in the sky with no company but a passel oflow-down animals that don't know no more than the head boss of auniversity did three or four hundred years ago."</p><p> It warn't fair play, and I let him know it. I says:</p><p> "Throwin' mud ain't arguin', Tom Sawyer."</p><p> "Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness gracious, dah's de lake agi'n!" yelledJim, just then. "NOW, Mars Tom, what you gwine to say?"</p><p> Yes, sir, there was the lake again, away yonder across the desert,perfectly plain, trees and all, just the same as it was before. I says:</p><p> "I reckon you're satisfied now, Tom Sawyer."</p><p> But he says, perfectly ca'm:</p><p> "Yes, satisfied there ain't no lake there."</p><p> Jim says:</p><p> "DON'T talk so, Mars Tom--it sk'yers me to hear you. It's so hot, enyou's so thirsty, dat you ain't in yo' right mine, Mars Tom. Oh, butdon't she look good! 'clah I doan' know how I's gwine to wait tell wegits dah, I's SO thirsty."</p><p> "Well, you'll have to wait; and it won't do you no good, either, becausethere ain't no lake there, I tell you."</p><p> I says:</p><p> "Jim, don't you take your eye off of it, and I won't, either."</p><p> "'Deed I won't; en bless you, honey, I couldn't ef I wanted to."</p><p> We went a-tearing along toward it, piling the miles behind us likenothing, but never gaining an inch on it--and all of a sudden it wasgone again! Jim staggered, and 'most fell down. When he got his breath hesays, gasping like a fish:</p><p> "Mars Tom, hit's a GHOS', dat's what it is, en I hopes to goodness weain't gwine to see it no mo'. Dey's BEEN a lake, en suthin's happened, ende lake's dead, en we's seen its ghos'; we's seen it twiste, en dat'sproof. De desert's ha'nted, it's ha'nted, sho; oh, Mars Tom, le''s gitouten it; I'd ruther die den have de night ketch us in it ag'in en deghos' er dat lake come a-mournin' aroun' us en we asleep en doan' know dedanger we's in."</p><p> "Ghost, you gander! It ain't anything but air and heat and thirstinesspasted together by a person's imagination. If I--gimme the glass!"</p><p> He grabbed it and begun to gaze off to the right.</p><p> "It's a flock of birds," he says. "It's getting toward sundown, andthey're making a bee-line across our track for somewheres. They meanbusiness--maybe they're going for food or water, or both. Let her go tostarboard!--Port your hellum! Hard down! There--ease up--steady, as yougo."</p><p> We shut down some of the power, so as not to outspeed them, and took outafter them. We went skimming along a quarter of a mile behind them, andwhen we had followed them an hour and a half and was getting prettydiscouraged, and was thirsty clean to unendurableness, Tom says:</p><p> "Take the glass, one of you, and see what that is, away ahead of thebirds."</p><p> Jim got the first glimpse, and slumped down on the locker sick. He wasmost crying, and says:</p><p> "She's dah ag'in, Mars Tom, she's dah ag'in, en I knows I's gwine to die,'case when a body sees a ghos' de third time, dat's what it means. Iwisht I'd never come in dis balloon, dat I does."</p><p> He wouldn't look no more, and what he said made me afraid, too, because Iknowed it was true, for that has always been the way with ghosts; so thenI wouldn't look any more, either. Both of us begged Tom to turn off andgo some other way, but he wouldn't, and said we was ignorantsuperstitious blatherskites. Yes, and he'll git come up with, one ofthese days, I says to myself, insulting ghosts that way. They'll stand itfor a while, maybe, but they won't stand it always, for anybody thatknows about ghosts knows how easy they are hurt, and how revengeful theyare.</p><p> So we was all quiet and still, Jim and me being scared, and Tom busy. Byand by Tom fetched the balloon to a standstill, and says:</p><p> "NOW get up and look, you sapheads."</p><p> We done it, and there was the sure-enough water right under us!--clear,and blue, and cool, and deep, and wavy with the breeze, the loveliestsight that ever was. And all about it was grassy banks, and flowers, andshady groves of big trees, looped together with vines, and all looking sopeaceful and comfortable--enough to make a body cry, it was sobeautiful.</p><p> Jim DID cry, and rip and dance and carry on, he was so thankful and outof his mind for joy. It was my watch, so I had to stay by the works, butTom and Jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece, and fetched me up alot, and I've tasted a many a good thing in my life, but nothing thatever begun with that water.</p><p> Then we went down and had a swim, and then Tom came up and spelled me,and me and Jim had a swim, and then Jim spelled Tom, and me and Tom had afoot-race and a boxing-mill, and I don't reckon I ever had such a goodtime in my life. It warn't so very hot, because it was close on toevening, and we hadn't any clothes on, anyway. Clothes is well enough inschool, and in towns, and at balls, too, but there ain't no sense in themwhen there ain't no civilization nor other kinds of bothers and fussinessaround.</p><p> "Lions a-comin'!--lions! Quick, Mars Tom! Jump for yo' life, Huck!"</p><p> Oh, and didn't we! We never stopped for clothes, but waltzed up theladder just so. Jim lost his head straight off--he always done itwhenever he got excited and scared; and so now, 'stead of just easing theladder up from the ground a little, so the animals couldn't reach it, heturned on a raft of power, and we went whizzing up and was dangling inthe sky before he got his wits together and seen what a foolish thing hewas doing. Then he stopped her, but he had clean forgot what to do next;so there we was, so high that the lions looked like pups, and we wasdrifting off on the wind.</p><p> But Tom he shinned up and went for the works and begun to slant her down,and back toward the lake, where the animals was gathering like acamp-meeting, and I judged he had lost HIS head, too; for he knowed I wastoo scared to climb, and did he want to dump me among the tigers andthings?</p><p> But no, his head was level, he knowed what he was about. He swooped downto within thirty or forty feet of the lake, and stopped right over thecenter, and sung out:</p><p> "Leggo, and drop!"</p><p> I done it, and shot down, feet first, and seemed to go about a miletoward the bottom; and when I come up, he says:</p><p> "Now lay on your back and float till you're rested and got your pluckback, then I'll dip the ladder in the water and you can climb aboard."</p><p> I done it. Now that was ever so smart in Tom, because if he had startedoff somewheres else to drop down on the sand, the menagerie would 'a'come along, too, and might 'a' kept us hunting a safe place till I gottuckered out and fell.</p><p> And all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out the clothes, andtrying to divide them up so there would be some for all, but there was amisunderstanding about it somewheres, on account of some of them tryingto hog more than their share; so there was another insurrection, and younever see anything like it in the world. There must 'a' been fifty ofthem, all mixed up together, snorting and roaring and snapping and bitingand tearing, legs and tails in the air, and you couldn't tell which waswhich, and the sand and fur a-flying. And when they got done, some wasdead and some was limping off crippled, and the rest was setting aroundon the battlefield, some of them licking their sore places and the otherslooking up at us and seemed to be kind of inviting us to come down andhave some fun, but which we didn't want any.</p><p> As for the clothes, they warn't any, any more. Every last rag of them wasinside of the animals; and not agreeing with them very well, I don'treckon, for there was considerable many brass buttons on them, and therewas knives in the pockets, too, and smoking tobacco, and nails and chalkand marbles and fishhooks and things. But I wasn't caring. All that wasbothering me was, that all we had now was the professor's clothes, a bigenough assortment, but not suitable to go into company with, if we cameacross any, because the britches was as long as tunnels, and the coatsand things according. Still, there was everything a tailor needed, andJim was a kind of jack legged tailor, and he allowed he could soon trim asuit or two down for us that would answer.</p><h2>Chapter 9</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> TOM DISCOURSES ON THE DESERT </p><p><img alt="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 9" title="Tom Sawyer Abroad, chapter 9" itemprop="image" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/tom-sawyer-abroad/frontis-9.jpg" style="max-width:600px; float:right; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3480355153" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> STILL, we thought we would drop down there a minute, but on anothererrand. Most of the professor's cargo of food was put up in cans, in thenew way that somebody had just invented; the rest was fresh. When youfetch Missouri beefsteak to the Great Sahara, you want to be particularand stay up in the coolish weather. So we reckoned we would drop downinto the lion market and see how we could make out there.</p><p> We hauled in the ladder and dropped down till we was just above the reachof the animals, then we let down a rope with a slip-knot in it and hauledup a dead lion, a small tender one, then yanked up a cub tiger. We had tokeep the congregation off with the revolver, or they would 'a' took ahand in the proceedings and helped.</p><p> We carved off a supply from both, and saved the skins, and hove the restoverboard. Then we baited some of the professor's hooks with the freshmeat and went a-fishing. We stood over the lake just a convenientdistance above the water, and catched a lot of the nicest fish you eversee. It was a most amazing good supper we had; lion steak, tiger steak,fried fish, and hot corn-pone. I don't want nothing better than that.</p><p> We had some fruit to finish off with. We got it out of the top of amonstrous tall tree. It was a very slim tree that hadn't a branch on itfrom the bottom plumb to the top, and there it bursted out like afeather-duster. It was a pa'm-tree, of course; anybody knows a pa'm-treethe minute he see it, by the pictures. We went for cocoanuts in this one,but there warn't none. There was only big loose bunches of things likeoversized grapes, and Tom allowed they was dates, because he said theyanswered the description in the Arabian Nights and the other books. Ofcourse they mightn't be, and they might be poison; so we had to wait aspell, and watch and see if the birds et them. They done it; so we doneit, too, and they was most amazing good.</p><p> By this time monstrous big birds begun to come and settle on the deadanimals. They was plucky creturs; they would tackle one end of a lionthat was being gnawed at the other end by another lion. If the lion drovethe bird away, it didn't do no good; he was back again the minute thelion was busy.</p><p> The big birds come out of every part of the sky--you could make them outwith the glass while they was still so far away you couldn't see themwith your naked eye. Tom said the birds didn't find out the meat wasthere by the smell; they had to find it out by seeing it. Oh, but ain'tthat an eye for you! Tom said at the distance of five mile a patch ofdead lions couldn't look any bigger than a person's finger-nail, and hecouldn't imagine how the birds could notice such a little thing so faroff.</p><p> It was strange and unnatural to see lion eat lion, and we thought maybethey warn't kin. But Jim said that didn't make no difference. He said ahog was fond of her own children, and so was a spider, and he reckonedmaybe a lion was pretty near as unprincipled though maybe not quite. Hethought likely a lion wouldn't eat his own father, if he knowed which washim, but reckoned he would eat his brother-in-law if he was uncommonhungry, and eat his mother-in-law any time. But RECKONING don't settlenothing. You can reckon till the cows come home, but that don't fetch youto no decision. So we give it up and let it drop.</p><p> Generly it was very still in the Desert nights, but this time there wasmusic. A lot of other animals come to dinner; sneaking yelpers that Tomallowed was jackals, and roached-backed ones that he said was hyenas; andall the whole biling of them kept up a racket all the time. They made apicture in the moonlight that was more different than any picture I eversee. We had a line out and made fast to the top of a tree, and didn'tstand no watch, but all turned in and slept; but I was up two or threetimes to look down at the animals and hear the music. It was like havinga front seat at a menagerie for nothing, which I hadn't ever had before,and so it seemed foolish to sleep and not make the most of it; I mightn'tever have such a chance again.</p><p> We went a-fishing again in the early dawn, and then lazied around all dayin the deep shade on an island, taking turn about to watch and see thatnone of the animals come a-snooping around there after erronorts fordinner. We was going to leave the next day, but couldn't, it was toolovely.</p><p> The day after, when we rose up toward the sky and sailed off eastward, welooked back and watched that place till it warn't nothing but just aspeck in the Desert, and I tell you it was like saying good-bye to afriend that you ain't ever going to see any more.</p><p> Jim was thinking to himself, and at last he says:</p><p> "Mars Tom, we's mos' to de end er de Desert now, I speck."</p><p> "Why?"</p><p> "Well, hit stan' to reason we is. You knows how long we's been a-skimmin'over it. Mus' be mos' out o' san'. Hit's a wonder to me dat it's hilt outas long as it has."</p><p> "Shucks, there's plenty sand, you needn't worry."</p><p> "Oh, I ain't a-worryin', Mars Tom, only wonderin', dat's all. De Lord'sgot plenty san', I ain't doubtin' dat; but nemmine, He ain't gwyne toWAS'E it jist on dat account; en I allows dat dis Desert's plenty bigenough now, jist de way she is, en you can't spread her out no mo' 'doutwas'in' san'."</p><p> "Oh, go 'long! we ain't much more than fairly STARTED across this Desertyet. The United States is a pretty big country, ain't it? Ain't it,Huck?"</p><p> "Yes," I says, "there ain't no bigger one, I don't reckon."</p><p> "Well," he says, "this Desert is about the shape of the United States,and if you was to lay it down on top of the United States, it would coverthe land of the free out of sight like a blanket. There'd be a littlecorner sticking out, up at Maine and away up northwest, and Floridasticking out like a turtle's tail, and that's all. We've took Californiaaway from the Mexicans two or three years ago, so that part of thePacific coast is ours now, and if you laid the Great Sahara down with heredge on the Pacific, she would cover the United States and stick out pastNew York six hundred miles into the Atlantic ocean."</p><p> I say:</p><p> "Good land! have you got the documents for that, Tom Sawyer?"</p><p> "Yes, and they're right here, and I've been studying them. You can lookfor yourself. From New York to the Pacific is 2,600 miles. From one endof the Great Desert to the other is 3,200. The United States contains3,600,000 square miles, the Desert contains 4,162,000. With the Desert'sbulk you could cover up every last inch of the United States, and inunder where the edges projected out, you could tuck England, Scotland,Ireland, France, Denmark, and all Germany. Yes, sir, you could hide thehome of the brave and all of them countries clean out of sight under theGreat Sahara, and you would still have 2,000 square miles of sand left."</p><p> "Well," I says, "it clean beats me. Why, Tom, it shows that the Lord tookas much pains makin' this Desert as makin' the United States and all themother countries."</p><p> Jim says: "Huck, dat don' stan' to reason. I reckon dis Desert wa'n'tmade at all. Now you take en look at it like dis--you look at it, and seeef I's right. What's a desert good for? 'Taint good for nuthin'. Deyain't no way to make it pay. Hain't dat so, Huck?"</p><p> "Yes, I reckon."</p><p> "Hain't it so, Mars Tom?"</p><p> "I guess so. Go on."</p><p> "Ef a thing ain't no good, it's made in vain, ain't it?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "NOW, den! Do de Lord make anything in vain? You answer me dat."</p><p> "Well--no, He don't."</p><p> "Den how come He make a desert?"</p><p> "Well, go on. How DID He come to make it?"</p><p> "Mars Tom, I b'lieve it uz jes like when you's buildin' a house; dey'sallays a lot o' truck en rubbish lef' over. What does you do wid it?Doan' you take en k'yart it off en dump it into a ole vacant back lot?'Course. Now, den, it's my opinion hit was jes like dat--dat de GreatSahara warn't made at all, she jes HAPPEN'."</p><p> I said it was a real good argument, and I believed it was the best oneJim ever made. Tom he said the same, but said the trouble about argumentsis, they ain't nothing but THEORIES, after all, and theories don't provenothing, they only give you a place to rest on, a spell, when you aretuckered out butting around and around trying to find out something thereain't no way TO find out. And he says:</p><p> "There's another trouble about theories: there's always a hole in themsomewheres, sure, if you look close enough. It's just so with this one ofJim's. Look what billions and billions of stars there is. How does itcome that there was just exactly enough star-stuff, and none left over?How does it come there ain't no sand-pile up there?"</p><p> But Jim was fixed for him and says:</p><p> "What's de Milky Way?--dat's what I want to know. What's de Milky Way?Answer me dat!"</p><p> In my opinion it was just a sockdologer. It's only an opinion, it's onlyMY opinion and others may think different; but I said it then and I standto it now--it was a sockdologer. And moreover, besides, it landed TomSawyer. He couldn't say a word. He had that stunned look of a personthat's been shot in the back with a kag of nails. All he said was, as forpeople like me and Jim, he'd just as soon have intellectual intercoursewith a catfish. But anybody can say that--and I notice they always do,when somebody has fetched them a lifter. Tom Sawyer was tired of that endof the subject.</p><p> So we got back to talking about the size of the Desert again, and themore we compared it with this and that and t'other thing, the more noblerand bigger and grander it got to look right along. And so, hunting amongthe figgers, Tom found, by and by, that it was just the same size as theEmpire of China. Then he showed us the spread the Empire of China made onthe map, and the room she took up in the world. Well, it was wonderful tothink of, and I says:</p><p> "Why, I've heard talk about this Desert plenty of times, but I neverknowed before how important she was."</p><p> Then Tom says:</p><p> "Important! Sahara important! That's just the way with some people. If athing's big, it's important. That's all the sense they've got. All theycan see is SIZE. Why, look at England. It's the most important country inthe world; and yet you could put it in China's vest-pocket; and not onlythat, but you'd have the dickens's own time to find it again the nexttime you wanted it. And look at Russia. It spreads all around andeverywhere, and yet ain't no more important in this world than RhodeIsland is, and hasn't got half as much in it that's worth saving."</p><p> Away off now we see a little hill, a-standing up just on the edge of theworld. Tom broke off his talk, and reached for a glass very much excited,and took a look, and says:</p><p> "That's it--it's the one I've been looking for, sure. If I'm right, it'sthe one the dervish took the man into and showed him all the treasures."</p><p> So we begun to gaze, and he begun to tell about it out of the ArabianNights.</p><h2>Chapter 10</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> THE TREASURE-HILL</p><p> TOM said it happened like this.</p><p> A dervish was stumping it along through the Desert, on foot, one blazinghot day, and he had come a thousand miles and was pretty poor, andhungry, and ornery and tired, and along about where we are now he runacross a camel-driver with a hundred camels, and asked him for some a'ms.But the cameldriver he asked to be excused. The dervish said:</p><p> "Don't you own these camels?"</p><p> "Yes, they're mine."</p><p> "Are you in debt?"</p><p> "Who--me? No."</p><p> "Well, a man that owns a hundred camels and ain't in debt is rich--andnot only rich, but very rich. Ain't it so?"</p><p> The camel-driver owned up that it was so. Then the dervish says:</p><p> "God has made you rich, and He has made me poor. He has His reasons, andthey are wise, blessed be His name. But He has willed that His rich shallhelp His poor, and you have turned away from me, your brother, in myneed, and He will remember this, and you will lose by it."</p><p> That made the camel-driver feel shaky, but all the same he was bornhoggish after money and didn't like to let go a cent; so he begun towhine and explain, and said times was hard, and although he had took afull freight down to Balsora and got a fat rate for it, he couldn't gitno return freight, and so he warn't making no great things out of histrip. So the dervish starts along again, and says:</p><p> "All right, if you want to take the risk; but I reckon you've made amistake this time, and missed a chance."</p><p> Of course the camel-driver wanted to know what kind of a chance he hadmissed, because maybe there was money in it; so he run after the dervish,and begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at last thedervish gave in, and says:</p><p> "Do you see that hill yonder? Well, in that hill is all the treasures ofthe earth, and I was looking around for a man with a particular good kindheart and a noble, generous disposition, because if I could find justthat man, I've got a kind of a salve I could put on his eyes and he couldsee the treasures and get them out."</p><p> So then the camel-driver was in a sweat; and he cried, and begged, andtook on, and went down on his knees, and said he was just that kind of aman, and said he could fetch a thousand people that would say he wasn'tever described so exact before.</p><p> "Well, then," says the dervish, "all right. If we load the hundredcamels, can I have half of them?"</p><p> The driver was so glad he couldn't hardly hold in, and says:</p><p> "Now you're shouting."</p><p> So they shook hands on the bargain, and the dervish got out his box andrubbed the salve on the driver's right eye, and the hill opened and hewent in, and there, sure enough, was piles and piles of gold and jewelssparkling like all the stars in heaven had fell down.</p><p> So him and the dervish laid into it, and they loaded every camel till hecouldn't carry no more; then they said good-bye, and each of them startedoff with his fifty. But pretty soon the camel-driver come a-running andovertook the dervish and says:</p><p> "You ain't in society, you know, and you don't really need all you'vegot. Won't you be good, and let me have ten of your camels?"</p><p> "Well," the dervish says, "I don't know but what you say is reasonableenough."</p><p> So he done it, and they separated and the dervish started off again withhis forty. But pretty soon here comes the camel-driver bawling after himagain, and whines and slobbers around and begs another ten off of him,saying thirty camel loads of treasures was enough to see a dervishthrough, because they live very simple, you know, and don't keep house,but board around and give their note.</p><p> But that warn't the end yet. That ornery hound kept coming and comingtill he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred. Then hewas satisfied, and ever so grateful, and said he wouldn't ever forgit thedervish as long as he lived, and nobody hadn't been so good to himbefore, and liberal. So they shook hands good-bye, and separated andstarted off again.</p><p> But do you know, it warn't ten minutes till the camel-driver wasunsatisfied again--he was the lowdownest reptyle in seven counties--andhe come a-running again. And this time the thing he wanted was to get thedervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye.</p><p> "Why?" said the dervish.</p><p> "Oh, you know," says the driver.</p><p> "Know what?"</p><p> "Well, you can't fool me," says the driver. "You're trying to keep backsomething from me, you know it mighty well. You know, I reckon, that if Ihad the salve on the other eye I could see a lot more things that'svaluable. Come--please put it on."</p><p> The dervish says:</p><p> "I wasn't keeping anything back from you. I don't mind telling you whatwould happen if I put it on. You'd never see again. You'd be stone-blindthe rest of your days."</p><p> But do you know that beat wouldn't believe him. No, he begged and begged,and whined and cried, till at last the dervish opened his box and toldhim to put it on, if he wanted to. So the man done it, and sure enough hewas as blind as a bat in a minute.</p><p> Then the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him;and says:</p><p> "Good-bye--a man that's blind hain't got no use for jewelry."</p><p> And he cleared out with the hundred camels, and left that man to wanderaround poor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in theDesert.</p><p> Jim said he'd bet it was a lesson to him.</p><p> "Yes," Tom says, "and like a considerable many lessons a body gets. Theyain't no account, because the thing don't ever happen the same wayagain--and can't. The time Hen Scovil fell down the chimbly and crippledhis back for life, everybody said it would be a lesson to him. What kindof a lesson? How was he going to use it? He couldn't climb chimblies nomore, and he hadn't no more backs to break."</p><p> "All de same, Mars Tom, dey IS sich a thing as learnin' by expe'ence. DeGood Book say de burnt chile shun de fire."</p><p> "Well, I ain't denying that a thing's a lesson if it's a thing that canhappen twice just the same way. There's lots of such things, and THEYeducate a person, that's what Uncle Abner always said; but there's fortyMILLION lots of the other kind--the kind that don't happen the same waytwice--and they ain't no real use, they ain't no more instructive thanthe small-pox. When you've got it, it ain't no good to find out you oughtto been vaccinated, and it ain't no good to git vaccinated afterward,because the small-pox don't come but once. But, on the other hand, UncleAbner said that the person that had took a bull by the tail once hadlearnt sixty or seventy times as much as a person that hadn't, and said aperson that started in to carry a cat home by the tail was gittingknowledge that was always going to be useful to him, and warn't evergoing to grow dim or doubtful. But I can tell you, Jim, Uncle Abner wasdown on them people that's all the time trying to dig a lesson out ofeverything that happens, no matter whether--"</p><p> But Jim was asleep. Tom looked kind of ashamed, because you know a personalways feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the otherperson is admiring, and that other person goes to sleep that way. Ofcourse he oughtn't to go to sleep, because it's shabby; but the finer aperson talks the certainer it is to make you sleep, and so when you cometo look at it it ain't nobody's fault in particular; both of them's toblame.</p><p> Jim begun to snore--soft and blubbery at first, then a long rasp, then astronger one, then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last watersucking down the plug-hole of a bath-tub, then the same with more powerto it, and some big coughs and snorts flung in, the way a cow does thatis choking to death; and when the person has got to that point he is athis level best, and can wake up a man that is in the next block with adipperful of loddanum in him, but can't wake himself up although all thatawful noise of his'n ain't but three inches from his own ears. And thatis the curiosest thing in the world, seems to me. But you rake a match tolight the candle, and that little bit of a noise will fetch him. I wish Iknowed what was the reason of that, but there don't seem to be no way tofind out. Now there was Jim alarming the whole Desert, and yanking theanimals out, for miles and miles around, to see what in the nation wasgoing on up there; there warn't nobody nor nothing that was as close tothe noise as HE was, and yet he was the only cretur that wasn't disturbedby it. We yelled at him and whooped at him, it never done no good; butthe first time there come a little wee noise that wasn't of a usual kindit woke him up. No, sir, I've thought it all over, and so has Tom, andthere ain't no way to find out why a snorer can't hear himself snore.</p><p> Jim said he hadn't been asleep; he just shut his eyes so he could listenbetter.</p><p> Tom said nobody warn't accusing him.</p><p> That made him look like he wished he hadn't said anything. And he wantedto git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse thecamel-driver, just the way a person does when he has got catched insomething and wants to take it out of somebody else. He let into thecamel-driver the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him; andhe praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had to agree withhim there, too. But Tom says:</p><p> "I ain't so sure. You call that dervish so dreadful liberal and good andunselfish, but I don't quite see it. He didn't hunt up another poordervish, did he? No, he didn't. If he was so unselfish, why didn't he goin there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along and besatisfied? No, sir, the person he was hunting for was a man with ahundred camels. He wanted to get away with all the treasure he could."</p><p> "Why, Mars Tom, he was willin' to divide, fair and square; he only struckfor fifty camels."</p><p> "Because he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by."</p><p> "Mars Tom, he TOLE de man de truck would make him bline."</p><p> "Yes, because he knowed the man's character. It was just the kind of aman he was hunting for--a man that never believes in anybody's word oranybody's honorableness, because he ain't got none of his own. I reckonthere's lots of people like that dervish. They swindle, right and left,but they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself. They keepinside of the letter of the law all the time, and there ain't no way togit hold of them. THEY don't put the salve on--oh, no, that would besin; but they know how to fool YOU into putting it on, then it's you thatblinds yourself. I reckon the dervish and the camel-driver was just apair--a fine, smart, brainy rascal, and a dull, coarse, ignorant one, butboth of them rascals, just the same."</p><p> "Mars Tom, does you reckon dey's any o' dat kind o' salve in de worl'now?"</p><p> "Yes, Uncle Abner says there is. He says they've got it in New York, andthey put it on country people's eyes and show them all the railroads inthe world, and they go in and git them, and then when they rub the salveon the other eye the other man bids them goodbye and goes off with theirrailroads. Here's the treasure-hill now. Lower away!"</p><p> We landed, but it warn't as interesting as I thought it was going to be,because we couldn't find the place where they went in to git thetreasure. Still, it was plenty interesting enough, just to see the merehill itself where such a wonderful thing happened. Jim said he wou'dn't'a' missed it for three dollars, and I felt the same way.</p><p> And to me and Jim, as wonderful a thing as any was the way Tom could comeinto a strange big country like this and go straight and find a littlehump like that and tell it in a minute from a million other humps thatwas almost just like it, and nothing to help him but only his ownlearning and his own natural smartness. We talked and talked it overtogether, but couldn't make out how he done it. He had the best head onhim I ever see; and all he lacked was age, to make a name for himselfequal to Captain Kidd or George Washington. I bet you it would 'a'crowded either of THEM to find that hill, with all their gifts, but itwarn't nothing to Tom Sawyer; he went across Sahara and put his finger onit as easy as you could pick a nigger out of a bunch of angels.</p><p> We found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of saltaround the edges, and loaded up the lion's skin and the tiger's so asthey would keep till Jim could tan them.</p><p> </p><h2>Chapter 11</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> THE SAND-STORM</p><p> WE went a-fooling along for a day or two, and then just as the full moonwas touching the ground on the other side of the desert, we see a stringof little black figgers moving across its big silver face. You could seethem as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink. It was anothercaravan. We cooled down our speed and tagged along after it, just to havecompany, though it warn't going our way. It was a rattler, that caravan,and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the sun comea-streaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of the camelson the gold sand like a thousand grand-daddy-long-legses marching inprocession. We never went very near it, because we knowed better now thanto act like that and scare people's camels and break up their caravans.It was the gayest outfit you ever see, for rich clothes and nobby style.Some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries, the first we ever see, and verytall, and they go plunging along like they was on stilts, and they rockthe man that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinnerconsiderable, I bet you, but they make noble good time, and a camel ain'tnowheres with them for speed.</p><p> The caravan camped, during the middle part of the day, and then startedagain about the middle of the afternoon. Before long the sun begun tolook very curious. First it kind of turned to brass, and then to copper,and after that it begun to look like a blood-red ball, and the air gothot and close, and pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up andlooked thick and foggy, but fiery and dreadful--like it looks through apiece of red glass, you know. We looked down and see a big confusiongoing on in the caravan, and a rushing every which way like they wasscared; and then they all flopped down flat in the sand and laid thereperfectly still.</p><p> Pretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing widewall, and reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun, and itwas coming like the nation, too. Then a little faint breeze struck us,and then it come harder, and grains of sand begun to sift against ourfaces and sting like fire, and Tom sung out:</p><p> "It's a sand-storm--turn your backs to it!"</p><p> We done it; and in another minute it was blowing a gale, and the sandbeat against us by the shovelful, and the air was so thick with it wecouldn't see a thing. In five minutes the boat was level full, and we wassetting on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand, and only our headsout and could hardly breathe.</p><p> Then the storm thinned, and we see that monstrous wall go a-sailing offacross the desert, awful to look at, I tell you. We dug ourselves out andlooked down, and where the caravan was before there wasn't anything butjust the sand ocean now, and all still and quiet. All them people andcamels was smothered and dead and buried--buried under ten foot of sand,we reckoned, and Tom allowed it might be years before the wind uncoveredthem, and all that time their friends wouldn't ever know what become ofthat caravan. Tom said:</p><p> "NOW we know what it was that happened to the people we got the swordsand pistols from."</p><p> Yes, sir, that was just it. It was as plain as day now. They got buriedin a sand-storm, and the wild animals couldn't get at them, and the windnever uncovered them again until they was dried to leather and warn't fitto eat. It seemed to me we had felt as sorry for them poor people as aperson could for anybody, and as mournful, too, but we was mistaken; thislast caravan's death went harder with us, a good deal harder. You see,the others was total strangers, and we never got to feeling acquaintedwith them at all, except, maybe, a little with the man that was watchingthe girl, but it was different with this last caravan. We was huvveringaround them a whole night and 'most a whole day, and had got to feelingreal friendly with them, and acquainted. I have found out that thereain't no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them thanto travel with them. Just so with these. We kind of liked them from thestart, and traveling with them put on the finisher. The longer wetraveled with them, and the more we got used to their ways, the betterand better we liked them, and the gladder and gladder we was that we runacross them. We had come to know some of them so well that we called themby name when we was talking about them, and soon got so familiar andsociable that we even dropped the Miss and Mister and just used theirplain names without any handle, and it did not seem unpolite, but justthe right thing. Of course, it wasn't their own names, but names we givethem. There was Mr. Elexander Robinson and Miss Adaline Robinson, andColonel Jacob McDougal and Miss Harryet McDougal, and Judge JeremiahButler and young Bushrod Butler, and these was big chiefs mostly thatwore splendid great turbans and simmeters, and dressed like the GrandMogul, and their families. But as soon as we come to know them good, andlike them very much, it warn't Mister, nor Judge, nor nothing, any more,but only Elleck, and Addy, and Jake, and Hattie, and Jerry, and Buck, andso on.</p><p> And you know the more you join in with people in their joys and theirsorrows, the more nearer and dearer they come to be to you. Now we warn'tcold and indifferent, the way most travelers is, we was right downfriendly and sociable, and took a chance in everything that was going,and the caravan could depend on us to be on hand every time, it didn'tmake no difference what it was.</p><p> When they camped, we camped right over them, ten or twelve hundred feetup in the air. When they et a meal, we et ourn, and it made it ever somuch home-liker to have their company. When they had a wedding thatnight, and Buck and Addy got married, we got ourselves up in the verystarchiest of the professor's duds for the blow-out, and when they dancedwe jined in and shook a foot up there.</p><p> But it is sorrow and trouble that brings you the nearest, and it was afuneral that done it with us. It was next morning, just in the stilldawn. We didn't know the diseased, and he warn't in our set, but thatnever made no difference; he belonged to the caravan, and that wasenough, and there warn't no more sincerer tears shed over him than theones we dripped on him from up there eleven hundred foot on high.</p><p> Yes, parting with this caravan was much more bitterer than it was to partwith them others, which was comparative strangers, and been dead so long,anyway. We had knowed these in their lives, and was fond of them, too,and now to have death snatch them from right before our faces while wewas looking, and leave us so lonesome and friendless in the middle ofthat big desert, it did hurt so, and we wished we mightn't ever make anymore friends on that voyage if we was going to lose them again like that.</p><p> We couldn't keep from talking about them, and they was all the timecoming up in our memory, and looking just the way they looked when we wasall alive and happy together. We could see the line marching, and theshiny spearheads a-winking in the sun; we could see the dromedarieslumbering along; we could see the wedding and the funeral; and moreoftener than anything else we could see them praying, because they don'tallow nothing to prevent that; whenever the call come, several times aday, they would stop right there, and stand up and face to the east, andlift back their heads, and spread out their arms and begin, and four orfive times they would go down on their knees, and then fall forward andtouch their forehead to the ground.</p><p> Well, it warn't good to go on talking about them, lovely as they was intheir life, and dear to us in their life and death both, because itdidn't do no good, and made us too down-hearted. Jim allowed he was goingto live as good a life as he could, so he could see them again in abetter world; and Tom kept still and didn't tell him they was onlyMohammedans; it warn't no use to disappoint him, he was feeling badenough just as it was.</p><p> When we woke up next morning we was feeling a little cheerfuller, and hadhad a most powerful good sleep, because sand is the comfortablest bedthere is, and I don't see why people that can afford it don't have itmore. And it's terrible good ballast, too; I never see the balloon sosteady before.</p><p> Tom allowed we had twenty tons of it, and wondered what we better do withit; it was good sand, and it didn't seem good sense to throw it away. Jimsays:</p><p> "Mars Tom, can't we tote it back home en sell it? How long'll it take?"</p><p> "Depends on the way we go."</p><p> "Well, sah, she's wuth a quarter of a dollar a load at home, en I reckonwe's got as much as twenty loads, hain't we? How much would dat be?"</p><p> "Five dollars."</p><p> "By jings, Mars Tom, le's shove for home right on de spot! Hit's more'n adollar en a half apiece, hain't it?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "Well, ef dat ain't makin' money de easiest ever I struck! She jes'rained in--never cos' us a lick o' work. Le's mosey right along, MarsTom."</p><p> But Tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy and excited he neverheard him. Pretty soon he says:</p><p> "Five dollars--sho! Look here, this sand's worth--worth--why, it's worthno end of money."</p><p> "How is dat, Mars Tom? Go on, honey, go on!"</p><p> "Well, the minute people knows it's genuwyne sand from the genuwyneDesert of Sahara, they'll just be in a perfect state of mind to git holdof some of it to keep on the what-not in a vial with a label on it for acuriosity. All we got to do is to put it up in vials and float around allover the United States and peddle them out at ten cents apiece. We've gotall of ten thousand dollars' worth of sand in this boat."</p><p> Me and Jim went all to pieces with joy, and begun to shoutwhoopjamboreehoo, and Tom says:</p><p> "And we can keep on coming back and fetching sand, and coming back andfetching more sand, and just keep it a-going till we've carted this wholeDesert over there and sold it out; and there ain't ever going to be anyopposition, either, because we'll take out a patent."</p><p> "My goodness," I says, "we'll be as rich as Creosote, won't we, Tom?"</p><p> "Yes--Creesus, you mean. Why, that dervish was hunting in that littlehill for the treasures of the earth, and didn't know he was walking overthe real ones for a thousand miles. He was blinder than he made thedriver."</p><p> "Mars Tom, how much is we gwyne to be worth?"</p><p> "Well, I don't know yet. It's got to be ciphered, and it ain't theeasiest job to do, either, because it's over four million square miles ofsand at ten cents a vial."</p><p> Jim was awful excited, but this faded it out considerable, and he shookhis head and says:</p><p> "Mars Tom, we can't 'ford all dem vials--a king couldn't. We better nottry to take de whole Desert, Mars Tom, de vials gwyne to bust us, sho'."</p><p> Tom's excitement died out, too, now, and I reckoned it was on account ofthe vials, but it wasn't. He set there thinking, and got bluer and bluer,and at last he says:</p><p> "Boys, it won't work; we got to give it up."</p><p> "Why, Tom?"</p><p> "On account of the duties."</p><p> I couldn't make nothing out of that, neither could Jim. I says:</p><p> "What IS our duty, Tom? Because if we can't git around it, why can't wejust DO it? People often has to."</p><p> But he says:</p><p> "Oh, it ain't that kind of duty. The kind I mean is a tax. Whenever youstrike a frontier--that's the border of a country, you know--you find acustom-house there, and the gov'ment officers comes and rummages amongyour things and charges a big tax, which they call a duty because it'stheir duty to bust you if they can, and if you don't pay the duty they'llhog your sand. They call it confiscating, but that don't deceive nobody,it's just hogging, and that's all it is. Now if we try to carry this sandhome the way we're pointed now, we got to climb fences till we gittired--just frontier after frontier--Egypt, Arabia, Hindostan, and soon, and they'll all whack on a duty, and so you see, easy enough, weCAN'T go THAT road."</p><p> "Why, Tom," I says, "we can sail right over their old frontiers; how areTHEY going to stop us?"</p><p> He looked sorrowful at me, and says, very grave:</p><p> "Huck Finn, do you think that would be honest?"</p><p> I hate them kind of interruptions. I never said nothing, and he went on:</p><p> "Well, we're shut off the other way, too. If we go back the way we'vecome, there's the New York custom-house, and that is worse than all ofthem others put together, on account of the kind of cargo we've got."</p><p> "Why?"</p><p> "Well, they can't raise Sahara sand in America, of course, and when theycan't raise a thing there, the duty is fourteen hundred thousand percent. on it if you try to fetch it in from where they do raise it."</p><p> "There ain't no sense in that, Tom Sawyer."</p><p> "Who said there WAS? What do you talk to me like that for, Huck Finn? Youwait till I say a thing's got sense in it before you go to accusing me ofsaying it."</p><p> "All right, consider me crying about it, and sorry. Go on."</p><p> Jim says:</p><p> "Mars Tom, do dey jam dat duty onto everything we can't raise in America,en don't make no 'stinction 'twix' anything?"</p><p> "Yes, that's what they do."</p><p> "Mars Tom, ain't de blessin' o' de Lord de mos' valuable thing dey is?"</p><p> "Yes, it is."</p><p> "Don't de preacher stan' up in de pulpit en call it down on de people?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "Whah do it come from?"</p><p> "From heaven."</p><p> "Yassir! you's jes' right, 'deed you is, honey--it come from heaven, endat's a foreign country. NOW, den! do dey put a tax on dat blessin'?"</p><p> "No, they don't."</p><p> "Course dey don't; en so it stan' to reason dat you's mistaken, Mars Tom.Dey wouldn't put de tax on po' truck like san', dat everybody ain't'bleeged to have, en leave it off'n de bes' thing dey is, which nobodycan't git along widout."</p><p> Tom Sawyer was stumped; he see Jim had got him where he couldn't budge.He tried to wiggle out by saying they had FORGOT to put on that tax, butthey'd be sure to remember about it, next session of Congress, and thenthey'd put it on, but that was a poor lame come-off, and he knowed it. Hesaid there warn't nothing foreign that warn't taxed but just that one,and so they couldn't be consistent without taxing it, and to beconsistent was the first law of politics. So he stuck to it that they'dleft it out unintentional and would be certain to do their best to fix itbefore they got caught and laughed at.</p><p> But I didn't feel no more interest in such things, as long as we couldn'tgit our sand through, and it made me low-spirited, and Jim the same. Tomhe tried to cheer us up by saying he would think up another speculationfor us that would be just as good as this one and better, but it didn'tdo no good, we didn't believe there was any as big as this. It was mightyhard; such a little while ago we was so rich, and could 'a' bought acountry and started a kingdom and been celebrated and happy, and now wewas so poor and ornery again, and had our sand left on our hands. Thesand was looking so lovely before, just like gold and di'monds, and thefeel of it was so soft and so silky and nice, but now I couldn't bear thesight of it, it made me sick to look at it, and I knowed I wouldn't everfeel comfortable again till we got shut of it, and I didn't have it thereno more to remind us of what we had been and what we had got degradeddown to. The others was feeling the same way about it that I was. Iknowed it, because they cheered up so, the minute I says le's throw thistruck overboard.</p><p> Well, it was going to be work, you know, and pretty solid work, too; soTom he divided it up according to fairness and strength. He said me andhim would clear out a fifth apiece of the sand, and Jim three-fifths. Jimhe didn't quite like that arrangement. He says:</p><p> "Course I's de stronges', en I's willin' to do a share accordin', but byjings you's kinder pilin' it onto ole Jim, Mars Tom, hain't you?"</p><p> "Well, I didn't think so, Jim, but you try your hand at fixing it, andlet's see."</p><p> So Jim reckoned it wouldn't be no more than fair if me and Tom done aTENTH apiece. Tom he turned his back to git room and be private, and thenhe smole a smile that spread around and covered the whole Sahara to thewestward, back to the Atlantic edge of it where we come from. Then heturned around again and said it was a good enough arrangement, and we wassatisfied if Jim was. Jim said he was.</p><p> So then Tom measured off our two-tenths in the bow and left the rest forJim, and it surprised Jim a good deal to see how much difference therewas and what a raging lot of sand his share come to, and said he waspowerful glad now that he had spoke up in time and got the firstarrangement altered, for he said that even the way it was now, there wasmore sand than enjoyment in his end of the contract, he believed.</p><p> Then we laid into it. It was mighty hot work, and tough; so hot we had tomove up into cooler weather or we couldn't 'a' stood it. Me and Tom tookturn about, and one worked while t'other rested, but there warn't nobodyto spell poor old Jim, and he made all that part of Africa damp, hesweated so. We couldn't work good, we was so full of laugh, and Jim hekept fretting and wanting to know what tickled us so, and we had to keepmaking up things to account for it, and they was pretty poor inventions,but they done well enough, Jim didn't see through them. At last when wegot done we was 'most dead, but not with work but with laughing. By andby Jim was 'most dead, too, but: it was with work; then we took turns andspelled him, and he was as thankfull as he could be, and would set on thegunnel and swab the sweat, and heave and pant, and say how good we was toa poor old nigger, and he wouldn't ever forgit us. He was always thegratefulest nigger I ever see, for any little thing you done for him. Hewas only nigger outside; inside he was as white as you be.</p><h2>Chapter 12</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> JIM STANDING SIEGE</p><p> THE next few meals was pretty sandy, but that don't make no differencewhen you are hungry; and when you ain't it ain't no satisfaction to eat,anyway, and so a little grit in the meat ain't no particular drawback, asfar as I can see.</p><p> Then we struck the east end of the Desert at last, sailing on a northeastcourse. Away off on the edge of the sand, in a soft pinky light, we seethree little sharp roofs like tents, and Tom says:</p><p> "It's the pyramids of Egypt."</p><p> It made my heart fairly jump. You see, I had seen a many and a many apicture of them, and heard tell about them a hundred times, and yet tocome on them all of a sudden, that way, and find they was REAL, 'stead ofimaginations, 'most knocked the breath out of me with surprise. It's acurious thing, that the more you hear about a grand and big and bullything or person, the more it kind of dreamies out, as you may say, andgets to be a big dim wavery figger made out of moonshine and nothingsolid to it. It's just so with George Washington, and the same with thempyramids.</p><p> And moreover, besides, the thing they always said about them seemed to meto be stretchers. There was a feller come to the Sunday-school once, andhad a picture of them, and made a speech, and said the biggest pyramidcovered thirteen acres, and was most five hundred foot high, just a steepmountain, all built out of hunks of stone as big as a bureau, and laid upin perfectly regular layers, like stair-steps. Thirteen acres, you see,for just one building; it's a farm. If it hadn't been in Sunday-school, Iwould 'a' judged it was a lie; and outside I was certain of it. And hesaid there was a hole in the pyramid, and you could go in there withcandles, and go ever so far up a long slanting tunnel, and come to alarge room in the stomach of that stone mountain, and there you wouldfind a big stone chest with a king in it, four thousand years old. I saidto myself, then, if that ain't a lie I will eat that king if they willfetch him, for even Methusalem warn't that old, and nobody claims it.</p><p> As we come a little nearer we see the yaller sand come to an end in along straight edge like a blanket, and on to it was joined, edge to edge,a wide country of bright green, with a snaky stripe crooking through it,and Tom said it was the Nile. It made my heart jump again, for the Nilewas another thing that wasn't real to me. Now I can tell you one thingwhich is dead certain: if you will fool along over three thousand milesof yaller sand, all glimmering with heat so that it makes your eyes waterto look at it, and you've been a considerable part of a week doing it,the green country will look so like home and heaven to you that it willmake your eyes water AGAIN.</p><p> It was just so with me, and the same with Jim.</p><p> And when Jim got so he could believe it WAS the land of Egypt he waslooking at, he wouldn't enter it standing up, but got down on his kneesand took off his hat, because he said it wasn't fitten' for a humble poornigger to come any other way where such men had been as Moses and Josephand Pharaoh and the other prophets. He was a Presbyterian, and had a mostdeep respect for Moses which was a Presbyterian, too, he said. He was allstirred up, and says:</p><p> "Hit's de lan' of Egypt, de lan' of Egypt, en I's 'lowed to look at itwid my own eyes! En dah's de river dat was turn' to blood, en I's lookingat de very same groun' whah de plagues was, en de lice, en de frogs, ende locus', en de hail, en whah dey marked de door-pos', en de angel o' deLord come by in de darkness o' de night en slew de fust-born in all delan' o' Egypt. Ole Jim ain't worthy to see dis day!"</p><p> And then he just broke down and cried, he was so thankful. So between himand Tom there was talk enough, Jim being excited because the land was sofull of history--Joseph and his brethren, Moses in the bulrushers, Jacobcoming down into Egypt to buy corn, the silver cup in the sack, and allthem interesting things; and Tom just as excited too, because the landwas so full of history that was in HIS line, about Noureddin, andBedreddin, and such like monstrous giants, that made Jim's wool rise, anda raft of other Arabian Nights folks, which the half of them never donethe things they let on they done, I don't believe.</p><p> Then we struck a disappointment, for one of them early morning fogsstarted up, and it warn't no use to sail over the top of it, because wewould go by Egypt, sure, so we judged it was best to set her by compassstraight for the place where the pyramids was gitting blurred and blottedout, and then drop low and skin along pretty close to the ground and keepa sharp lookout. Tom took the hellum, I stood by to let go the anchor,and Jim he straddled the bow to dig through the fog with his eyes andwatch out for danger ahead. We went along a steady gait, but not veryfast, and the fog got solider and solider, so solid that Jim looked dimand ragged and smoky through it. It was awful still, and we talked lowand was anxious. Now and then Jim would say:</p><p> "Highst her a p'int, Mars Tom, highst her!" and up she would skip, a footor two, and we would slide right over a flat-roofed mud cabin, withpeople that had been asleep on it just beginning to turn out and gap andstretch; and once when a feller was clear up on his hind legs so he couldgap and stretch better, we took him a blip in the back and knocked himoff. By and by, after about an hour, and everything dead still and wea-straining our ears for sounds and holding our breath, the fog thinned alittle, very sudden, and Jim sung out in an awful scare:</p><p> "Oh, for de lan's sake, set her back, Mars Tom, here's de biggest giantouten de 'Rabian Nights a-comin' for us!" and he went over backwards inthe boat.</p><p> Tom slammed on the back-action, and as we slowed to a standstill a man'sface as big as our house at home looked in over the gunnel, same as ahouse looks out of its windows, and I laid down and died. I must 'a' beenclear dead and gone for as much as a minute or more; then I come to, andTom had hitched a boat-hook on to the lower lip of the giant and washolding the balloon steady with it whilst he canted his head back and gota good long look up at that awful face.</p><p> Jim was on his knees with his hands clasped, gazing up at the thing in abegging way, and working his lips, but not getting anything out. I tookonly just a glimpse, and was fading out again, but Tom says:</p><p> "He ain't alive, you fools; it's the Sphinx!"</p><p> I never see Tom look so little and like a fly; but that was because thegiant's head was so big and awful. Awful, yes, so it was, but notdreadful any more, because you could see it was a noble face, and kind ofsad, and not thinking about you, but about other things and larger. Itwas stone, reddish stone, and its nose and ears battered, and that giveit an abused look, and you felt sorrier for it for that.</p><p> We stood off a piece, and sailed around it and over it, and it was justgrand. It was a man's head, or maybe a woman's, on a tiger's body ahundred and twenty-five foot long, and there was a dear little templebetween its front paws. All but the head used to be under the sand, forhundreds of years, maybe thousands, but they had just lately dug the sandaway and found that little temple. It took a power of sand to bury thatcretur; most as much as it would to bury a steamboat, I reckon.</p><p> We landed Jim on top of the head, with an American flag to protect him,it being a foreign land; then we sailed off to this and that and t'otherdistance, to git what Tom called effects and perspectives andproportions, and Jim he done the best he could, striking all thedifferent kinds of attitudes and positions he could study up, butstanding on his head and working his legs the way a frog does was thebest. The further we got away, the littler Jim got, and the grander theSphinx got, till at last it was only a clothespin on a dome, as you mightsay. That's the way perspective brings out the correct proportions, Tomsaid; he said Julus Cesar's niggers didn't know how big he was, they wastoo close to him.</p><p> Then we sailed off further and further, till we couldn't see Jim at allany more, and then that great figger was at its noblest, a-gazing outover the Nile Valley so still and solemn and lonesome, and all the littleshabby huts and things that was scattered about it clean disappeared andgone, and nothing around it now but a soft wide spread of yaller velvet,which was the sand.</p><p> That was the right place to stop, and we done it. We set there a-lookingand a-thinking for a half an hour, nobody a-saying anything, for it madeus feel quiet and kind of solemn to remember it had been looking overthat valley just that same way, and thinking its awful thoughts all toitself for thousands of years, and nobody can't find out what they are tothis day.</p><p> At last I took up the glass and see some little black things a-caperingaround on that velvet carpet, and some more a-climbing up the cretur'sback, and then I see two or three wee puffs of white smoke, and told Tomto look. He done it, and says:</p><p> "They're bugs. No--hold on; they--why, I believe they're men. Yes, it'smen--men and horses both. They're hauling a long ladder up onto theSphinx's back--now ain't that odd? And now they're trying to lean it upa--there's some more puffs of smoke--it's guns! Huck, they're after Jim."</p><p> We clapped on the power, and went for them a-biling. We was there in notime, and come a-whizzing down amongst them, and they broke and scatteredevery which way, and some that was climbing the ladder after Jim let goall holts and fell. We soared up and found him laying on top of the headpanting and most tuckered out, partly from howling for help and partlyfrom scare. He had been standing a siege a long time--a week, HE said,but it warn't so, it only just seemed so to him because they was crowdinghim so. They had shot at him, and rained the bullets all around him, buthe warn't hit, and when they found he wouldn't stand up and the bulletscouldn't git at him when he was laying down, they went for the ladder,and then he knowed it was all up with him if we didn't come pretty quick.Tom was very indignant, and asked him why he didn't show the flag andcommand them to GIT, in the name of the United States. Jim said he doneit, but they never paid no attention. Tom said he would have this thinglooked into at Washington, and says:</p><p> "You'll see that they'll have to apologize for insulting the flag, andpay an indemnity, too, on top of it even if they git off THAT easy."</p><p> Jim says:</p><p> "What's an indemnity, Mars Tom?"</p><p> "It's cash, that's what it is."</p><p> "Who gits it, Mars Tom?"</p><p> "Why, WE do."</p><p> "En who gits de apology?"</p><p> "The United States. Or, we can take whichever we please. We can take theapology, if we want to, and let the gov'ment take the money."</p><p> "How much money will it be, Mars Tom?"</p><p> "Well, in an aggravated case like this one, it will be at least threedollars apiece, and I don't know but more."</p><p> "Well, den, we'll take de money, Mars Tom, blame de 'pology. Hain't datyo' notion, too? En hain't it yourn, Huck?"</p><p> We talked it over a little and allowed that that was as good a way asany, so we agreed to take the money. It was a new business to me, and Iasked Tom if countries always apologized when they had done wrong, and hesays:</p><p> "Yes; the little ones does."</p><p> We was sailing around examining the pyramids, you know, and now we soaredup and roosted on the flat top of the biggest one, and found it was justlike what the man said in the Sunday-school. It was like four pairs ofstairs that starts broad at the bottom and slants up and comes togetherin a point at the top, only these stair-steps couldn't be clumb the wayyou climb other stairs; no, for each step was as high as your chin, andyou have to be boosted up from behind. The two other pyramids warn't faraway, and the people moving about on the sand between looked like bugscrawling, we was so high above them.</p><p> Tom he couldn't hold himself he was so worked up with gladness andastonishment to be in such a celebrated place, and he just drippedhistory from every pore, seemed to me. He said he couldn't scarcelybelieve he was standing on the very identical spot the prince flew fromon the Bronze Horse. It was in the Arabian Night times, he said. Somebodygive the prince a bronze horse with a peg in its shoulder, and he couldgit on him and fly through the air like a bird, and go all over theworld, and steer it by turning the peg, and fly high or low and landwherever he wanted to.</p><p> When he got done telling it there was one of them uncomfortable silencesthat comes, you know, when a person has been telling a whopper and youfeel sorry for him and wish you could think of some way to change thesubject and let him down easy, but git stuck and don't see no way, andbefore you can pull your mind together and DO something, that silence hasgot in and spread itself and done the business. I was embarrassed, Jim hewas embarrassed, and neither of us couldn't say a word. Well, Tom heglowered at me a minute, and says:</p><p> "Come, out with it. What do you think?"</p><p> I says:</p><p> "Tom Sawyer, YOU don't believe that, yourself."</p><p> "What's the reason I don't? What's to hender me?"</p><p> "There's one thing to hender you: it couldn't happen, that's all."</p><p> "What's the reason it couldn't happen?"</p><p> "You tell me the reason it COULD happen."</p><p> "This balloon is a good enough reason it could happen, I should reckon."</p><p> "WHY is it?"</p><p> "WHY is it? I never saw such an idiot. Ain't this balloon and the bronzehorse the same thing under different names?"</p><p> "No, they're not. One is a balloon and the other's a horse. It's verydifferent. Next you'll be saying a house and a cow is the same thing."</p><p> "By Jackson, Huck's got him ag'in! Dey ain't no wigglin' outer dat!"</p><p> "Shut your head, Jim; you don't know what you're talking about. And Huckdon't. Look here, Huck, I'll make it plain to you, so you can understand.You see, it ain't the mere FORM that's got anything to do with theirbeing similar or unsimilar, it's the PRINCIPLE involved; and theprinciple is the same in both. Don't you see, now?"</p><p> I turned it over in my mind, and says:</p><p> "Tom, it ain't no use. Principles is all very well, but they don't gitaround that one big fact, that the thing that a balloon can do ain't nosort of proof of what a horse can do."</p><p> "Shucks, Huck, you don't get the idea at all. Now look here aminute--it's perfectly plain. Don't we fly through the air?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "Very well. Don't we fly high or fly low, just as we please?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "Don't we steer whichever way we want to?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "And don't we land when and where we please?"</p><p> "Yes."</p><p> "How do we move the balloon and steer it?"</p><p> "By touching the buttons."</p><p> "NOW I reckon the thing is clear to you at last. In the other case themoving and steering was done by turning a peg. We touch a button, theprince turned a peg. There ain't an atom of difference, you see. I knowedI could git it through your head if I stuck to it long enough."</p><p> He felt so happy he begun to whistle. But me and Jim was silent, so hebroke off surprised, and says:</p><p> "Looky here, Huck Finn, don't you see it YET?"</p><p> I says:</p><p> "Tom Sawyer, I want to ask you some questions."</p><p> "Go ahead," he says, and I see Jim chirk up to listen.</p><p> "As I understand it, the whole thing is in the buttons and the peg--therest ain't of no consequence. A button is one shape, a peg is anothershape, but that ain't any matter?"</p><p> "No, that ain't any matter, as long as they've both got the same power."</p><p> "All right, then. What is the power that's in a candle and in a match?"</p><p> "It's the fire."</p><p> "It's the same in both, then?"</p><p> "Yes, just the same in both."</p><p> "All right. Suppose I set fire to a carpenter shop with a match, whatwill happen to that carpenter shop?"</p><p> "She'll burn up."</p><p> "And suppose I set fire to this pyramid with a candle--will she burn up?"</p><p> "Of course she won't."</p><p> "All right. Now the fire's the same, both times. WHY does the shop burn,and the pyramid don't?"</p><p> "Because the pyramid CAN'T burn."</p><p> "Aha! and A HORSE CAN'T FLY!"</p><p> "My lan', ef Huck ain't got him ag'in! Huck's landed him high en dry distime, I tell you! Hit's de smartes' trap I ever see a body walk inter--enef I--"</p><p> But Jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling and couldn't go on, andTom was that mad to see how neat I had floored him, and turned his ownargument ag'in him and knocked him all to rags and flinders with it, thatall he could manage to say was that whenever he heard me and Jim try toargue it made him ashamed of the human race. I never said nothing; I wasfeeling pretty well satisfied. When I have got the best of a person thatway, it ain't my way to go around crowing about it the way some peopledoes, for I consider that if I was in his place I wouldn't wish him tocrow over me. It's better to be generous, that's what I think.</p><h2>Chapter 13</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> GOING FOR TOM'S PIPE:</p><p> BY AND BY we left Jim to float around up there in the neighborhood of thepyramids, and we clumb down to the hole where you go into the tunnel, andwent in with some Arabs and candles, and away in there in the middle ofthe pyramid we found a room and a big stone box in it where they used tokeep that king, just as the man in the Sunday-school said; but he wasgone, now; somebody had got him. But I didn't take no interest in theplace, because there could be ghosts there, of course; not fresh ones,but I don't like no kind.</p><p> So then we come out and got some little donkeys and rode a piece, andthen went in a boat another piece, and then more donkeys, and got toCairo; and all the way the road was as smooth and beautiful a road asever I see, and had tall date-pa'ms on both sides, and naked childreneverywhere, and the men was as red as copper, and fine and strong andhandsome. And the city was a curiosity. Such narrow streets--why, theywere just lanes, and crowded with people with turbans, and women withveils, and everybody rigged out in blazing bright clothes and all sortsof colors, and you wondered how the camels and the people got by eachother in such narrow little cracks, but they done it--a perfect jam, yousee, and everybody noisy. The stores warn't big enough to turn around in,but you didn't have to go in; the storekeeper sat tailor fashion on hiscounter, smoking his snaky long pipe, and had his things where he couldreach them to sell, and he was just as good as in the street, for thecamel-loads brushed him as they went by.</p><p> Now and then a grand person flew by in a carriage with fancy dressed menrunning and yelling in front of it and whacking anybody with a long rodthat didn't get out of the way. And by and by along comes the Sultanriding horseback at the head of a procession, and fairly took your breathaway his clothes was so splendid; and everybody fell flat and laid on hisstomach while he went by. I forgot, but a feller helped me to remember.He was one that had a rod and run in front.</p><p> There was churches, but they don't know enough to keep Sunday; they keepFriday and break the Sabbath. You have to take off your shoes when you goin. There was crowds of men and boys in the church, setting in groups onthe stone floor and making no end of noise--getting their lessons byheart, Tom said, out of the Koran, which they think is a Bible, andpeople that knows better knows enough to not let on. I never see such abig church in my life before, and most awful high, it was; it made youdizzy to look up; our village church at home ain't a circumstance to it;if you was to put it in there, people would think it was a drygoods box.</p><p> What I wanted to see was a dervish, because I was interested in dervisheson accounts of the one that played the trick on the camel-driver. So wefound a lot in a kind of a church, and they called themselves WhirlingDervishes; and they did whirl, too. I never see anything like it. Theyhad tall sugar-loaf hats on, and linen petticoats; and they spun and spunand spun, round and round like tops, and the petticoats stood out on aslant, and it was the prettiest thing I ever see, and made me drunk tolook at it. They was all Moslems, Tom said, and when I asked him what aMoslem was, he said it was a person that wasn't a Presbyterian. So thereis plenty of them in Missouri, though I didn't know it before.</p><p> We didn't see half there was to see in Cairo, because Tom was in such asweat to hunt out places that was celebrated in history. We had a mosttiresome time to find the granary where Joseph stored up the grain beforethe famine, and when we found it it warn't worth much to look at, beingsuch an old tumble-down wreck; but Tom was satisfied, and made more fussover it than I would make if I stuck a nail in my foot. How he ever foundthat place was too many for me. We passed as much as forty just like itbefore we come to it, and any of them would 'a' done for me, but none butjust the right one would suit him; I never see anybody so particular asTom Sawyer. The minute he struck the right one he reconnized it as easyas I would reconnize my other shirt if I had one, but how he done it hecouldn't any more tell than he could fly; he said so himself.</p><p> Then we hunted a long time for the house where the boy lived that learnedthe cadi how to try the case of the old olives and the new ones, and saidit was out of the Arabian Nights, and he would tell me and Jim about itwhen he got time. Well, we hunted and hunted till I was ready to drop,and I wanted Tom to give it up and come next day and git somebody thatknowed the town and could talk Missourian and could go straight to theplace; but no, he wanted to find it himself, and nothing else wouldanswer. So on we went. Then at last the remarkablest thing happened Iever see. The house was gone--gone hundreds of years ago--every last ragof it gone but just one mud brick. Now a person wouldn't ever believethat a backwoods Missouri boy that hadn't ever been in that town beforecould go and hunt that place over and find that brick, but Tom Sawyerdone it. I know he done it, because I see him do it. I was right by hisvery side at the time, and see him see the brick and see him reconnizeit. Well, I says to myself, how DOES he do it? Is it knowledge, or is itinstink?</p><p> Now there's the facts, just as they happened: let everybody explain ittheir own way. I've ciphered over it a good deal, and it's my opinionthat some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink. Thereason is this: Tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum withhis name on it and the facts when he went home, and I slipped it out andput another brick considerable like it in its place, and he didn't knowthe difference--but there was a difference, you see. I think that settlesit--it's mostly instink, not knowledge. Instink tells him where the exactPLACE is for the brick to be in, and so he reconnizes it by the placeit's in, not by the look of the brick. If it was knowledge, not instink,he would know the brick again by the look of it the next time he seenit--which he didn't. So it shows that for all the brag you hear aboutknowledge being such a wonderful thing, instink is worth forty of it forreal unerringness. Jim says the same.</p><p> When we got back Jim dropped down and took us in, and there was a youngman there with a red skullcap and tassel on and a beautiful silk jacketand baggy trousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in it thatcould talk English and wanted to hire to us as guide and take us to Meccaand Medina and Central Africa and everywheres for a half a dollar a dayand his keep, and we hired him and left, and piled on the power, and bythe time we was through dinner we was over the place where the Israelitescrossed the Red Sea when Pharaoh tried to overtake them and was caught bythe waters. We stopped, then, and had a good look at the place, and itdone Jim good to see it. He said he could see it all, now, just the wayit happened; he could see the Israelites walking along between the wallsof water, and the Egyptians coming, from away off yonder, hurrying allthey could, and see them start in as the Israelites went out, and thenwhen they was all in, see the walls tumble together and drown the lastman of them. Then we piled on the power again and rushed away andhuvvered over Mount Sinai, and saw the place where Moses broke the tablesof stone, and where the children of Israel camped in the plain andworshiped the golden calf, and it was all just as interesting as couldbe, and the guide knowed every place as well as I knowed the village athome.</p><p> But we had an accident, now, and it fetched all the plans to astandstill. Tom's old ornery corn-cob pipe had got so old and swelled andwarped that she couldn't hold together any longer, notwithstanding thestrings and bandages, but caved in and went to pieces. Tom he didn't knowWHAT to do. The professor's pipe wouldn't answer; it warn't anything buta mershum, and a person that's got used to a cob pipe knows it lays along ways over all the other pipes in this world, and you can't git himto smoke any other. He wouldn't take mine, I couldn't persuade him. Sothere he was.</p><p> He thought it over, and said we must scour around and see if we couldroust out one in Egypt or Arabia or around in some of these countries,but the guide said no, it warn't no use, they didn't have them. So Tomwas pretty glum for a little while, then he chirked up and said he'd gotthe idea and knowed what to do. He says:</p><p> "I've got another corn-cob pipe, and it's a prime one, too, and nearlynew. It's laying on the rafter that's right over the kitchen stove athome in the village. Jim, you and the guide will go and get it, and meand Huck will camp here on Mount Sinai till you come back."</p><p> "But, Mars Tom, we couldn't ever find de village. I could find de pipe,'case I knows de kitchen, but my lan', we can't ever find de village, nurSent Louis, nur none o' dem places. We don't know de way, Mars Tom."</p><p> That was a fact, and it stumped Tom for a minute. Then he said:</p><p> "Looky here, it can be done, sure; and I'll tell you how. You set yourcompass and sail west as straight as a dart, till you find the UnitedStates. It ain't any trouble, because it's the first land you'll strikethe other side of the Atlantic. If it's daytime when you strike it, bulgeright on, straight west from the upper part of the Florida coast, and inan hour and three quarters you'll hit the mouth of the Mississippi--atthe speed that I'm going to send you. You'll be so high up in the airthat the earth will be curved considerable--sorter like a washbowl turnedupside down--and you'll see a raft of rivers crawling around every whichway, long before you get there, and you can pick out the Mississippiwithout any trouble. Then you can follow the river north nearly, an hourand three quarters, till you see the Ohio come in; then you want to looksharp, because you're getting near. Away up to your left you'll seeanother thread coming in--that's the Missouri and is a little above St.Louis. You'll come down low then, so as you can examine the villages asyou spin along. You'll pass about twenty-five in the next fifteenminutes, and you'll recognize ours when you see it--and if you don't, youcan yell down and ask."</p><p> "Ef it's dat easy, Mars Tom, I reckon we kin do it--yassir, I knows wekin."</p><p> The guide was sure of it, too, and thought that he could learn to standhis watch in a little while.</p><p> "Jim can learn you the whole thing in a half an hour," Tom said. "Thisballoon's as easy to manage as a canoe."</p><p> Tom got out the chart and marked out the course and measured it, andsays:</p><p> "To go back west is the shortest way, you see. It's only about seventhousand miles. If you went east, and so on around, it's over twice asfar." Then he says to the guide, "I want you both to watch the tell-taleall through the watches, and whenever it don't mark three hundred milesan hour, you go higher or drop lower till you find a storm-current that'sgoing your way. There's a hundred miles an hour in this old thing withoutany wind to help. There's two-hundred-mile gales to be found, any timeyou want to hunt for them."</p><p> "We'll hunt for them, sir."</p><p> "See that you do. Sometimes you may have to go up a couple of miles, andit'll be p'ison cold, but most of the time you'll find your storm a gooddeal lower. If you can only strike a cyclone--that's the ticket for you!You'll see by the professor's books that they travel west in theselatitudes; and they travel low, too."</p><p> Then he ciphered on the time, and says--</p><p> "Seven thousand miles, three hundred miles an hour--you can make the tripin a day--twenty-four hours. This is Thursday; you'll be back hereSaturday afternoon. Come, now, hustle out some blankets and food andbooks and things for me and Huck, and you can start right along. Thereain't no occasion to fool around--I want a smoke, and the quicker youfetch that pipe the better."</p><p> All hands jumped for the things, and in eight minutes our things was outand the balloon was ready for America. So we shook hands good-bye, andTom gave his last orders:</p><p> "It's 10 minutes to 2 P.M. now, Mount Sinai time. In 24 hours you'll behome, and it'll be 6 to-morrow morning, village time. When you strike thevillage, land a little back of the top of the hill, in the woods, out ofsight; then you rush down, Jim, and shove these letters in thepost-office, and if you see anybody stirring, pull your slouch down overyour face so they won't know you. Then you go and slip in the back way tothe kitchen and git the pipe, and lay this piece of paper on the kitchentable, and put something on it to hold it, and then slide out and gitaway, and don't let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you, nor nobody else.Then you jump for the balloon and shove for Mount Sinai three hundredmiles an hour. You won't have lost more than an hour. You'll start backat 7 or 8 A.M., village time, and be here in 24 hours, arriving at 2 or 3P.M., Mount Sinai time."</p><p> Tom he read the piece of paper to us. He had wrote on it:</p><p> "THURSDAY AFTERNOON. Tom Sawyer the Erro-nort sends his love to Aunt Polly from Mount Sinai where the Ark was, and so does Huck Finn, and she will get it to-morrow morning half-past six." *</p><p> [* This misplacing of the Ark is probably Huck's error, notTom's.--M.T.]</p><p> "That'll make her eyes bulge out and the tears come," he says. Then hesays:</p><p> "Stand by! One--two--three--away you go!"</p><p> And away she DID go! Why, she seemed to whiz out of sight in a second.</p><p> Then we found a most comfortable cave that looked out over the whole bigplain, and there we camped to wait for the pipe.</p><p> The balloon come hack all right, and brung the pipe; but Aunt Polly hadcatched Jim when he was getting it, and anybody can guess what happened:she sent for Tom. So Jim he says:</p><p> "Mars Tom, she's out on de porch wid her eye sot on de sky a-layin' foryou, en she say she ain't gwyne to budge from dah tell she gits hold ofyou. Dey's gwyne to be trouble, Mars Tom, 'deed dey is."</p><p> So then we shoved for home, and not feeling very gay, neither.</p><p> END.</p>

<p>As down Mount Emerald at eve I came,<br> The mountain moon went all the way with me.<br> Backward I looked, to see the heights aflame<br> With a pale light that glimmered eerily.<br> <br> A little lad undid the rustic latch<br> As hand in hand your cottage we did gain,<br> Where green limp tendrils at our cloaks did catch,<br> And dim bamboos o'erhung a shadowy lane.<br> <br> Gaily I cried, "Here may we rest our fill!"<br> Then choicest wines we quaffed; and cheerily<br> "The Wind among the Pines" we sang, until<br> A few faint stars hung in the Galaxy.<br> <br> Merry were you, my friend: and drunk was I,<br> Blissfully letting all the world go by. <br></p>

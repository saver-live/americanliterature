<p>NOW up and down the siding brown<br> The great black crows are flyin’,<br> And down below the spur, I know,<br> Another ‘milker’s’ dyin’;<br> The crops have withered from the ground,<br> The tank’s clay bed is glarin’,<br> But from my heart no tear nor sound,<br> For I have gone past carin’—<br> Past worryin’ or carin’,<br> Past feelin’ aught or carin’;<br> But from my heart no tear nor sound,<br> For I have gone past carin’.<br> <br></p>
<p>Through Death and Trouble, turn about,<br> Through hopeless desolation,<br> Through flood and fever, fire and drought,<br> And slavery and starvation;<br> Through childbirth, sickness, hurt, and blight,<br> And nervousness an’ scarin’,<br> Through bein’ left alone at night,<br> I’ve got to be past carin’.<br> Past botherin’ or carin’,<br> Past feelin’ and past carin’;<br> Through city cheats and neighbours’ spite,<br> I’ve come to be past carin’.<br> <br></p>
<p>Our first child took, in days like these,<br> A cruel week in dyin’,<br> All day upon her father’s knees,<br> Or on my poor breast lyin’;<br> The tears we shed—the prayers we said<br> Were awful, wild—despairin’!<br> I’ve pulled three through, and buried two<br> Since then—and I’m past carin’.<br> I’ve grown to be past carin’,<br> Past worryin’ and wearin’;<br> I’ve pulled three through and buried two<br> Since then, and I’m past carin’.<br> <br></p>
<p>’Twas ten years first, then came the worst,<br> All for a dusty clearin’,<br> I thought, I thought my heart would burst<br> When first my man went shearin’;<br> He’s drovin’ in the great North-west,<br> I don’t know how he’s farin’;<br> For I, the one that loved him best,<br> Have grown to be past carin’.<br> I’ve grown to be past carin’<br> Past lookin’ for or carin’;<br> The girl that waited long ago,<br> Has lived to be past carin’.<br> <br></p>
<p>My eyes are dry, I cannot cry,<br> I’ve got no heart for breakin’,<br> But where it was in days gone by,<br> A dull and empty achin’.<br> My last boy ran away from me,<br> I know my temper’s wearin’,<br> But now I only wish to be<br> Beyond all signs of carin’.<br> Past wearyin’ or carin’,<br> Past feelin’ and despairin’;<br> And now I only wish to be<br> Beyond all signs of carin’.<br></p>

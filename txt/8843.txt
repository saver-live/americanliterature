<p>GREAT cities rise and have their fall; the brass<br> That held their glories moulders in its turn.<br> Hard granite rots like an uprooted weed,<br> And ever on the palimpsest of earth<br> Impatient Time rubs out the word he writ.<br> But one thing makes the years its pedestal,<br> Springs from the ashes of its pyre, and claps<br> A skyward wing above its epitaph--<br> The will of man willing immortal things.<br> <br> The ages are but baubles hung upon<br> The thread of some strong lives--and one slight wrist<br> May lift a century above the dust;<br> For Time,<br> The Sisyphean load of little lives,<br> Becomes the globe and sceptre of the great.<br> But who are these that, linking hand in hand,<br> Transmit across the twilight waste of years<br> The flying brightness of a kindled hour?<br> Not always, nor alone, the lives that search<br> How they may snatch a glory out of heaven<br> Or add a height to Babel; oftener they<br> That in the still fulfilment of each day's<br> Pacific order hold great deeds in leash,<br> That in the sober sheath of tranquil tasks<br> Hide the attempered blade of high emprise,<br> And leap like lightning to the clap of fate.<br> <br> So greatly gave he, nurturing 'gainst the call<br> Of one rare moment all the daily store<br> Of joy distilled from the acquitted task,<br> And that deliberate rashness which bespeaks<br> The pondered action passed into the blood;<br> So swift to harden purpose into deed<br> That, with the wind of ruin in his hair,<br> Soul sprang full-statured from the broken flesh,<br> And at one stroke he lived the whole of life,<br> Poured all in one libation to the truth,<br> A brimming flood whose drops shall overflow<br> On deserts of the soul long beaten down<br> By the brute hoof of habit, till they spring<br> In manifold upheaval to the sun.<br> <br> Call here no high artificer to raise<br> His wordy monument--such lives as these<br> Make death a dull misnomer and its pomp<br> An empty vesture. Let resounding lives<br> Re-echo splendidly through high-piled vaults<br> And make the grave their spokesman--such as he<br> Are as the hidden streams that, underground,<br> Sweeten the pastures for the grazing kine,<br> Or as spring airs that bring through prison bars<br> The scent of freedom; or a light that burns<br> Immutably across the shaken seas,<br> Forevermore by nameless hands renewed,<br> Where else were darkness and a glutted shore.</p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cat! who hast pass'd thy grand climacteric,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many mice and rats hast in thy days
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy'd? How many tit bits stolen? Gaze
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those bright languid segments green, and prick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those velvet ears, but pr'ythee do not stick
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy latent talons in me, and upraise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy gentle mew, and tell me all thy frays,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fish and mice, and rats and tender chick.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, look not down, nor lick thy dainty wrists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all thy wheezy asthma, and for all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy tail's tip is nick'd off, and though the fists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of many a maid have given thee many a maul,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still is that fur as soft, as when the lists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In youth thou enter'dest on glass bottled wall.
</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poets with whom I learned my trade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companions of the Cheshire Cheese,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heres an old story Ive re-made,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagining twould better please
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ears than stories now in fashion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you may think I waste my breath
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretending that there can be passion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has more life in it than death,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though at bottling of your wine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow-legged Goban had no say;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morals yours because its mine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cups went round at close of day,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not that how good stories run?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere within some hollow hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If books speak truth in Slievenamon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let that be, the gods were still
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleepy, having had their meal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smoky torches made a glare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On painted pillars, on a deal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fiddles and of flutes hung there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the ancient holy hands that brought them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From murmuring Murias, on cups,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Goban hammered them and wrought them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put his pattern round their tops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold the wine they buy of him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the juice that made them wise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those had lifted up the dim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imaginations of their eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one that was like woman made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before their sleepy eyelids ran
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trembling with her passion said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come out and dig for a dead man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whos burrowing somewhere in the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mock him to his face and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hollo him on with horse and hound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he is the worst of all dead men.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be dazed and terror struck,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we but saw in dreams that room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those wine-drenched eyes, and curse our luck
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That emptied all our days to come.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew a woman none could please,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she dreamed when but a child
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of men and women made like these;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after, when her blood ran wild,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had ravelled her own story out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, In two or in three years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need must marry some poor lout,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having said it burst in tears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since, tavern comrades, you have died,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe your images have stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere bone and muscle thrown aside,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that roomful or as good.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had to face your ends when young,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twas wine or women, or some curse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never made a poorer song
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you might have a heavier purse,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor gave loud service to a cause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you might have a troop of friends.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You kept the Muses sterner laws,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unrepenting faced your ends,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore earned the right, and yet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dowson and Johnson most I praise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To troop with those the worlds forgot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And copy their proud steady gaze.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Danish troop was driven out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the dawn and dusk, she said;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the event was long in doubt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the King of Irelands dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half the kings, before sundown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was accomplished.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murrough, the King of Irelands son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foot after foot was giving way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his best troops back to back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had perished there, but the Danes ran,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stricken with panic from the attack,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouting of an unseen man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And being thankful Murrough found,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led by a footsole dipped in blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had made prints upon the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where by old thorn trees that man stood;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though when he gazed here and there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had but gazed on thorn trees, spoke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the friend that seems but air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet could give so fine a stroke?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereon a young man met his eye,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who said, Because she held me in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her love, and would not have me die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock-nurtured Aoife took a pin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pushing it into my shirt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promised that for a pins sake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man should see to do me hurt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there its gone; I will not take
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortune that had been my shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, Kings son, what wounds you have.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twas roundly spoke, but when night came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had betrayed me to his grave,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he and the Kings son were dead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Id promised him two hundred years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when for all Id done or said,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these immortal eyes shed tears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He claimed his countrys need was most,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Id saved his life, yet for the sake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a new friend he has turned a ghost.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he care if my heart break?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call for spade and horse and hound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we may harry him. Thereon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cast herself upon the ground
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rent her clothes and made her moan:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are they faithless when their might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is from the holy shades that rove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey rock and the windy light?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should the faithfullest heart most love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bitter sweetness of false faces?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must the lasting love what passes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are the gods by men betrayed!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thereon every god stood up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slow smile and without sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stretching forth his arm and cup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where she moaned upon the ground,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly drenched her to the skin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she with Gobans wine adrip,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more remembering what had been,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stared at the gods with laughing lip.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have kept my faith, though faith was tried,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that rock-born, rock-wandering foot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the worlds altered since you died,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am in no good repute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the loud host before the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That think sword strokes were better meant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than lovers music, let that be,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the wandering foots content.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloomy and dark art thou, O chief of the mighty Omahas;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloomy and dark as the driving cloud, whose name thou hast taken!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapt in thy scarlet blanket, I see thee stalk through the city's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Narrow and populous streets, as once by the margin of rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalked those birds unknown, that have left us only their footprints.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, in a few short years, will remain of thy race but the footprints?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How canst thou walk these streets, who hast trod the green turf of the prairies!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How canst thou breathe this air, who hast breathed the sweet air of the mountains!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! 't is in vain that with lordly looks of disdain thou dost challenge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks of disdain in return, and question these walls and these pavements,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claiming the soil for thy hunting-grounds, while down-trodden millions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starve in the garrets of Europe, and cry from its caverns that they, too,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been created heirs of the earth, and claim its division!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back, then, back to thy woods in the regions west of the Wabash!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There as a monarch thou reignest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In autumn the leaves of the maple
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pave the floors of thy palace-halls with gold, and in summer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pine-trees waft through its chambers the odorous breath of their branches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There thou art strong and great, a hero, a tamer of horses!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There thou chasest the stately stag on the banks of the Elkhorn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or by the roar of the Running-Water, or where the Omaha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls thee, and leaps through the wild ravine like a brave of the Blackfeet!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark! what murmurs arise from the heart of those mountainous deserts?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the cry of the Foxes and Crows, or the mighty Behemoth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, unharmed, on his tusks once caught the bolts of the thunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now lurks in his lair to destroy the race of the red man?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far more fatal to thee and thy race than the Crows and the Foxes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far more fatal to thee and thy race than the tread of Behemoth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the big thunder-canoe, that steadily breasts the Missouri's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merciless current! and yonder, afar on the prairies, the camp-fires
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleam through the night; and the cloud of dust in the gray of the daybreak
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marks not the buffalo's track, nor the Mandan's dexterous horse-race;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a caravan, whitening the desert where dwell the Camanches!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha! how the breath of these Saxons and Celts, like the blast of the east-wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifts evermore to the west the scanty smokes of thy wigwams!

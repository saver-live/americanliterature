<p>I with my hair in its first fringe<br> Romped outside breaking flower-heads.<br> You galloped by on bamboo horses.<br> We juggled green plums round the well.<br> Living in Chang-kan village,<br> Two small people without guile.<br> <br> At fourteen I married you sir,<br> So bashful I could only hide,<br> My frowning face turned to the wall.<br> Called after - never looking back. <br> <br> Fifteen before I learnt to smile.<br> Yearned to be one with you forever.<br> You to be the Ever-Faithful.<br> I to not sit lonely, waiting.<br> <br> At sixteen you sir went away,<br> Through White King's Gorge, by Yen Rock's rapids,<br> When the Yangtze's at its highest,<br> Where the gibbons cried above you.<br> <br> Here by the door your last footprints,<br> Slowly growing green mosses,<br> So deep I cannot sweep them,<br> Leaves so thick from winds of autumn.<br> <br> September's yellow butterflies<br> Twine together in our west garden.<br> What I feel -- it hurts the heart.<br> Sadness makes my beauty vanish.<br> <br> When you come down from far places,<br> Please will you write me a letter?<br> As far as the farthest reaches,<br> I'll come out to welcome you. <br></p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were come into Faery's Court
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rang, no one at home, all gone to sport
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dance and kiss and love as faerys do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Faries be as human lovers true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the woods they were so lone and wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where even the Robin feels himself exil'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where the very books as if affraid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry along to some less magic shade.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No one at home'! the fretful princess cry'd
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And all for nothing such a dre[a]ry ride
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all for nothing my new diamond cross
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one to see my persian feathers toss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one to see my Ape, my Dwarf, my Fool
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or how I pace my Otaheitan mule.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ape, Dwarf and Fool why stand you gaping there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst the door open, quick, or I declare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll switch you soundly and in pieces tear.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf began to tremble and the Ape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star'd at the Fool, the Fool was all agape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess grasp'd her switch but just in time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf with piteous face began to rhyme.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O mighty Princess did you ne'er hear tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What your poor servants know but too too well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know you the three great crimes in faery land
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first alas! poor Dwarf I understand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a whipstock of a faery's wand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is snoring in their company
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next the last the direst of the three
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is making free when they are not at home.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a Prince, a baby prince, my doom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, I made a whipstock of a wand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My top has henceforth slept in faery land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a Prince the Fool, a grown up Prince
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has never been a King's son since
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell a snoring at a faery Ball
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your poor Ape was a Prince and he poor thing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ape, so pray your highness stay awhile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis sooth indeed we know it to our sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persist and you may be an ape tomorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Dwarf spake the Princess all for spite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peal'd the brown hazel twig to lilly white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clench'd her small teeth, and held her lips apart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try'd to look unconcerned with beating heart.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw her highness had made up her mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quaver'd like the reeds before the wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they had had it, but O happy chance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ape for very fear began to dance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grin'd as all his uglyness did ache,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She staid her vixen fingers for his sake
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so very ugly: then she took
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her pocket mirror and began to look
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First at herself and [then] at him and then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smil'd at her own beauteous face again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet for all this, for all her pretty face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took it in her head to see the place.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women gain little from experience
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either in Lovers, husbands or expense.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more their beauty the more fortune too
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty before the wide world never knew.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So each fair reasons, tho' it oft miscarries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought her pretty face would please the fa[e]ries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My darling Ape I wont whip you today
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me the Picklock sirrah and go play."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all three wept but counsel was as vain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As crying cup biddy to drops of rain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet lingeringly did the sad Ape forth draw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Picklock from the Pocket in his Jaw.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess took it and dismounting straight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trip'd in blue silver'd slippers to the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch'd the wards, the Door full courteously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened, she enter'd with her servants three.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again it clos'd and there was nothing seen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Mule grasing on the herbage green.

End of Canto xii.

Canto the xiii.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mule no sooner saw himself alone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than he prick'd up his Ears, and said 'well done!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least unhappy Prince I may be free,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more a Princess shall side saddle me
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O King of Othaiete, tho' a Mule
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Aye every inch a King', tho' 'Fortune's fool.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, for by what Mr. Dwarfy said
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not give a sixpence for her head.'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as he spake he trotted in high glee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the knotty side of an old Pollard tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rub'd his sides against the mossed bark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his Girths burst and left him naked stark
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except his Bridle, how get rid of that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buckled and tied with many a twist and plait.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last it struck him to pretend to sleep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the thievish Monkies down would creep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filch the unpleasant trammels quite away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner thought of than adown he lay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sham'd a good snore, the Monkey-men descended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whom they thought to injure they befriended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hung his Bridle on a topmost bough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of[f] he went run, trot, or anyhow,

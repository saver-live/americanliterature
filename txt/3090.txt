I been a having some hard traveling
I thought you knowed
I been a having some hard traveling
Way Down the road
I been a having some hard traveling
Hard rambling, hard gambling
I been a having some hard traveling, Lord.

I been a riding them fast rattlers
I thought you knowed
I been a riding them flat wheelers
Way down the road
I been a riding them blind passengers
Dead enders kickin' up cinders
I been a having some hard traveling, Lord.

I been a working in a hard rock tunnel
I thought you knowed
I been a leaning on a pressure drill
Way down the road
Hammer flyin, air hose suckin'
Six feet and mud I sure been a mucking
I been a having some hard traveling, Lord.

I been a working that Pittsburgh steel
I thought you knowed
I been a working that red hot slag
Way down the road
I been a blastin, I been a firin'
I been a duckin' red hot iron
I been a having some hard traveling, Lord.

I been hittin' some hard harvestin'
I thought you knowed
I been hitting some rough handling
Way down the road
Cut that wheat and stack that hay
Tryin' to make about a dollar a day
I been a having some hard traveling, Lord.

I been a layin' in a hard rock jail
I thought you knowed
I been a layin' out ninety days
Way down the road
Mean old judge he says to me
It's ninety days for vagrancy
I been a havin' some hard traveling, Lord.

I been a hittin' that Lincoln Highway
I thought you knowed
I been a hittin' that Sixty-Six
Way down the road
Heavy load and a worried mind
Lookin' for a woman
That's hard to find
I been a havin' some hard old traveling, Lord.

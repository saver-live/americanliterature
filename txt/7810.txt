<pre>I shall gather myself into my self again,
I shall take my scattered selves and make them one.
I shall fuse them into a polished crystal ball
Where I can see the moon and the flashing sun.

I Shall sit like a sibyl, hour after hour intent.
Watching the future come and the present go 
And the little shifting pictures of people rushing
In tiny self-importance to and fro.
</pre>

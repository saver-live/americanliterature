<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay, stay at home, my heart, and rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home-keeping hearts are happiest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those that wander they know not where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are full of trouble and full of care;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay at home is best.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary and homesick and distressed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wander east, they wander west,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are baffled and beaten and blown about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the winds of the wilderness of doubt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay at home is best.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then stay at home, my heart, and rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird is safest in its nest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er all that flutter their wings and fly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hawk is hovering in the sky;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay at home is best.

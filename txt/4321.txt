<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look into the chasms, and a shroud
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vapourous doth hide them, just so much I wist
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mankind do know of hell; I look o'erhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is sullen mist, even so much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mankind can tell of heaven; mist is spread
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the earth, beneath me, even such,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so vague is man's sight of himself!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the craggy stones beneath my feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus much I know that, a poor witless elf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tread on them, that all my eye doth meet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is mist and crag, not only on this height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the world of thought and mental might!

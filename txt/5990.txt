<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O little feet! that such long years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must wander on through hopes and fears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must ache and bleed beneath your load;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, nearer to the wayside inn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where toil shall cease and rest begin,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am weary, thinking of your road!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O little hands! that, weak or strong,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have still to serve or rule so long,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have still so long to give or ask;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, who so much with book and pen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have toiled among my fellow-men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am weary, thinking of your task.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O little hearts! that throb and beat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such impatient, feverish heat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such limitless and strong desires;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine that so long has glowed and burned,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With passions into ashes turned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now covers and conceals its fires.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O little souls! as pure and white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crystalline as rays of light
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct from heaven, their source divine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refracted through the mist of years,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How red my setting sun appears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How lurid looks this soul of mine!

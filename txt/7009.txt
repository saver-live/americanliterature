I think we can manage it.”</p><p>She broke the cookie into four pieces, and gave one piece to the littlest child.</p><p>“See!” she said. “This is a roast chicken, a Brown Bantam. It is just as brown and crispy as it can be, and there is cranberry sauce on one side, and on the other a little mountain of mashed potato; it must be a volcano, it smokes so. Do you see?”</p><p>“Yes!” said the littlest one; and his mouth went down in the middle and up at the corners.</p><p>The Play Angel gave a piece to the next child.</p><p>“Here,” she said, “is a little pie! Outside, as you see, it is brown and crusty, with a wreath of pastry leaves round the edge and ‘For You’ in the middle; but inside it is all chicken and ham and jelly and hard-boiled eggs. Did ever you see such a pie?”</p><p>“Never I did!” said the child.</p><p>“Now here,” said the Angel to the third child, “is a round cake. Look at it! the frosting is half an inch thick, with candied rose-leaves and angelica laid on in true-lovers’ knots; and inside there are chopped-up almonds, and raisins, and great slices of citron. It is the prettiest cake I ever saw, and the best.”</p><p>“So it is I did!” said the third child.</p><p>Then the Angel gave the last piece to the child whose nursery it was.</p><p>“My dear!” she said. “Just look! Here is an ice-cream rabbit. He is snow-white outside, with eyes of red barley sugar; see his ears, and his little snubby tail! but inside, I think you will find him pink. Now, when I clap my hands and count one, two, three, you must eat the feast all up. One—two—three!”</p><p>So the children ate the feast all up.</p><p>“There!” said the Angel. “Did ever you see such a grand feast?”</p><p>“No, never we did!” said all the four children together.</p><p>“And there are some crumbs left over,” said the Angel. “Come, and we will give them to the brother birds!”</p><p>“But you didn’t have any!” said the child whose nursery it was.</p><p>“Oh, yes!” said the Angel. “I had it all!”</p><p> </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>

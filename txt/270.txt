<p>All's as it was: the snowstorm's<br> Fine flakes wet the window pane,<br> And I myself am not new-born,<br> But a man came to me today.<br> <br> I asked: 'What do you wish?'<br> He said: 'To be with you in hell'.<br> Ilaughed: 'Ah, sadly,<br> No: perhaps you wish me ill.'<br> <br> But, his dry hand touched<br> A petal with a light caress:<br> 'Tell me, how they kiss you,<br> Tell me, how you kiss.'<br> <br> And his eyes, dully gazing,<br> Never lifted from my ring.<br> Not a single muscle shifting<br> Beneath that evil-glistening.<br> <br> O, I understand: to know, passionately<br> And intensely, is his delight,<br> That there's nothing that he needs,<br> And nothing I can deny.<br></p>

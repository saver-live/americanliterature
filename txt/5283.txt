<p>I am back from up the country—very sorry that I went—<br> Seeking for the Southern poets’ land whereon to pitch my tent;<br> I have lost a lot of idols, which were broken on the track,<br> Burnt a lot of fancy verses, and I’m glad that I am back.<br> Further out may be the pleasant scenes of which our poets boast,<br> But I think the country’s rather more inviting round the coast.<br> Anyway, I’ll stay at present at a boarding-house in town,<br> Drinking beer and lemon-squashes, taking baths and cooling down.<br> <br> ‘Sunny plains’! Great Scott!—those burning wastes of barren soil and sand<br> With their everlasting fences stretching out across the land!<br> Desolation where the crow is! Desert where the eagle flies,<br> Paddocks where the luny bullock starts and stares with reddened eyes;<br> Where, in clouds of dust enveloped, roasted bullock-drivers creep<br> Slowly past the sun-dried shepherd dragged behind his crawling sheep.<br> Stunted peak of granite gleaming, glaring like a molten mass<br> Turned from some infernal furnace on a plain devoid of grass.<br> <br> Miles and miles of thirsty gutters—strings of muddy water-holes<br> In the place of ‘shining rivers’—‘walled by cliffs and forest boles.’<br> Barren ridges, gullies, ridges! where the ever-madd’ning flies—<br> Fiercer than the plagues of Egypt—swarm about your blighted eyes!<br> Bush! where there is no horizon! where the buried bushman sees<br> Nothing—Nothing! but the sameness of the ragged, stunted trees!<br> Lonely hut where drought’s eternal, suffocating atmosphere<br> Where the God-forgotten hatter dreams of city life and beer.<br> <br> Treacherous tracks that trap the stranger, endless roads that gleam and glare,<br> Dark and evil-looking gullies, hiding secrets here and there!<br> Dull dumb flats and stony rises, where the toiling bullocks bake,<br> And the sinister ‘gohanna’, and the lizard, and the snake.<br> Land of day and night—no morning freshness, and no afternoon,<br> When the great white sun in rising bringeth summer heat in June.<br> Dismal country for the exile, when the shades begin to fall<br> From the sad heart-breaking sunset, to the new-chum worst of all.<br> <br> Dreary land in rainy weather, with the endless clouds that drift<br> O’er the bushman like a blanket that the Lord will never lift—<br> Dismal land when it is raining—growl of floods, and, oh! the woosh<br> Of the rain and wind together on the dark bed of the bush—<br> Ghastly fires in lonely humpies where the granite rocks are piled<br> In the rain-swept wildernesses that are wildest of the wild.<br> <br> Land where gaunt and haggard women live alone and work like men,<br> Till their husbands, gone a-droving, will return to them again:<br> Homes of men! if home had ever such a God-forgotten place,<br> Where the wild selector’s children fly before a stranger’s face.<br> Home of tragedy applauded by the dingoes’ dismal yell,<br> Heaven of the shanty-keeper—fitting fiend for such a hell—<br> And the wallaroos and wombats, and, of course, the curlew’s call—<br> And the lone sundowner tramping ever onward through it all!<br> <br> I am back from up the country, up the country where I went<br> Seeking for the Southern poets’ land whereon to pitch my tent;<br> I have shattered many idols out along the dusty track,<br> Burnt a lot of fancy verses—and I’m glad that I am back.<br> I believe the Southern poets’ dream will not be realised<br> Till the plains are irrigated and the land is humanised.<br> I intend to stay at present, as I said before, in town<br> Drinking beer and lemon-squashes, taking baths and cooling down.<br> <br></p>

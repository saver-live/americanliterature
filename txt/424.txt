<h2>Book I - Chapter 1</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> At the beginning of the long twilight of a summer evening, Sam McPherson,a tall big-boned boy of thirteen, with brown hair, black eyes, and anamusing little habit of tilting his chin in the air as he walked, cameupon the station platform of the little corn-shipping town of Caxton inIowa. It was a board platform, and the boy walked cautiously, lifting hisbare feet and putting them down with extreme deliberateness on the hot,dry, cracked planks. Under one arm he carried a bundle of newspapers. Along black cigar was in his hand.</p><p> In front of the station he stopped; and Jerry Donlin, the baggage-man,seeing the cigar in his hand, laughed, and slowly drew the side of hisface up into a laboured wink.</p><p> "What is the game to-night, Sam?" he asked.</p><p> Sam stepped to the baggage-room door, handed him the cigar, and begangiving directions, pointing into the baggage-room, intent and businesslike in the face of the Irishman's laughter. Then, turning, he walkedacross the station platform to the main street of the town, his eyes benton the ends of his fingers on which he was making computations with histhumb. Jerry looked after him, grinning so that his red gums made a splashof colour on his bearded face. A gleam of paternal pride lit his eyes andhe shook his head and muttered admiringly. Then, lighting the cigar, hewent down the platform to where a wrapped bundle of newspapers lay againstthe building, under the window of the telegraph office, and taking it inhis arm disappeared, still grinning, into the baggage-room.</p><p> Sam McPherson walked down Main Street, past the shoe store, the bakery,and the candy store kept by Penny Hughes, toward a group lounging at thefront of Geiger's drug store. Before the door of the shoe store he pauseda moment, and taking a small note-book from his pocket ran his finger downthe pages, then shaking his head continued on his way, again absorbed indoing sums on his fingers.</p><p> Suddenly, from among the men by the drug store, a roaring song broke theevening quiet of the street, and a voice, huge and guttural, brought asmile to the boy's lips:</p><p> "He washed the windows and he swept the floor, And he polished up the handle of the big front door. He polished that handle so carefullee, That now he's the ruler of the queen's navee."</p><p> The singer, a short man with grotesquely wide shoulders, wore a longflowing moustache, and a black coat, covered with dust, that reached tohis knees. He held a smoking briar pipe in his hand, and with it beat timefor a row of men sitting on a long stone under the store window andpounding on the sidewalk with their heels to make a chorus for the song.Sam's smile broadened into a grin as he looked at the singer, FreedomSmith, a buyer of butter and eggs, and past him at John Telfer, theorator, the dandy, the only man in town, except Mike McCarthy, who kepthis trousers creased. Among all the men of Caxton, Sam most admired JohnTelfer and in his admiration had struck upon the town's high light. Telferloved good clothes and wore them with an air, and never allowed Caxton tosee him shabbily or indifferently dressed, laughingly declaring that itwas his mission in life to give tone to the town.</p><p> John Telfer had a small income left him by his father, once a banker inthe town, and in his youth he had gone to New York to study art, and laterto Paris; but lacking ability or industry to get on had come back toCaxton where he had married Eleanor Millis, a prosperous milliner. Theywere the most successful married pair in Caxton, and after years of lifetogether they were still in love; were never indifferent to each other,and never quarrelled; Telfer treated his wife with as much considerationand respect as though she were a sweetheart, or a guest in his house, andshe, unlike most of the wives in Caxton, never ventured to question hisgoings and comings, but left him free to live his own life in his own waywhile she attended to the millinery business.</p><p> At the age of forty-five John Telfer was a tall, slender, fine lookingman, with black hair and a little black pointed beard, and with somethinglazy and care-free in his every movement and impulse. Dressed in whiteflannels, with white shoes, a jaunty cap upon his head, eyeglasses hangingfrom a gold chain, and a cane lightly swinging from his hand, he made afigure that might have passed unnoticed on the promenade before somefashionable summer hotel, but that seemed a breach of the laws of naturewhen seen on the streets of a corn-shipping town in Iowa. And Telfer wasaware of the extraordinary figure he cut; it was a part of his programmeof life. Now as Sam approached he laid a hand on Freedom Smith's shoulderto check the song, and, with his eyes twinkling with good-humour, beganthrusting with his cane at the boy's feet.</p><p> "He will never be ruler of the queen's navee," he declared, laughing andfollowing the dancing boy about in a wide circle. "He is a little molethat works underground intent upon worms. The trick he has of tilting uphis nose is only his way of smelling out stray pennies. I have it fromBanker Walker that he brings a basket of them into the bank every day. Oneof these days he will buy the town and put it into his vest pocket."</p><p> Circling about on the stone sidewalk and dancing to escape the flyingcane, Sam dodged under the arm of Valmore, a huge old blacksmith withshaggy clumps of hair on the back of his hands, and sought refuge betweenhim and Freedom Smith. The blacksmith's hand stole out and lay upon theboy's shoulder. Telfer, his legs spread apart and the cane hooked upon hisarm, began rolling a cigarette; Geiger, a yellow skinned man with fatcheeks and with hands clasped over his round paunch, smoked a black cigar,and as he sent each puff into the air, grunted forth his satisfaction withlife. He was wishing that Telfer, Freedom Smith, and Valmore, instead ofmoving on to their nightly nest at the back of Wildman's grocery, wouldcome into his place for the evening. He thought he would like to have thethree of them there night after night discussing the doings of the world.</p><p> Quiet once more settled down upon the sleepy street. Over Sam's shoulder,Valmore and Freedom Smith talked of the coming corn crop and the growthand prosperity of the country.</p><p> "Times are getting better about here, but the wild things are almostgone," said Freedom, who in the winter bought hides and pelts.</p><p> The men sitting on the stone beneath the window watched with idle interestTelfer's labours with paper and tobacco. "Young Henry Kerns has gotmarried," observed one of them, striving to make talk. "He has married agirl from over Parkertown way. She gives lessons in painting--chinapainting--kind of an artist, you know."</p><p> An ejaculation of disgust broke from Telfer: his fingers trembled and thetobacco that was to have been the foundation of his evening smoke rainedon the sidewalk.</p><p> "An artist!" he exclaimed, his voice tense with excitement. "Who saidartist? Who called her that?" He glared fiercely about. "Let us have anend to this blatant misuse of fine old words. To say of one that he is anartist is to touch the peak of praise."</p><p> Throwing his cigarette paper after the scattered tobacco he thrust onehand into his trouser pocket. With the other he held the cane, emphasisinghis points by ringing taps upon the pavement. Geiger, taking the cigarbetween his fingers, listened with open mouth to the outburst thatfollowed. Valmore and Freedom Smith dropped their conversation and withbroad smiles upon their faces gave attention, and Sam McPherson, his eyesround with wonder and admiration, felt again the thrill that always ranthrough him under the drum beats of Telfer's eloquence.</p><p> "An artist is one who hungers and thirsts after perfection, not one whodabs flowers upon plates to choke the gullets of diners," declared Telfer,setting himself for one of the long speeches with which he loved toastonish the men of Caxton, and glaring down at those seated upon thestone. "It is the artist who, among all men, has the divine audacity. Doeshe not hurl himself into a battle in which is engaged against him all ofthe accumulative genius of the world?"</p><p> Pausing, he looked about for an opponent upon whom he might pour the floodof his eloquence, but on all sides smiles greeted him. Undaunted, herushed again to the charge.</p><p> "A business man--what is he?" he demanded. "He succeeds by outwitting thelittle minds with which he comes in contact. A scientist is of moreaccount--he pits his brains against the dull unresponsiveness of inanimatematter and a hundredweight of black iron he makes do the work of a hundredhousewives. But an artist tests his brains against the greatest brains ofall times; he stands upon the peak of life and hurls himself against theworld. A girl from Parkertown who paints flowers upon dishes to be calledan artist--ugh! Let me spew forth the thought! Let me cleanse my mouth! Aman should have a prayer upon his lips who utters the word artist!"</p><p> "Well, we can't all be artists and the woman can paint flowers upon dishesfor all I care," spoke up Valmore, laughing good naturedly. "We can't allpaint pictures and write books."</p><p> "We do not want to be artists--we do not dare to be," shouted Telfer,whirling and shaking his cane at Valmore. "You have a misunderstanding ofthe word."</p><p> He straightened his shoulders and threw out his chest and the boy standingbeside the blacksmith threw up his chin, unconsciously imitating theswagger of the man.</p><p> "I do not paint pictures; I do not write books; yet am I an artist,"declared Telfer, proudly. "I am an artist practising the most difficult ofall arts--the art of living. Here in this western village I stand andfling my challenge to the world. 'On the lip of not the greatest of you,'I cry, 'has life been more sweet.'"</p><p> He turned from Valmore to the men upon the stone.</p><p> "Make a study of my life," he commanded. "It will be a revelation to you.With a smile I greet the morning; I swagger in the noontime; and in theevening, like Socrates of old, I gather a little group of you benightedvillagers about me and toss wisdom into your teeth, striving to teach youjudgment in the use of great words."</p><p> "You talk an almighty lot about yourself, John," grumbled Freedom Smith,taking his pipe from his mouth.</p><p> "The subject is complex, it is varied, it is full of charm," Telferanswered, laughing.</p><p> Taking a fresh supply of tobacco and paper from his pocket, he rolled andlighted a cigarette. His fingers no longer trembled. Flourishing his canehe threw back his head and blew smoke into the air. He thought that inspite of the roar of laughter that had greeted Freedom Smith's comment, hehad vindicated the honour of art and the thought made him happy.</p><p> To the newsboy, who had been leaning against the storefront lost inadmiration, it seemed that he had caught in Telfer's talk an echo of thekind of talk that must go on among men in the big outside world. Had notthis Telfer travelled far? Had he not lived in New York and Paris? Withoutunderstanding the sense of what had been said, Sam felt that it must besomething big and conclusive. When from the distance there came the shriekof a locomotive, he stood unmoved, trying to comprehend the meaning ofTelfer's outburst over the lounger's simple statement.</p><p> "There's the seven forty-five," cried Telfer, sharply. "Is the war betweenyou and Fatty at an end? Are we going to lose our evening's diversion? HasFatty bluffed you out or are you growing rich and lazy like Papa Geigerhere?"</p><p> Springing from his place beside the blacksmith and grasping the bundle ofnewspapers, Sam ran down the street, Telfer, Valmore, Freedom Smith andthe loungers following more slowly.</p><p> When the evening train from Des Moines stopped at Caxton, a blue-coatedtrain news merchant leaped hurriedly to the platform and began lookinganxiously about.</p><p> "Hurry, Fatty," rang out Freedom Smith's huge voice, "Sam's already halfthrough one car."</p><p> The young man called "Fatty" ran up and down the station platform. "Whereis that bundle of Omaha papers, you Irish loafer?" he shouted, shaking hisfist at Jerry Donlin who stood upon a truck at the front of the train, upending trunks into the baggage car.</p><p> Jerry paused with a trunk dangling in mid-air. "In the baggage-room, ofcourse. Hurry, man. Do you want the kid to work the whole train?"</p><p> An air of something impending hung over the idlers upon the platform, thetrain crew, and even the travelling men who began climbing off the train.The engineer thrust his head out of the cab; the conductor, a dignifiedlooking man with a grey moustache, threw back his head and shook withmirth; a young man with a suit-case in his hand and a long pipe in hismouth ran to the door of the baggage-room, calling, "Hurry! Hurry, Fatty!The kid is working the entire train. You won't be able to sell a paper."</p><p> The fat young man ran from the baggage-room to the platform and shoutedagain to Jerry Donlin, who was now slowly pushing the empty truck alongthe platform. From the train came a clear voice calling, "Latest Omahapapers! Have your change ready! Fatty, the train newsboy, has fallen downa well! Have your change ready, gentlemen!"</p><p> Jerry Donlin, followed by Fatty, again disappeared from sight. Theconductor, waving his hand, jumped upon the steps of the train. Theengineer pulled in his head and the train began to move.</p><p> The fat young man emerged from the baggage-room, swearing revenge upon thehead of Jerry Donlin. "There was no need to put it under a mail sack!" heshouted, shaking his fist. "I'll be even with you for this."</p><p> Followed by the shouts of the travelling men and the laughter of theidlers upon the platform he climbed upon the moving train and beganrunning from car to car. Off the last car dropped Sam McPherson, a smileupon his lips, the bundle of newspapers gone, his pocket jingling withcoins. The evening's entertainment for the town of Caxton was at an end.</p><p> John Telfer, standing by the side of Valmore, waved his cane in the airand began talking.</p><p> "Beat him again, by Gad!" he exclaimed. "Bully for Sam! Who says thespirit of the old buccaneers is dead? That boy didn't understand what Isaid about art, but he is an artist just the same!"</p><h2>Book I - Chapter 2</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> Windy McPherson, the father of the Caxton newsboy, Sam McPherson, had beenwar touched. The civilian clothes that he wore caused an itching of theskin. He could not forget that he had once been a sergeant in a regimentof infantry and had commanded a company through a battle fought in ditchesalong a Virginia country road. He chafed under the fact of his presentobscure position in life. Had he been able to replace his regimentals withthe robes of a judge, the felt hat of a statesman, or even with the nightstick of a village marshal life might have retained something of itssweetness, but to have ended by becoming an obscure housepainter in avillage that lived by raising corn and by feeding that corn to red steers--ugh!--the thought made him shudder. He looked with envy at the blue coatand the brass buttons of the railroad agent; he tried vainly to get intothe Caxton Cornet Band; he got drunk to forget his humiliation and in theend he fell to loud boasting and to the nursing of a belief within himselfthat in truth not Lincoln nor Grant but he himself had thrown the winningdie in the great struggle. In his cups he said as much and the Caxton corngrower, punching his neighbour in the ribs, shook with delight over thestatement.</p><p> When Sam was a twelve year old, barefooted boy upon the streets a kind ofbackwash of the wave of glory that had swept over Windy McPherson in thedays of '61 lapped upon the shores of the Iowa village. That strangemanifestation called the A. P. A. movement brought the old soldier to aposition of prominence in the community. He founded a local branch of theorganisation; he marched at the head of a procession through the streets;he stood on a corner and pointing a trembling forefinger to where the flagon the schoolhouse waved beside the cross of Rome, shouted hoarsely, "See,the cross rears itself above the flag! We shall end by being murdered inour beds!"</p><p> But although some of the hard-headed, money-making men of Caxton joinedthe movement started by the boasting old soldier and although for themoment they vied with him in stealthy creepings through the streets tosecret meetings and in mysterious mutterings behind hands the movementsubsided as suddenly as it had begun and only left its leader moredesolate.</p><p> In the little house at the end of the street by the shores of SquirrelCreek, Sam and his sister Kate regarded their father's warlike pretensionswith scorn. "The butter is low, father's army leg will ache to-night,"they whispered to each other across the kitchen table.</p><p> Following her mother's example, Kate, a tall slender girl of sixteen andalready a bread winner with a clerkship in Winney's drygoods store,remained silent under Windy's boasting, but Sam, striving to emulate them,did not always succeed. There was now and then a rebellious muttering thatshould have warned Windy. It had once burst into an open quarrel in whichthe victor of a hundred battles withdrew defeated from the field. Windy,half-drunk, had taken an old account book from a shelf in the kitchen, arelic of his days as a prosperous merchant when he had first come toCaxton, and had begun reading to the little family a list of names of menwho, he claimed, had been the cause of his ruin.</p><p> "There is Tom Newman, now," he exclaimed excitedly. "Owns a hundred acresof good corn-growing land and won't pay for the harness on the backs ofhis horses or for the ploughs in his barn. The receipt he has from me isforged. I could put him in prison if I chose. To beat an old soldier!--tobeat one of the boys of '61!--it is shameful!"</p><p> "I have heard of what you owed and what men owed you; you had none theworst of it," Sam protested coldly, while Kate held her breath and JaneMcPherson, at work over the ironing board in the corner, half turned andlooked silently at the man and the boy, the slightly increased pallor ofher long face the only sign that she had heard.</p><p> Windy had not pressed the quarrel. Standing for a moment in the middle ofthe kitchen, holding the book in his hand, he looked from the pale silentmother by the ironing board to the son now standing and staring at him,and, throwing the book upon the table with a bang, fled the house. "Youdon't understand," he had cried, "you don't understand the heart of asoldier."</p><p> In a way the man was right. The two children did not understand theblustering, pretending, inefficient old man. Having moved shoulder toshoulder with grim, silent men to the consummation of great deeds Windycould not get the flavour of those days out of his outlook upon life.Walking half drunk in the darkness along the sidewalks of Caxton on theevening of the quarrel the man became inspired. He threw back hisshoulders and walked with martial tread; he drew an imaginary sword fromits scabbard and waved it aloft; stopping, he aimed carefully at a body ofimaginary men who advanced yelling toward him across a wheatfield; he feltthat life in making him a housepainter in a farming village in Iowa and ingiving him an unappreciative son had been cruelly unfair; he wept at theinjustice of it.</p><p> The American Civil War was a thing so passionate, so inflaming, so vast,so absorbing, it so touched to the quick the men and women of thosepregnant days that but a faint echo of it has been able to penetrate downto our days and to our minds; no real sense of it has as yet crept intothe pages of a printed book; it yet wants its Thomas Carlyle; and in theend we are put to the need of listening to old fellows boasting on ourvillage streets to get upon our cheeks the living breath of it. For fouryears the men of American cities, villages and farms walked across thesmoking embers of a burning land, advancing and receding as the flame ofthat universal, passionate, death-spitting thing swept down upon them orreceded toward the smoking sky-line. Is it so strange that they could notcome home and begin again peacefully painting houses or mending brokenshoes? A something in them cried out. It sent them to bluster and boastupon the street corners. When people passing continued to think only oftheir brick laying and of their shovelling of corn into cars, when thesons of these war gods walking home at evening and hearing the vainboastings of the fathers began to doubt even the facts of the greatstruggle, a something snapped in their brains and they fell to chatteringand shouting their vain boastings to all as they looked hungrily about forbelieving eyes.</p><p> When our own Thomas Carlyle comes to write of our Civil War he will makemuch of our Windy McPhersons. He will see something big and pathetic intheir hungry search for auditors and in their endless war talk. He will gofilled with eager curiosity into little G. A. R. halls in the villages andthink of the men who coming there night after night, year after year, toldand re-told endlessly, monotonously, their story of battle.</p><p> Let us hope that in his fervour for the old fellows he will not fail totreat tenderly the families of those veteran talkers; the families thatwith their breakfasts and their dinners, by the fire at evening, throughfast day and feast day, at weddings and at funerals got again and againendlessly, everlastingly this flow of war words. Let him reflect thatpeaceful men in corn-growing counties do not by choice sleep among thedogs of war nor wash their linen in the blood of their country's foe. Lethim, in his sympathy with the talkers, remember with kindness the heroismof the listeners.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> On a summer day Sam McPherson sat on a box before Wildman's grocery lostin thought. In his hand he held the little yellow account book and in thishe buried himself, striving to wipe from his consciousness a scene beingenacted before his eyes upon the street.</p><p> The realisation of the fact that his father was a confirmed liar andbraggart had for years cast a shadow over his days and the shadow had beenmade blacker by the fact that in a land where the least fortunate canlaugh in the face of want he had more than once stood face to face withpoverty. He believed that the logical answer to the situation was money inthe bank and with all the ardour of his boy's heart he strove to realisethat answer. He wanted to be a money-maker and the totals at the foot ofthe pages in the soiled yellow bankbook were the milestones that markedthe progress he had already made. They told him that the daily struggleswith Fatty, the long tramps through Caxton's streets on bleak winterevenings, and the never-ending Saturday nights when crowds filled thestores, the sidewalks, and the drinking places, and he worked among themtirelessly and persistently were not without fruit.</p><p> Suddenly, above the murmur of men's voices on the street, his father'svoice rose loud and insistent. A block further down the street, leaningagainst the door of Hunter's jewelry store, Windy talked at the top of hislungs, pumping his arms up and down with the air of a man making a stumpspeech.</p><p> "He is making a fool of himself," thought Sam, and returned to hisbankbook, striving in the contemplation of the totals at the foot of thepages to shake off the dull anger that had begun to burn in his brain.Glancing up again, he saw that Joe Wildman, son of the grocer and a boy ofhis own age, had joined the group of men laughing and jeering at Windy.The shadow on Sam's face grew heavier.</p><p> Sam had been at Joe Wildman's house; he knew the air of plenty and ofcomfort that hung over it; the table piled high with meat and potatoes;the group of children laughing and eating to the edge of gluttony; thequiet, gentle father who amid the clamour and the noise did not raise hisvoice, and the well-dressed, bustling, rosy-cheeked mother. As a contrastto this scene he began to call up in his mind a picture of life in his ownhome, getting a kind of perverted pleasure out of his dissatisfaction withit. He saw the boasting, incompetent father telling his endless tales ofthe Civil War and complaining of his wounds; the tall, stoop-shouldered,silent mother with the deep lines in her long face, everlastingly at workover her washtub among the soiled clothes; the silent, hurriedly-eatenmeals snatched from the kitchen table; and the long winter days when iceformed upon his mother's skirts and Windy idled about town while thelittle family subsisted upon bowls of cornmeal mush everlastinglyrepeated.</p><p> Now, even from where he sat, he could see that his father was half gone indrink, and knew that he was boasting of his part in the Civil War. "He iseither doing that or telling of his aristocratic family or lying about hisbirthplace," he thought resentfully, and unable any longer to endure thesight of what seemed to him his own degradation, he got up and went intothe grocery where a group of Caxton citizens stood talking to Wildman of ameeting to be held that morning at the town hall.</p><p> Caxton was to have a Fourth of July celebration. The idea, born in theheads of the few, had been taken up by the many. Rumours of it had runthrough the streets late in May. It had been talked of in Geiger's drugstore, at the back of Wildman's grocery, and in the street before the NewLeland House. John Telfer, the town's one man of leisure, had for weeksbeen going from place to place discussing the details with prominent men.Now a mass meeting was to be held in the hall over Geiger's drug store andto a man the citizens of Caxton had turned out for the meeting. Thehousepainter had come down off his ladder, the clerks were locking thedoors of the stores, men went along the streets in groups bound for thehall. As they went they shouted to each other. "The old town has woke up,"they called.</p><p> On a corner by Hunter's jewelry store Windy McPherson leaned against abuilding and harangued the passing crowd.</p><p> "Let the old flag wave," he shouted excitedly, "let the men of Caxton showthe true blue and rally to the old standards."</p><p> "That's right, Windy, expostulate with them," shouted a wit, and a roar oflaughter drowned Windy's reply.</p><p> Sam McPherson also went to the meeting in the hall. He came out of thegrocery store with Wildman and went along the street looking at thesidewalk and trying not to see the drunken man talking in front of thejewelry store. At the hall other boys stood in the stairway or ran up anddown the sidewalk talking excitedly, but Sam was a figure in the town'slife and his right to push in among the men was not questioned. Hesquirmed through the mass of legs and secured a seat in a window ledgewhere he could watch the men come in and find seats.</p><p> As Caxton's one newsboy Sam had got from his newspaper selling both aliving and a kind of standing in the town's life. To be a newsboy or abootblack in a small novel-reading American town is to make a figure inthe world. Do not all of the poor newsboys in the books become great menand is not this boy who goes among us so industriously day after daylikely to become such a figure? Is it not a duty we of the town owe tofuture greatness that we push him forward? So reasoned the men of Caxtonand paid a kind of court to the boy who sat on the window ledge of thehall while the other boys of the town waited on the sidewalk below.</p><p> John Telfer was chairman of the mass meeting. He was always chairman ofpublic meetings in Caxton. The industrious silent men of position in thetown envied his easy, bantering style of public address, while pretendingto treat it with scorn. "He talks too much," they said, making a virtue oftheir own inability with apt and clever words.</p><p> Telfer did not wait to be appointed chairman of the meeting, but wentforward, climbed the little raised platform at the end of the hall, andusurped the chairmanship. He walked up and down on the platform banteringwith the crowd, answering gibes, calling to well-known men, getting andgiving keen satisfaction with his talent. When the hall was filled withmen he called the meeting to order, appointed committees and launched intoa harangue. He told of plans made to advertise the big day in other townsand to get low railroad rates arranged for excursion parties. Theprogramme, he said, included a musical carnival with brass bands fromother towns, a sham battle by the military company at the fairgrounds,horse races, speeches from the steps of the town hall, and fireworks inthe evening. "We'll show them a live town here," he declared, walking upand down the platform and swinging his cane, while the crowd applauded andshouted its approval.</p><p> When a call came for voluntary subscriptions to pay for the fun, theaudience quieted down. One or two men got up and started to go out,grumbling that it was a waste of money. The fate of the celebration was onthe knees of the gods.</p><p> Telfer arose to the occasion. He called out the names of the departing,and made jests at their expense so that they dropped back into theirchairs unable to face the roaring laughter of the crowd, and shouted to aman at the back of the hall to close and bolt the door. Men began gettingup in various parts of the hall and calling out sums, Telfer repeating thename and the amount in a loud voice to young Tom Jedrow, clerk in thebank, who wrote them down in a book. When the amount subscribed did notmeet with his approval, he protested and the crowd backing him up forcedthe increase he demanded. When a man did not rise, he shouted at him andthe man answered back an amount.</p><p> Suddenly in the hall a diversion arose. Windy McPherson emerged from thecrowd at the back of the hall and walked down the centre aisle to theplatform. He walked unsteadily straightening his shoulders and thrustingout his chin. When he got to the front of the hall he took a roll of billsfrom his pocket and threw it on the platform at the chairman's feet. "Fromone of the boys of '61," he announced in a loud voice.</p><p> The crowd shouted and clapped its hands with delight as Telfer picked upthe bills and ran his finger over them. "Seventeen dollars from our hero,the mighty McPherson," he shouted while the bank clerk wrote the name andthe amount in the book and the crowd continued to make merry over thetitle given the drunken soldier by the chairman.</p><p> The boy on the window ledge slipped to the floor and stood with burningcheeks behind the mass of men. He knew that at home his mother was doing afamily washing for Lesley, the shoe merchant, who had given five dollarsto the Fourth-of-July fund, and the resentment he had felt on seeing hisfather talking to the crowd before the jewelry store blazed up anew.</p><p> After the taking of subscriptions, men in various parts of the hall beganmaking suggestions for added features for the great day. To some of thespeakers the crowd listened respectfully, at others they hooted. An oldman with a grey beard told a long rambling story of a Fourth-of-Julycelebration of his boyhood. When voices interrupted he protested and shookhis fist in the air, pale with indignation.</p><p> "Oh, sit down, old daddy," shouted Freedom Smith and a murmur of applausegreeted this sensible suggestion.</p><p> Another man got up and began to talk. He had an idea. "We will have," hesaid, "a bugler mounted on a white horse who will ride through the town atdawn blowing the reveille. At midnight he will stand on the steps of thetown hall and blow taps to end the day."</p><p> The crowd applauded. The idea had caught their fancy and had instantlytaken a place in their minds as one of the real events of the day.</p><p> Again Windy McPherson emerged from the crowd at the back of the hall.Raising his hand for silence he told the crowd that he was a bugler, thathe had been a regimental bugler for two years during the Civil War. Hesaid that he would gladly volunteer for the place.</p><p> The crowd shouted and John Telfer waved his hand. "The white horse foryou, McPherson," he said.</p><p> Sam McPherson wriggled along the wall and out at the now unbolted door. Hewas filled with astonishment at his father's folly, and was still moreastonished at the folly of these other men in accepting his statement andhanding over the important place for the big day. He knew that his fathermust have had some part in the war as he was a member of the G. A. R., buthe had no faith at all in the stories he had heard him relate of hisexperiences in the war. Sometimes he caught himself wondering if thereever had been such a war and thought that it must be a lie like everythingelse in the life of Windy McPherson. For years he had wondered why somesensible solid person like Valmore or Wildman did not rise, and in amatter-of-fact way tell the world that no such thing as the Civil War hadever been fought, that it was merely a figment in the minds of pompous oldmen demanding unearned glory of their fellows. Now hurrying along thestreet with burning cheeks, he decided that after all there must have beensuch a war. He had had the same feeling about birthplaces and there couldbe no doubt that people were born. He had heard his father claim as hisbirthplace Kentucky, Texas, North Carolina, Louisiana and Scotland. Thething had left a kind of defect in his mind. To the end of his life whenhe heard a man tell the place of his birth he looked up suspiciously, anda shadow of doubt crossed his mind.</p><p> From the mass meeting Sam went home to his mother and presented the casebluntly. "The thing will have to be stopped," he declared, standing withblazing eyes before her washtub. "It is too public. He can't blow a bugle;I know he can't. The whole town will have another laugh at our expense."</p><p> Jane McPherson listened in silence to the boy's outburst, then, turning,went back to rubbing clothes, avoiding his eyes.</p><p> With his hands thrust into his trousers pocket Sam stared sullenly at theground. A sense of justice told him not to press the matter, but as hewalked away from the washtub and out at the kitchen door, he hoped therewould be plain talk of the matter at supper time. "The old fool!" heprotested, addressing the empty street. "He is going to make a show ofhimself again."</p><p> When Windy McPherson came home that evening, something in the eyes of thesilent wife, and the sullen face of the boy, startled him. He passed overlightly his wife's silence but looked closely at his son. He felt that hefaced a crisis. In the emergency he was magnificent. With a flourish, hetold of the mass meeting, and declared that the citizens of Caxton hadarisen as one man to demand that he take the responsible place as officialbugler. Then, turning, he glared across the table at his son.</p><p> Sam, openly defiant, announced that he did not believe his father capableof blowing a bugle.</p><p> Windy roared with amazement. He rose from the table declaring in a loudvoice that the boy had wronged him; he swore that he had been for twoyears bugler on the staff of a colonel, and launched into a long story ofa surprise by the enemy while his regiment lay asleep in their tents, andof his standing in the face of a storm of bullets and blowing his comradesto action. Putting one hand on his forehead he rocked back and forth asthough about to fall, declaring that he was striving to keep back thetears wrenched from him by the injustice of his son's insinuation and,shouting so that his voice carried far down the street, he declared withan oath that the town of Caxton should ring and echo with his bugling asthe sleeping camp had echoed with it that night in the Virginia wood. Thendropping again into his chair, and resting his head upon his hand, heassumed a look of patient resignation.</p><p> Windy McPherson was victorious. In the little house a great stir andbustle of preparation arose. Putting on his white overalls and forgettingfor the time his honourable wounds the father went day after day to hiswork as a housepainter. He dreamed of a new blue uniform for the great dayand in the end achieved the realisation of his dreams, not however withoutmaterial assistance from what was known in the house as "Mother's WashMoney." And the boy, convinced by the story of the midnight attack in thewoods of Virginia, began against his judgment to build once more an olddream of his father's reformation. Boylike, the scepticism was thrown tothe winds and he entered with zeal into the plans for the great day. As hewent through the quiet residence streets delivering the late eveningpapers, he threw back his head and revelled in the thought of a tall blueclad figure on a great white horse passing like a knight before the gapingpeople. In a fervent moment he even drew money from his carefully built-upbank account and sent it to a firm in Chicago to pay for a shining newbugle that would complete the picture he had in his mind. And when theevening papers were distributed he hurried home to sit on the porch beforethe house discussing with his sister Kate the honours that had alightedupon their family.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> With the coming of dawn on the great day the three McPhersons hurried handin hand toward Main Street. In the street, on all sides of them, they sawpeople coming out of houses rubbing their eyes and buttoning their coatsas they went along the sidewalk. All of Caxton seemed abroad.</p><p> In Main Street the people were packed on the sidewalk, and massed on thecurb and in the doorways of the stores. Heads appeared at windows, flagswaved from roofs or hung from ropes stretched across the street, and agreat murmur of voices broke the silence of the dawn.</p><p> Sam's heart beat so that he was hard put to it to keep back the tears fromhis eyes. He thought with a gasp of the days of anxiety that had passedwhen the new bugle had not come from the Chicago company, and inretrospect he suffered again the horror of the days of waiting. It hadbeen all important. He could not blame his father for raving and shoutingabout the house, he himself had felt like raving, and had put anotherdollar of his savings into telegrams before the treasure was finally inhis hands. Now, the thought that it might not have come sickened him, anda little prayer of thankfulness rose from his lips. To be sure one mighthave been secured from a nearby town, but not a new shining one to go withhis father's new blue uniform.</p><p> A cheer broke from the crowd massed along the street. Into the street rodea tall figure seated upon a white horse. The horse was from Culvert'slivery and the boys there had woven ribbons into its mane and tail. WindyMcPherson, sitting very straight in the saddle and looking wonderfullystriking in the new blue uniform and the broad-brimmed campaign hat, hadthe air of a conqueror come to receive the homage of the town. He wore a gold band across his chest and against his hip rested theshining bugle. With stern eyes he looked down upon the people.</p><p> The lump in the throat of the boy hurt more and more. A great wave ofpride ran over him, submerging him. In a moment he forgot all the pasthumiliations the father had brought upon his family, and understood whyhis mother remained silent when he, in his blindness, had wanted toprotest against her seeming indifference. Glancing furtively up he saw atear lying upon her cheek and felt that he too would like to sob aloud hispride and happiness.</p><p> Slowly and with stately stride the horse walked up the street between therows of silent waiting people. In front of the town hall the tall militaryfigure, rising in the saddle, took one haughty look at the multitude, andthen, putting the bugle to his lips, blew.</p><p> Out of the bugle came only a thin piercing shriek followed by a squawk.Again Windy put the bugle to his lips and again the same dismal squawk washis only reward. On his face was a look of helpless boyish astonishment.</p><p> And in a moment the people knew. It was only another of Windy McPherson'spretensions. He couldn't blow a bugle at all.</p><p> A great shout of laughter rolled down the street. Men and women sat on thecurbstones and laughed until they were tired. Then, looking at the figureupon the motionless horse, they laughed again.</p><p> Windy looked about him with troubled eyes. It is doubtful if he had everhad a bugle to his lips until that moment, but he was filled with wonderand astonishment that the reveille did not roll forth. He had heard thething a thousand times and had it clearly in his mind; with all his hearthe wanted it to roll forth, and could picture the street ringing with itand the applause of the people; the thing, he felt, was in him, and it wasonly a fatal blunder in nature that it did not come out at the flaring endof the bugle. He was amazed at this dismal end of his great moment--he wasalways amazed and helpless before facts.</p><p> The crowd began gathering about the motionless, astonished figure,laughter continuing to send them off into something near convulsions.Grasping the bridle of the horse, John Telfer began leading it off up thestreet. Boys whooped and shouted at the rider, "Blow! Blow!"</p><p> The three McPhersons stood in a doorway leading into a shoe store. The boyand the mother, white and speechless with humiliation, dared not look ateach other. In the flood of shame sweeping over them they stared straightbefore them with hard, stony eyes.</p><p> The procession led by John Telfer at the bridle of the white horse marcheddown the street. Looking up, the eyes of the laughing, shouting man metthose of the boy and a look of pain shot across his face. Dropping thebridle he hurried away through the crowd. The procession moved on, andwatching their chance the mother and the two children crept home alongside streets, Kate weeping bitterly. Leaving them at the door Sam wentstraight on down a sandy road toward a small wood. "I've got my lesson.I've got my lesson," he muttered over and over as he went.</p><p> At the edge of the wood he stopped and leaning on a rail fence watcheduntil he saw his mother come out to the pump in the back yard. She hadbegun to draw water for the day's washing. For her also the holiday was atan end. A flood of tears ran down the boy's cheeks, and he shook his fistin the direction of the town. "You may laugh at that fool Windy, but youshall never laugh at Sam McPherson," he cried, his voice shaking withexcitement.</p><h2>Book I - Chapter 3</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> One evening, when he had grown so that he outtopped Windy, Sam McPhersonreturned from his paper route to find his mother arrayed in her black,church-going dress. An evangelist was at work in Caxton and she haddecided to hear him. Sam shuddered. In the house it was an understoodthing that when Jane McPherson went to church her son went with her. Therewas nothing said. Jane McPherson did all things without words, alwaysthere was nothing said. Now she stood waiting in her black dress when herson came in at the door and he hurriedly put on his best clothes and wentwith her to the brick church.</p><p> Valmore, John Telfer, and Freedom Smith, who had taken upon themselves akind of common guardianship of the boy and with whom he spent eveningafter evening at the back of Wildman's grocery, did not go to church. Theytalked of religion and seemed singularly curious and interested in whatother men thought on the subject but they did not allow themselves to becoaxed into a house of worship. To the boy, who had become a fourth memberof the evening gatherings at the back of the grocery store, they would nottalk of God, answering the direct questions he sometimes asked by changingthe subject. Once Telfer, the reader of poetry, answered the boy. "Sellpapers and fill your pockets with money but let your soul sleep," he saidsharply.</p><p> In the absence of the others Wildman talked more freely. He was aspiritualist and tried to make Sam see the beauties of that faith. On longsummer afternoons the grocer and the boy spent hours driving through thestreets in a rattling old delivery wagon, the man striving earnestly tomake clear to the boy the shadowy ideas of God that were in his mind.</p><p> Although Windy McPherson had been the leader of a Bible class in hisyouth, and had been a moving spirit at revival meetings during his earlydays in Caxton, he no longer went to church and his wife did not ask himto go. On Sunday mornings he lay abed. If there was work to be done aboutthe house or yard he complained of his wounds. He complained of his woundswhen the rent fell due, and when there was a shortage of food in thehouse. Later in his life and after the death of Jane McPherson the oldsoldier married the widow of a farmer by whom he had four children andwith whom he went to church twice on Sunday. Kate wrote Sam one of herinfrequent letters about it. "He has met his match," she said, and wastremendously pleased.</p><p> In church on Sunday mornings Sam went regularly to sleep, putting his headon his mother's arm and sleeping throughout the service. Jane McPhersonloved to have the boy there beside her. It was the one thing in life theydid together and she did not mind his sleeping the time away. Knowing howlate he had been upon the streets at the paper selling on Saturdayevenings, she looked at him with eyes filled with tenderness and sympathy.Once the minister, a man with brown beard and hard, tightly-closed mouth,spoke to her. "Can't you keep him awake?" he asked impatiently. "He needsthe sleep," she said and hurried past the minister and out of the church,looking ahead of her and frowning.</p><p> The evening of the evangelist meeting was a summer evening fallen on awinter month. All day the warm winds had come up from the southwest. Mudlay soft and deep in the streets and among the little pools of water onthe sidewalks were dry spots from which steam arose. Nature had forgottenherself. A day that should have sent old fellows to their nests behindstoves in stores sent them forth to loaf in the sun. The night fell warmand cloudy. A thunder storm threatened in the month of February.</p><p> Sam walked along the sidewalk with his mother bound for the brick church,wearing a new grey overcoat. The night did not demand the overcoat but Samwore it out of an excess of pride in its possession. The overcoat had anair. It had been made by Gunther the tailor after a design sketched on theback of a piece of wrapping paper by John Telfer and had been paid for outof the newsboy's savings. The little German tailor, after a talk withValmore and Telfer, had made it at a marvellously low price. Sam swaggeredas he walked.</p><p> He did not sleep in church that evening; indeed he found the quiet churchfilled with a medley of strange noises. Folding carefully the new coat andlaying it beside him on the seat he looked with interest at the people,feeling within him something of the nervous excitement with which the airwas charged. The evangelist, a short, athletic-looking man in a greybusiness suit, seemed to the boy out of place in the church. He had theassured business-like air of the travelling men who come to the New LelandHouse, and Sam thought he looked like a man who had goods to be sold. Hedid not stand quietly back of the pulpit giving out the text as did thebrown-bearded minister, nor did he sit with closed eyes and clasped handswaiting for the choir to finish singing. While the choir sang he ran upand down the platform waving his arms and shouting excitedly to the peopleon the church benches, "Sing! Sing! Sing! For the glory of God, sing!"</p><p> When the song was finished, he began talking, quietly at first, of life inthe town. As he talked he grew more and more excited. "The town is acesspool of vice!" he shouted. "It reeks with evil! The devil counts it asuburb of hell!"</p><p> His voice rose, and sweat ran off his face. A sort of frenzy seized him.He pulled off his coat and throwing it over a chair ran up and down theplatform and into the aisles among the people, shouting, threatening,pleading. People began to stir uneasily in their seats. Jane McPhersonstared stonily at the back of the woman in front of her. Sam was horriblyfrightened.</p><p> The newsboy of Caxton was not without a hunger for religion. Like all boyshe thought much and often of death. In the night he sometimes awakenedcold with fear, thinking that death must be just without the door of hisroom waiting for him. When in the winter he had a cold and coughed, hetrembled at the thought of tuberculosis. Once, when he was taken with afever, he fell asleep and dreamed that he had died and was walking on thetrunk of a fallen tree over a ravine filled with lost souls that shriekedwith terror. When he awoke he prayed. Had some one come into his room andheard his prayer he would have been ashamed.</p><p> On winter evenings as he walked through the dark streets with the papersunder his arm he thought of his soul. As he thought a tenderness came overhim; a lump came into his throat and he pitied himself; he felt that therewas something missing in his life, something he wanted very badly.</p><p> Under John Telfer's influence, the boy, who had quit school to devotehimself to money making, read Walt Whitman and had a season of admiringhis own body with its straight white legs, and the head that was poised sojauntily on the body. Sometimes he would awaken on summer nights and be sofilled with strange longing that he would creep out of bed and, pushingopen the window, sit upon the floor, his bare legs sticking out beyond hiswhite nightgown, and, thus sitting, yearn eagerly toward some fineimpulse, some call, some sense of bigness and of leadership that wasabsent from the necessities of the life he led. He looked at the stars andlistened to the night noises, so filled with longing that the tears sprangto his eyes.</p><p> Once, after the affair of the bugle, Jane McPherson had been ill--and thefirst touch of the finger of death reaching out to her--had sat with herson in the warm darkness in the little grass plot at the front of thehouse. It was a clear, warm, starlit evening without a moon, and as thetwo sat closely together a sense of the coming of death crept over themother.</p><p> At the evening meal Windy McPherson had talked voluminously, ranting andshouting about the house. He said that a housepainter who had a real senseof colour had no business trying to work in a hole like Caxton. He hadbeen in trouble with a housewife about a colour he had mixed for paintinga porch floor and at his own table he raved about the woman and what hedeclared her lack of even a primitive sense of colour. "I am sick of itall," he shouted, going out of the house and up the street with uncertainsteps. His wife had been unmoved by his outburst, but in the presence ofthe quiet boy whose chair touched her own she trembled with a strange newfear and began to talk of the life after death, making effort after effortto get at what she wanted to say, and only succeeding in findingexpression for her thoughts in little sentences broken by long painfulpauses. She told the boy she had no doubt at all that there was some kindof future life and that she believed she should see and live with himagain after they had finished with this world.</p><p> One day the minister who had been annoyed because he had slept in hischurch, stopped Sam on the street to talk to him of his soul. He said thatthe boy should be thinking of making himself one of the brothers in Christby joining the church. Sam listened silently to the talk of the man, whomhe instinctively disliked, but in his silence felt there was somethinginsincere. With all his heart he wanted to repeat a sentence he had heardfrom the lips of grey-haired, big-fisted Valmore--"How can they believeand not lead a life of simple, fervent devotion to their belief?" Hethought himself superior to the thin-lipped man who talked with him andhad he been able to express what was in his heart he might have said,"Look here, man! I am made of different stuff from all the people there atthe church. I am new clay to be moulded into a new man. Not even my motheris like me. I do not accept your ideas of life just because you say theyare good any more than I accept Windy McPherson just because he happens tobe my father."</p><p> During one winter Sam spent evening after evening reading the Bible in hisroom. It was after Kate's marriage--she had got into an affair with ayoung farmer that had kept her name upon the tongues of whisperers formonths but was now a housewife on a farm at the edge of a village somemiles from Caxton, and the mother was again at her endless task among thesoiled clothes in the kitchen and Windy McPherson off drinking andboasting about town. Sam read the book in secret. He had a lamp on alittle stand beside his bed and a novel, lent him by John Telfer, besideit. When his mother came up the stairway he slipped the Bible under thecover of the bed and became absorbed in the novel. He thought it somethingnot quite in keeping with his aims as a business man and a money getter tobe concerned about his soul. He wanted to conceal his concern but with allhis heart wanted to get hold of the message of the strange book, aboutwhich men wrangled hour after hour on winter evenings in the store.</p><p> He did not get it; and after a time he stopped reading the book. Left tohimself he might have sensed its meaning, but on all sides of him were thevoices of the men--the men at Wildman's who owned to no faith and yet werefilled with dogmatisms as they talked behind the stove in the grocery; thebrown-bearded, thin-lipped minister in the brick church; the shouting,pleading evangelists who came to visit the town in the winter; the gentleold grocer who talked vaguely of the spirit world,--all these voices wereat the mind of the boy pleading, insisting, demanding, not that Christ'ssimple message that men love one another to the end, that they worktogether for the common good, be accepted, but that their own complexinterpretation of his word be taken to the end that souls be saved.</p><p> In the end the boy of Caxton got to the place where he had a dread of theword soul. It seemed to him that the mention of the word in conversationwas something shameful and to think of the word or the shadowy somethingfor which the word stood an act of cowardice. In his mind the soul becamea thing to be hidden away, covered up, not thought of. One might beallowed to speak of the matter at the moment of death, but for the healthyman or boy to have the thought of his soul in his mind or word of it onhis lips--one might better become blatantly profane and go to the devilwith a swagger. With delight he imagined himself as dying and with hislast breath tossing a round oath into the air of his death chamber.</p><p> In the meantime Sam continued to have inexplicable longings and hopes. Hekept surprising himself by the changing aspect of his own viewpoint oflife. He found himself indulging in the most petty meannesses, andfollowing these with flashes of a kind of loftiness of mind. Looking at agirl passing in the street, he had unbelievably mean thoughts; and thenext day, passing the same girl, a line caught from the babbling of JohnTelfer came to his lips and he went his way muttering, "June's twice Junesince she breathed it with me."</p><p> And then into the complex nature of this boy came the sex motive. Alreadyhe dreamed of having women in his arms. He looked shyly at the ankles ofwomen crossing the street, and listened eagerly when the crowd about thestove in Wildman's fell to telling smutty stories. He sank to unbelievabledepths of triviality in sordidness, looking shyly into dictionaries forwords that appealed to the animal lust in his queerly perverted mind and,when he came across it, lost entirely the beauty of the old Bible tale ofRuth in the suggestion of intimacy between man and woman that it broughtto him. And yet Sam McPherson was no evil-minded boy. He had, as a matterof fact, a quality of intellectual honesty that appealed strongly to theclean-minded, simple-hearted old blacksmith Valmore; he had awakenedsomething like love in the hearts of the women school teachers in theCaxton schools, at least one of whom continued to interest herself in him,taking him with her on walks along country roads, and talking to himconstantly of the development of his mind; and he was the friend and booncompanion of Telfer, the dandy, the reader of poems, the keen lover oflife. The boy was struggling to find himself. One night when the sex callkept him awake he got up and dressed, and went and stood in the rain bythe creek in Miller's pasture. The wind swept the rain across the face ofthe water and a sentence flashed through his mind: "The little feet of therain run on the water." There was a quality of almost lyrical beauty inthe Iowa boy.</p><p> And this boy, who couldn't get hold of his impulse toward God, whose seximpulses made him at times mean, at times full of beauty, and who haddecided that the impulse toward bargaining and money getting was theimpulse in him most worth cherishing, now sat beside his mother in churchand watched with wide-open eyes the man who took off his coat, who sweatedprofusely, and who called the town in which he lived a cesspool of viceand its citizens wards of the devil.</p><p> The evangelist from talking of the town began talking instead of heavenand hell and his earnestness caught the attention of the listening boy whobegan seeing pictures.</p><p> Into his mind there came a picture of a burning pit of fire in which greatflames leaped about the heads of the people who writhed in the pit. "ArtSherman would be there," thought Sam, materialising the picture he saw;"nothing can save him; he keeps a saloon."</p><p> Filled with pity for the man he saw in the picture of the burning pit, hismind centered on the person of Art Sherman. He liked Art Sherman. Morethan once he had felt the touch of human kindness in the man. The roaring,blustering saloonkeeper had helped the boy sell and collect fornewspapers. "Pay the kid or get out of the place," the red-faced manroared at drunken men leaning on the bar.</p><p> And then, looking into the burning pit, Sam thought of Mike McCarthy, forwhom he had at that moment a kind of passion akin to a young girl's blinddevotion to her lover. With a shudder he realised that Mike also would gointo the pit, for he had heard Mike laughing at churches and declaringthere was no God.</p><p> The evangelist ran upon the platform and called to the people demandingthat they stand upon their feet. "Stand up for Jesus," he shouted; "standup and be counted among the host of the Lord God."</p><p> In the church people began getting to their feet. Jane McPherson stoodwith the others. Sam did not stand. He crept behind his mother's dress,hoping to pass through the storm unnoticed. The call to the faithful tostand was a thing to be complied with or resisted as the people mightwish; it was something entirely outside of himself. It did not occur tohim to count himself among either the lost or the saved.</p><p> Again the choir began singing and a businesslike movement began among thepeople. Men and women went up and down the aisles clasping the hands ofpeople in the pews, talking and praying aloud. "Welcome among us," theysaid to certain ones who stood upon their feet. "It gladdens our hearts tosee you among us. We are happy at seeing you in the fold among the saved.It is good to confess Jesus."</p><p> Suddenly a voice from the bench back of him struck terror to Sam's heart.Jim Williams, who worked in Sawyer's barber shop, was upon his knees andin a loud voice was praying for the soul of Sam McPherson. "Lord, helpthis erring boy who goes up and down in the company of sinners andpublicans," he shouted.</p><p> In a moment the terror of death and the fiery pit that had possessed himpassed, and Sam was filled instead with blind, dumb rage. He rememberedthat this same Jim Williams had treated lightly the honour of his sisterat the time of her disappearance, and he wanted to get upon his feet andpour out his wrath on the head of the man, who, he felt, had betrayed him."They would not have seen me," he thought; "this is a fine trick JimWilliams has played me. I shall be even with him for this."</p><p> He got to his feet and stood beside his mother. He had no qualms aboutpassing himself off as one of the lambs safely within the fold. His mindwas bent upon quieting Jim Williams' prayers and avoiding the attention ofthe people.</p><p> The minister began calling on the standing people to testify of theirsalvation. From various parts of the church the people spoke out, someloudly and boldly and with a ring of confidence in their voices, sometremblingly and hesitatingly. One woman wept loudly shouting between theparoxysms of sobbing that seized her, "The weight of my sins is heavy onmy soul." Girls and young men when called on by the minister respondedwith shamed, hesitating voices asking that a verse of some hymn be sung,or quoting a line of scripture.</p><p> At the back of the church the evangelist with one of the deacons and twoor three women had gathered about a small, black-haired woman, the wife ofa baker to whom Sam delivered papers. They were urging her to rise and getwithin the fold, and Sam turned and watched her curiously, his sympathygoing out to her. With all his heart he hoped that she would continuedoggedly shaking her head.</p><p> Suddenly the irrepressible Jim Williams broke forth again. A quiver ranover Sam's body and the blood rose to his cheeks. "Here is another sinnersaved," shouted Jim, pointing to the standing boy. "Count this boy, SamMcPherson, in the fold among the lambs."</p><p> On the platform the brown-bearded minister stood upon a chair and lookedover the heads of the people. An ingratiating smile played about his lips."Let us hear from the young man, Sam McPherson," he said, raising his handfor silence, and, then, encouragingly, "Sam, what have you to say for theLord?"</p><p> Become the centre for the attention of the people in the church Sam wasterror-stricken. The rage against Jim Williams was forgotten in the spasmof fear that seized him. He looked over his shoulder to the door at theback of the church and thought longingly of the quiet street outside. Hehesitated, stammered, grew more red and uncertain, and finally burst out:"The Lord," he said, and then looked about hopelessly, "the Lord maketh meto lie out in green pastures."</p><p> In the seats behind him a titter arose. A young woman sitting among thesingers in the choir put her handkerchief to her face and throwing backher head rocked back and forth. A man near the door guffawed loudly andwent hurriedly out. All over the church people began laughing.</p><p> Sam turned his eyes upon his mother. She was staring straight ahead ofher, and her face was red. "I'm going out of this place and I'm nevercoming back again," he whispered, and, stepping into the aisle, walkedboldly toward the door. He had made up his mind that if the evangelisttried to stop him he would fight. At his back he felt the rows of peoplelooking at him and smiling. The laughter continued.</p><p> In the street he hurried along consumed with indignation. "I'll never gointo any church again," he swore, shaking his fist in the air. The publicavowals he had heard in the church seemed to him cheap and unworthy. Hewondered why his mother stayed in there. With a sweep of his arm hedismissed all the people in the church. "It is a place to make publicasses of the people," he thought.</p><p> Sam McPherson wandered through Main Street, dreading to meet Valmore andJohn Telfer. Finding the chairs back of the stove in Wildman's grocerydeserted, he hurried past the grocer and hid in a corner. Tears of wrathstood in his eyes. He had been made a fool of. He imagined the scene thatwould go on when he came upon the street with the papers the next morning.Freedom Smith would be there sitting in the old worn buggy and roaring sothat all the street would listen and laugh. "Going to lie out in any greenpastures to-night, Sam?" he would shout. "Ain't you afraid you'll takecold?" By Geiger's drug store would stand Valmore and Telfer, eager tojoin in the fun at his expense. Telfer would pound on the side of thebuilding with his cane and roar with laughter. Valmore would make atrumpet of his hands and shout after the fleeing boy. "Do you sleep outalone in them green pastures?" Freedom Smith would roar again.</p><p> Sam got up and went out of the grocery. As he hurried along, blind withwrath, he felt he would like a stand-up fight with some one. And, then,hurrying and avoiding the people, he merged with the crowd on the streetand became a witness to the strange thing that happened that night inCaxton.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> In Main Street hushed people stood about in groups talking. The air washeavy with excitement. Solitary figures went from group to groupwhispering hoarsely. Mike McCarthy, the man who had denied God and who hadwon a place for himself in the affection of the newsboy, had assaulted aman with a pocket knife and had left him bleeding and wounded beside acountry road. Something big and sensational had happened in the life ofthe town.</p><p> Mike McCarthy and Sam were friends. For years the man had idled upon thestreets of the town, loitering about, boasting and talking. He had sat forhours in a chair under a tree before the New Leland House, reading books,doing tricks with cards, engaging in long discussions with John Telfer orany who would stand up to him.</p><p> Mike McCarthy got into trouble in a fight over a woman. A young farmerliving at the edge of Caxton had come home from the fields to find hiswife in the bold Irishman's arms and the two men had gone out of the housetogether to fight in the road. The woman, weeping in the house, followedto ask forgiveness of her husband. Running in the gathering darkness alongthe road she had found him cut and bleeding terribly, lying in a ditchunder a hedge. On down the road she ran and appeared at the door of aneighbour, screaming and calling for help.</p><p> The story of the fight in the road got to Caxton just as Sam came out ofthe corner, back of the stove in Wildman's and appeared on the street. Menran from store to store and from group to group along the street sayingthat the young farmer had died and that murder had been done. On a streetcorner Windy McPherson harangued the crowd declaring that the men ofCaxton should arise in the defence of their homes and string the murdererto a lamp post. Hop Higgins, driving a horse from Culvert's livery,appeared on Main Street. "He will be at the McCarthy farm," he shouted.When several men, coming out of Geiger's drug store, stopped the marshal'shorse, saying, "You will have trouble out there; you had better takehelp," the little red-faced marshal with the crippled leg laughed. "Whattrouble?" he asked--"To get Mike McCarthy? I shall ask him to come and hewill come. The rest of that lot won't cut any figure. Mike can wrap theentire McCarthy family around his finger."</p><p> There were six of the McCarthy men, all, except Mike, silent, sullen menwho only talked when they were in liquor. Mike furnished the town's socialtouch with the family. It was a strange family to live there in that fat,corn-growing country, a family with something savage and primitive aboutit, one that belonged among western mining camps or among the half savagedwellers in deep alleys in cities, and the fact that it lived on a cornfarm in Iowa was, in the words of John Telfer, "something monstrous inNature."</p><p> The McCarthy farm, lying some four miles east of Caxton, had oncecontained a thousand acres of good corn-growing land. Lem McCarthy, thefather of the family, had inherited it from a brother, a gold miner, aforty-niner, a sport owning fast horses, who planned to breed race horseson the Iowa land. Lem had come out of the back streets of an eastern city,bringing his brood of tall, silent, savage boys to live upon the land and,like the forty-niner, to be a sport. Thinking the wealth that had come tohim vast beyond spending, he had plunged into horse racing and gambling.When, within two years, five hundred acres of the farm had to be sold topay gambling debts, and the wide acres lay covered with weeds, Lem becamealarmed, and settled down to hard work, the boys working all day in thefield and at long intervals coming into town at night to get into trouble.Having no mother or sister, and knowing that no Caxton woman could behired to go upon the place, they did their own housework; and on rainydays sat about the old farmhouse playing cards and fighting. On other daysthey would stand around the bar in Art Sherman's saloon in Piety Hollowdrinking until they had lost their savage silence and had become loud andquarrelsome, going from there upon the streets to seek trouble. Once,going into Hayner's restaurant, they took stacks of plates from shelvesback of the counter and, standing in the doorway, threw them at peoplepassing in the street, the crash of the breaking crockery accompanyingtheir roaring laughter. When they had driven the people to cover they gotupon their horses and with wild shouts raced up and down Main Streetbetween the rows of tied horses until Hop Higgins, the town marshal,appeared, when they rode off into the country awakening the farmers alongthe darkened road as they fled, shouting and singing, toward home.</p><p> When the McCarthy boys got into trouble in Caxton, old Lem McCarthy droveinto town and got them out of it, paying for the damage done and goingabout declaring the boys meant no harm. When told to keep them out of townhe shook his head and said he would try.</p><p> Mike McCarthy did not ride swearing and singing with the five brothersalong the dark road. He did not work all day in the hot corn fields. Hewas the family gentleman, and, wearing good clothes, strolled instead uponthe street or loitered in the shade before the New Leland House. Mike hadbeen educated. For some years he had attended a college in Indiana fromwhich he was expelled for an affair with a woman. After his return fromcollege he stayed in Caxton, living at the hotel and making a pretence ofstudying law in the office of old Judge Reynolds. He paid slight attentionto the study of law, but with infinite patience had so trained his handsthat he became wonderfully dexterous with coins and cards, plucking themout of the air and making them appear in the shoes, the hats, and even inthe mouths, of bystanders. During the day he walked the streets looking atthe girl clerks in the stores, or stood upon the station platform wavinghis hand to women passengers on passing trains. He told John Telfer thatthe flattery of women was a lost art that he intended to restore. MikeMcCarthy carried in his pockets books which he read sitting in a chairbefore the hotel or on the stones before store windows. When on Saturdaysthe streets were filled with people, he stood on the corners givinggratuitous performances of his magical art with cards and coins, andeyeing country girls in the crowd. Once, a woman, the town stationer'swife, shouted at him, calling him a lazy lout, whereupon he threw a coinin the air, and when it did not come down rushed toward her shouting, "Shehas it in her stocking." When the stationer's wife ran into her shop andbanged the door the crowd laughed and shouted with delight.</p><p> Telfer had a liking for the tall, grey-eyed, loitering McCarthy andsometimes sat with him discussing a novel or a poem; Sam in the backgroundlistened eagerly. Valmore did not care for the man, shaking his head anddeclaring that such a fellow could come to no good end.</p><p> The rest of the town agreed with Valmore, and McCarthy, knowing this,sunned himself in the town's displeasure. For the sake of the public furorit brought down upon his head he proclaimed himself a socialist, ananarchist, an atheist, a pagan. Among all the McCarthy boys he alone caredgreatly about women, and he made public and open declarations of hispassion for them. Before the men gathered about the stove in Wildman'sgrocery store he would stand whipping them into a frenzy by declaring forfree love, and vowing that he would have the best of any woman who gavehim the chance.</p><p> For this man the frugal, hard working newsboy had conceived a regardamounting to a passion. As he listened to McCarthy he got continuousdelightful little thrills. "There is nothing he would not dare," thoughtthe boy. "He is the freest, the boldest, the bravest man in town." Whenthe young Irishman, seeing the admiration in his eyes, flung him a silverdollar saying, "That is for your fine brown eyes, my boy; it I had them Iwould have half the women in town after me," Sam kept the dollar in hispocket and counted it a kind of treasure like the rose given a lover byhis sweetheart.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> It was past eleven o'clock when Hop Higgins returned to town withMcCarthy, driving quietly along the street and through an alley at theback of the town hall. The crowd upon the street had broken up. Sam hadgone from one to another of the muttering groups, his heart quaking withfear. Now he stood at the back of the mass of men gathered at the jaildoor. An oil lamp, burning at the top of the post above the door, threwdancing, flickering lights on the faces of the men before him. The thunderstorm that had threatened had not come, but the unnatural warm windcontinued and the sky overhead was inky black.</p><p> Through the alley, to the jail door, drove the town marshal, the youngMcCarthy sitting in the buggy beside him. A man rushed forward to hold thehorse. McCarthy's face was chalky white. He laughed and shouted, raisinghis hand toward the sky.</p><p> "I am Michael, son of God. I have cut a man with a knife so that his redblood ran upon the ground. I am the son of God and this filthy jail shallbe my sanctuary. In there I shall talk aloud with my Father," he roaredhoarsely, shaking his fist at the crowd. "Sons of this cesspool ofrespectability, stay and hear! Send for your females and let them stand inthe presence of a man!"</p><p> Taking the white, wild-eyed man by the arm Marshal Higgins led him intothe jail, the clank of locks, the low murmur of the voice of Higgins andthe wild laughter of McCarthy floating out to the group of silent menstanding in the mud of the alley.</p><p> Sam McPherson ran past the group of men to the side of the jail andfinding John Telfer and Valmore leaning silently against the wall of TomFolger's wagon shop slipped between them. Telfer put out his arm and laidit upon the boy's shoulder. Hop Higgins, coming out of the jail, addressedthe crowd. "Don't answer if he talks," he said; "he is as crazy as aloon."</p><p> Sam moved closer to Telfer. The voice of the imprisoned man, loud, andfilled with a startling boldness, rolled out of the jail. He beganpraying.</p><p> "Hear me, Father Almighty, who has permitted this town of Caxton to existand has let me, Thy son, grow to manhood. I am Michael, Thy son. They haveput me in this jail where rats run across the floor and they stand in themud outside as I talk with Thee. Are you there, old Truepenny?"</p><p> A breath of cold air blew up the alley followed by a flaw of rain. Thegroup under the flickering lamp by the jail entrance drew back against thewalls of the building. Sam could see them dimly, pressing closely againstthe wall. The man in the jail laughed loudly.</p><p> "I have had a philosophy of life, O Father," he shouted. "I have seen menand women here living year after year without children. I have seen themhoarding pennies and denying Thee new life on which to work Thy will. Tothese women I have gone secretly talking of carnal love. With them I havebeen gentle and kind; them I have flattered."</p><p> A roaring laugh broke from the lips of the imprisoned man. "Are you there,oh dwellers in the cesspool of respectability?" he shouted. "Do you standin the mud with cold feet listening? I have been with your wives. ElevenCaxton wives without babes have I been with and it has been fruitless. Thetwelfth woman I have just left, leaving her man in the road a bleedingsacrifice to thee. I shall call out the names of the eleven. I shall haverevenge also upon the husbands of the women, some of whom wait with theothers in the mud outside."</p><p> He began calling off the names of Caxton wives. A shudder ran through thebody of the boy, sensitised by the new chill in the air and by theexcitement of the night. Among the men standing along the wall of the jaila murmur arose. Again they grouped themselves under the flickering lightby the jail door, disregarding the rain. Valmore, stumbling out of thedarkness beside Sam, stood before Telfer. "The boy should be going home,"he said; "this isn't fit for him to hear."</p><p> Telfer laughed and drew Sam closer to him. "He has heard enough lies inthis town," he said. "Truth won't hurt him. I would not go myself, norwould you, and the boy shall not go. This McCarthy has a brain. Althoughhe is half insane now he is trying to work something out. The boy and Iwill stay to hear."</p><p> The voice from the jail continued calling out the names of Caxton wives.Voices in the group before the jail door began shouting: "This should bestopped. Let us tear down the jail."</p><p> McCarthy laughed aloud. "They squirm, oh Father, they squirm; I have themin the pit and I torture them," he cried.</p><p> An ugly feeling of satisfaction came over Sam. He had a sense of the factthat the names shouted from the jail would be repeated over and overthrough the town. One of the women whose names had been called out hadstood with the evangelist at the back of the church trying to induce thewife of the baker to rise and be counted in the fold with the lambs.</p><p> The rain, falling on the shoulders of the men by the jail door, changed tohail, the air grew colder and the hailstones rattled on the roofs ofbuildings. Some of the men joined Telfer and Valmore, talking in low,excited voices. "And Mary McKane, too, the hypocrite," Sam heard one ofthem say.</p><p> The voice inside the jail changed. Still praying, Mike McCarthy seemedalso to be talking to the group in the darkness outside.</p><p> "I am sick of my life. I have sought leadership and have not found it. OhFather! Send down to men a new Christ, one to get hold of us, a modernChrist with a pipe in his mouth who will swear and knock us about so thatwe vermin who pretend to be made in Thy image will understand. Let him gointo churches and into courthouses, into cities, and into towns like this,shouting, 'Be ashamed! Be ashamed of your cowardly concern over yoursnivelling souls!' Let him tell us that never will our lives, so miserablylived, be repeated after our bodies lie rotting in the grave."</p><p> A sob broke from his lips and a lump came into Sam's throat.</p><p> "Oh Father! help us men of Caxton to understand that we have only this,our lives, this life so warm and hopeful and laughing in the sun, thislife with its awkward boys full of strange possibilities, and its girlswith their long legs and freckles on their noses, that are meant to carrylife within themselves, new life, kicking and stirring, and waking them atnight."</p><p> The voice of the prayer broke. Wild sobs took the place of speech."Father!" shouted the broken voice, "I have taken a life, a man that movedand talked and whistled in the sunshine on winter mornings; I havekilled."</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> The voice inside the jail became inaudible. Silence, broken by low sobsfrom the jail, fell on the little dark alley and the listening men begangoing silently away. The lump in Sam's throat grew larger. Tears stood inhis eyes. He went with Telfer and Valmore out of the alley and into thestreet, the two men walking in silence. The rain had ceased and a coldwind blew.</p><p> The boy felt that he had been shriven. His mind, his heart, even his tiredbody seemed strangely cleansed. He felt a new affection for Telfer andValmore. When Telfer began talking he listened eagerly, thinking that atlast he understood him and knew why men like Valmore, Wildman, FreedomSmith, and Telfer loved each other and went on being friends year afteryear in the face of difficulties and misunderstandings. He thought that hehad got hold of the idea of brotherhood that John Telfer talked of sooften and so eloquently. "Mike McCarthy is only a brother who has gone thedark road," he thought and felt a glow of pride in the thought and in theapt expression of it in his mind.</p><p> John Telfer, forgetting the boy, talked soberly to Valmore, the two menstumbling along in the darkness intent upon their own thoughts.</p><p> "It is an odd thought," said Telfer and his voice seemed far away andunnatural like the voice from the jail; "it is an odd thought that but fora quirk in the brain this Mike McCarthy might himself have been a kind ofChrist with a pipe in his mouth."</p><p> Valmore stumbled and half fell in the darkness at a street crossing.Telfer went on talking.</p><p> "The world will some day grope its way into some kind of an understandingof its extraordinary men. Now they suffer terribly. In success or in suchfailures as has come to this imaginative, strangely perverted Irishmantheir lot is pitiful. It is only the common, the plain, unthinking man whoslides peacefully through this troubled world."</p><p> At the house Jane McPherson sat waiting for her boy. She was thinking ofthe scene in the church and a hard light was in her eyes. Sam went pastthe sleeping room of his parents, where Windy McPherson snored peacefully,and up the stairway to his own room. He undressed and, putting out thelight, knelt upon the floor. From the wild ravings of the man in the jailhe had got hold of something. In the midst of the blasphemy of MikeMcCarthy he had sensed a deep and abiding love of life. Where the churchhad failed the bold sensualist succeeded. Sam felt that he could haveprayed in the presence of the entire town.</p><p> "Oh, Father!" he cried, sending up his voice in the silence of the littleroom, "make me stick to the thought that the right living of this, mylife, is my duty to you."</p><p> By the door below, while Valmore waited on the sidewalk, Telfer talked toJane McPherson.</p><p> "I wanted Sam to hear," he explained. "He needs a religion. All young menneed a religion. I wanted him to hear how even a man like Mike McCarthykeeps instinctively trying to justify himself before God."</p><h2>Book I - Chapter 4</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> John Telfer's friendship was a formative influence upon Sam McPherson. Hisfather's worthlessness and the growing realisation of the hardship of his</p><p> mother's position had given life a bitter taste in his mouth, and Telfersweetened it. He entered with zeal into Sam's thoughts and dreams, andtried valiantly to arouse in the quiet, industrious, money-making boy someof his own love of life and beauty. At night, as the two walked downcountry roads, the man would stop and, waving his arms about, quote Poe orBrowning or, in another mood, would compel Sam's attention to the raresmell of a hayfield or to a moonlit stretch of meadow.</p><p> Before people gathered on the streets he teased the boy, calling him alittle money grubber and saying, "He is like a little mole that worksunderground. As the mole goes for a worm so this boy goes for a five-centpiece. I have watched him. A travelling man goes out of town leaving astray dime or nickel here and within an hour it is in this boy's pocket. Ihave talked to banker Walker of him. He trembles lest his vaults becometoo small to hold the wealth of this young Croesus. The day will come whenhe will buy the town and put it into his vest pocket."</p><p> For all his public teasing of the boy Telfer had the genius to adopt adifferent attitude when they were alone together. Then he talked to himopenly and freely as he talked to Valmore and Freedom Smith and to othercronies of his on the streets of Caxton. Walking along the road he wouldpoint with his cane to the town and say, "You and that mother of yourshave more of the real stuff in you than the rest of the boys and mothersof the town put together."</p><p> In all Caxton Telfer was the only man who knew books and who took themseriously. Sam sometimes found his attitude toward them puzzling and wouldstand with open mouth listening as Telfer swore or laughed at a book as hedid at Valmore or Freedom Smith. He had a fine portrait of Browning whichhe kept hung in the stable and before this he would stand, his legs spreadapart, and his head tilted to one side, talking.</p><p> "A rich old sport you are, eh?" he would say, grinning. "Getting yourselfdiscussed by women and college professors in clubs, eh? You old fraud!"</p><p> Toward Mary Underwood, the school teacher who had become Sam's friend andwith whom the boy sometimes walked and talked, Telfer had no charity. MaryUnderwood was a sort of cinder in the eyes of Caxton. She was the onlychild of Silas Underwood, the town harness maker, who once had worked in ashop belonging to Windy McPherson. After the business failure of Windy hehad started independently and for a time did well, sending his daughter toa school in Massachusetts. Mary did not understand the people of Caxtonand the people misunderstood and distrusted her. Taking no part in thelife of the town and keeping to herself and to her books she awoke a kindof fear in others. Because she did not join them at church suppers, or gofrom porch to porch gossiping with other women through the long summerevenings, they thought her something abnormal. On Sundays she sat alone inher pew at church and on Saturday afternoons, come storm, come sunshine,she walked on country roads and through the woods accompanied by a colliedog. She was a small woman with a straight, slender figure and had fineblue eyes filled with changing lights, hidden by the eye-glasses shealmost constantly wore. Her lips were very full and red, and she sat withthem parted so that the edges of her fine teeth showed. Her nose waslarge, and a fine reddish-brown colour glowed in her cheeks. Thoughdifferent, she had, like Jane McPherson, a habit of silence; and under hersilence, she, like Sam's mother, possessed an unusually strong andvigorous mind.</p><p> As a child she was a sort of half invalid and had not been on friendlyfooting with other children. It was then that her habit of silence andreticence had been established. The years in the school in Massachusettsrestored her health but did not break this habit. She came home and tookthe place in the schools to earn money with which to take her back East,dreaming of a position as instructor in an eastern college. She was thatrare thing, a woman scholar, loving scholarship for its own sake.</p><p> Mary Underwood's position in the town and in the schools was insecure. Outof her silent, independent way of life had sprung a misunderstanding that,at least once, had taken definite form and had come near driving her fromthe town and schools. That she did not succumb to the storm of criticismthat for some weeks beat about her head was due to her habit of silenceand to a determination to get her own way in the face of everything.</p><p> It was a suggestion of scandal that had put the grey hairs upon her head.The scandal had blown over before the time of her friendship for Sam, buthe had known of it. In those days he knew of everything that went on inthe town--his quick ears and eyes missed nothing. More than once he hadheard the men waiting to be shaved in Sawyer's barber shop speak of her.</p><p> The tale ran that she had been involved in an affair with a real estateagent who had afterward left town. It was said that the man, a tall, finelooking fellow, had been in love with Mary and had wanted to desert hiswife and go away with her. One night he had driven to Mary's house in aclosed buggy and the two had driven into the country. They had sat forhours in the covered buggy at the side of the road and talked, and peopledriving past had seen them there talking together.</p><p> And then she had got out of the buggy and walked home alone through snowdrifts. The next day she was at school as usual. When told of it theschool superintendent, a puttering old fellow with vacant eyes, had shakenhis head in alarm and declared that it must be looked into. He called Maryinto his little narrow office in the school building, but lost couragewhen she sat before him, and said nothing. The man in the barber shop, whorepeated the tale, said that the real estate man drove on to a distantstation and took a train to the city, and that some days later he cameback to Caxton and moved his family out of town.</p><p> Sam dismissed the story from his mind. Having begun a friendship for Maryhe put the man in the barber shop into a class with Windy McPherson andthought of him as a pretender and liar who talked for the sake of talk. Heremembered with a shock the crude levity with which the loafers in theshop had greeted the repetition of the tale. Their comments had come backto his mind as he walked through the streets with his newspapers and hadgiven him a kind of jolt. He went along under the trees thinking of thesunlight falling upon the grey hair as they walked together on summerafternoons, and bit his lip and opened and closed his fist convulsively.</p><p> During Mary's second year in the Caxton schools her mother died, and atthe end of another year, her father, failing in the harness business, Marybecame a fixture in the schools. The house at the edge of the town, theproperty of her mother, had come down to her and she lived there with anold aunt. After the passing of the wind of scandal concerning the realestate man the town lost interest in her. She was thirty-six at the timeof her first friendship with Sam and lived alone among her books.</p><p> Sam had been deeply moved by her friendship. It had seemed to himsomething significant that grown people with affairs of their own shouldbe so in earnest about his future as she and Telfer were. Boylike, hecounted it a tribute to himself rather than to the winsome youth in him,and was made proud by it. Having no real feeling for books, and onlypretending to have out of a desire to please, he sometimes went from oneto the other of his two friends, passing off their opinions as his own.</p><p> At this trick Telfer invariably caught him. "That is not your notion," hewould shout, "you have it from that school teacher. It is the opinion of awoman. Their opinions, like the books they sometimes write, are founded onnothing. They are not the real things. Women know nothing. Men only carefor them because they have not had what they want from them. No woman isreally big--except maybe my woman, Eleanor."</p><p> When Sam continued to be much in the company of Mary, Telfer grew morebitter.</p><p> "I would have you observe women's minds and avoid letting them influenceyour own," he told the boy. "They live in a world of unrealities. Theylike even vulgar people in books, but shrink from the simple, earthy folkabout them. That school teacher is so. Is she like me? Does she, whileloving books, love also the very smell of human life?"</p><p> In a way Telfer's attitude toward the kindly little school teacher becameSam's attitude. Although they walked and talked together the course ofstudy she had planned for him he never took up and as he grew to know herbetter, the books she read and the ideas she advanced appealed to him lessand less. He thought that she, as Telfer held, lived in a world ofillusion and unreality and said so. When she lent him books, he put themin his pocket and did not read them. When he did read, he thought thebooks reminded him of something that hurt him. They were in some way falseand pretentious. He thought they were like his father. One day he triedreading aloud to Telfer from a book Mary Underwood had lent him.</p><p> The story was one of a poetic man with long, unclean fingernails who wentamong people preaching the doctrine of beauty. It began with a scene on ahillside in a rainstorm where the poetic man sat under a tent writing aletter to his sweetheart.</p><p> Telfer was beside himself. Jumping from his seat under a tree by theroadside he waved his arms and shouted:</p><p> "Stop! Stop it! Do not go on with it. The story lies. A man could notwrite love letters under the circumstances and he was a fool to pitch histent on a hillside. A man in a tent on a hillside in a storm would be coldand wet and getting the rheumatism. To be writing letters he would need tobe an unspeakable ass. He had better be out digging a trench to keep thewater from running through his tent."</p><p> Waving his arms, Telfer went off up the road and Sam followed thinking himaltogether right, and, if later in life he learned that there are men whocould write love letters on a piece of housetop in a flood, he did notknow it then and the least suggestion of windiness or pretence lay heavyin his stomach.</p><p> Telfer had a vast enthusiasm for Bellamy's "Looking Backward," and read italoud to his wife on Sunday afternoons, sitting under the apple trees inthe garden. They had a fund of little personal jokes and sayings that theywere forever laughing over, and she had infinite delight in his commentson the life and people of Caxton, but did not share his love of books.When she sometimes went to sleep in her chair during the Sunday afternoonreadings he poked her with his cane and laughingly told her to wake up andlisten to the dream of a great dreamer. Among Browning's verses hisfavourites were "A Light Woman" and "Fra Lippo Lippi," and he would recitethese aloud with great gusto. He declared Mark Twain the greatest man inthe world and in certain moods he would walk the road beside Sam recitingover and over one or two lines of verse, often this from Poe:</p><p> Helen, thy beauty is to me Like some Nicean bark of yore.</p><p> Then, stopping and turning upon the boy, he would demand whether or notthe writing of such lines wasn't worth living a life for.</p><p> Telfer had a pack of dogs that always went with them on their walks atnight and he had for them long Latin names that Sam could never remember.One summer be bought a trotting mare from Lem McCarthy and gave greatattention to the colt, which he named Bellamy Boy, trotting him up anddown a little driveway by the side of his house for hours at a time anddeclaring he would be a great trotting horse. He could recite the colt'spedigree with great gusto and when he had been talking to Sam of some bookhe would repay the boy's attention by saying, "You, my boy, are as farsuperior to the run of boys about town as the colt, Bellamy Boy, issuperior to the farm horses that are hitched along Main Street on Saturdayafternoons." And then, with a wave of his hand and a look of muchseriousness on his face, he would add, "And for the same reason. You havebeen, like him, under a master trainer of youth."</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> One evening Sam, now grown to man's stature and full of the awkwardnessand self-consciousness of his new growth, was sitting on a cracker barrelat the back of Wildman's grocery. It was a summer evening and a breezeblew through the open doors swaying the hanging oil lamps that burned andsputtered overhead. As usual he was listening in silence to the talk thatwent on among the men.</p><p> Standing with legs wide apart and from time to time jabbing with his caneat Sam's legs, John Telfer held forth on the subject of love.</p><p> "It is a theme that poets do well to write of," he declared. "In writingof it they avoid the necessity of embracing it. In trying for a wellturned line they forget to look at well-turned ankles. He who sings mostpassionately of love has been in love the least; he woos the goddess ofpoesy and only gets into trouble when he, like John Keats, turns to thedaughter of a villager and tries to live the lines he has written."</p><p> "Stuff and nonsense," roared Freedom Smith, who had been sitting tiltedfar back in a chair with his feet against the cold stove, smoking a short,black pipe, and who now brought his feet down upon the floor with a bang.Admiring Telfer's flow of words he pretended to be filled with scorn. "Thenight is too hot for eloquence," he bellowed. "If you must be eloquenttalk of ice cream or mint juleps or recite a verse about the old swimmingpool."</p><p> Telfer, wetting his finger, thrust it into the air.</p><p> "The wind is in the north-west; the beasts roar; we will have a storm," hesaid, winking at Valmore.</p><p> Banker Walker came into the store, followed by his daughter. She was asmall, dark-skinned girl with black, quick eyes. Seeing Sam sitting withswinging legs upon the cracker barrel she spoke to her father and went outof the store. At the sidewalk she stopped and, turning, made a quickmotion with her hand.</p><p> Sam jumped off the cracker barrel and strolled toward the street door. Aflush was on his cheeks. His mouth felt hot and dry. He went with extremedeliberateness, stopping to bow to the banker, and for a moment lingeringto read a newspaper that lay upon the cigar case, to avoid the comments hefeared his going might excite among the men by the stove. In his heart hetrembled lest the girl should have disappeared down the street, and withhis eyes, he looked guiltily at the banker, who had joined the group atthe back of the store and who now stood listening to the talk, while heread from a list held in his hand and Wildman went here and there doing uppackages and repeating aloud the names of articles called off by thebanker.</p><p> At the end of the lighted business section of Main Street, Sam found thegirl waiting for him. She began to tell of the subterfuge by which she hadescaped her father.</p><p> "I told him I would go home with my sister," she said, tossing her head.</p><p> Taking hold of the boy's hand, she led him along the shaded street. Forthe first time Sam walked in the company of one of the strange beings thathad begun to bring him uneasy nights, and overcome with the wonder of itthe blood climbed through his body and made his head reel so that hewalked in silence unable to understand his own emotions. He felt the softhand of the girl with delight; his heart pounded against the walls of hischest and a choking sensation gripped at his throat.</p><p> Walking along the street, past lighted residences where the low voices ofwomen in talk greeted his ears, Sam was inordinately proud. He thoughtthat he should like to turn and walk with this girl through the lightedMain Street. Had she not chosen him from among all the boys of the town;had she not, with a flutter of her little, white hand, called to him witha call that he wondered the men upon the cracker barrels had not heard?Her boldness and his own took his breath away. He could not talk. Histongue seemed paralysed.</p><p> Down the street went the boy and girl, loitering in the shadows, hurryingpast the dim oil lamps at street crossings, getting from each other waveafter wave of exquisite little thrills. Neither spoke. They were beyondwords. Had they not together done this daring thing?</p><p> In the shadow of a tree they stopped and stood facing each other; the girllooked at the ground and stood facing the boy. Putting out his hand helaid it upon her shoulder. In the darkness on the other side of the streeta man stumbled homeward along a board sidewalk. The lights of Main Streetglowed in the distance. Sam drew the girl toward him. She raised her head.Their lips met, and then, throwing her arms about his neck, she kissed himagain and again eagerly.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> Sam's return to Wildman's was marked by extreme caution. Although he hadbeen absent but fifteen minutes it seemed to him that hours must havepassed and he would not have been surprised to see the stores locked anddarkness settled down on Main Street. It was inconceivable that the grocercould still be wrapping packages for banker Walker. Worlds had beenremade. Manhood had come to him. Why! the man should have wrapped theentire store, package after package, and sent it to the ends of the earth.He lingered in the shadows at the first of the store lights where agesbefore he had gone, a mere boy, to meet her, a mere girl, and looked withwonder at the lighted way before him.</p><p> Sam crossed the street and, from the front of Sawyer's barber shop, lookedinto Wildman's. He felt like a spy looking into the camp of an enemy.There before him sat the men into whose midst he had it in his power tocast a thunderbolt. He might walk to the door and say, truthfully enough,"Here before you is a boy that by the flutter of a white hand has beenmade into a man; here is one who has wrung the heart of womankind andeaten his fill at the tree of the knowledge of life."</p><p> In the grocery the talk still continued among the men upon the crackerbarrels who seemed unconscious of the boy's slinking entrance. Indeed,their talk had sunk. From talking of love and of poets they talked of cornand of steers. Banker Walker, his packages of groceries lying on thecounter, smoked a cigar.</p><p> "You can fairly hear the corn growing to-night," he said. "It wants butanother shower or two and we shall have a record crop. I plan to feed ahundred steers at my farm out Rabbit Road this winter."</p><p> The boy climbed again upon a cracker barrel and tried to look unconcernedand interested in the talk. Still his heart thumped; still a throbbingwent on in his wrists. He turned and looked at the floor hoping hisagitation would pass unnoticed.</p><p> The banker, taking up the packages, walked out at the door. Valmore andFreedom Smith went over to the livery barn for a game of pinochle. AndJohn Telfer, twirling his cane and calling to a troup of dogs thatloitered in an alley back of the store, took Sam for a walk into thecountry.</p><p> "I will continue this talk of love," said Telfer, striking at weeds alongthe road with his cane and from time to time calling sharply to the dogsthat, filled with delight at being abroad, ran growling and tumbling overeach other in the dusty road.</p><p> "That Freedom Smith is a sample of life in this town. At the word love hedrops his feet upon the floor and pretends to be filled with disgust. Hewill talk of corn or steers or of the stinking hides that he buys, but atthe mention of the word love he is like a hen that has seen a hawk in thesky. He runs about in circles making a fuss. 'Here! Here! Here!' he cries,'you are making public something that should be kept hidden. You are doingin the light of day what should only be done with a shamed face in adarkened room.' Why, boy, if I were a woman in this town I would not standit--I would go to New York, to France, to Paris--To be wooed for but apassing moment by a shame-faced yokel without art--uh--it is unthinkable."</p><p> The man and the boy walked in silence. The dogs, scenting a rabbit,disappeared across a long pasture, their master letting them go. From timeto time he threw back his head and took long breaths of the night air.</p><p> "I am not like banker Walker," he declared. "He thinks of the growing cornin terms of fat steers feeding on the Rabbit Run farm; I think of it assomething majestic. I see the long corn rows with the men and the horseshalf hidden, hot and breathless, and I think of a vast river of life. Icatch a breath of the flame that was in the mind of the man who said, 'Theland is flowing with milk and honey.' I am made happy by my thoughts notby the dollars clinking in my pocket.</p><p> "And then in the fall when the corn stands shocked I see another picture.Here and there in companies stand the armies of the corn. It puts a ringin my voice to look at them. 'These orderly armies has mankind brought outof chaos,' I say to myself. 'On a smoking black ball flung by the hand ofGod out of illimitable space has man stood up these armies to defend hishome against the grim attacking armies of want.'"</p><p> Telfer stopped and stood in the road with his legs spread apart. He tookoff his hat and throwing back his head laughed up at the stars.</p><p> "Freedom Smith should hear me now," he cried, rocking back and forth withlaughter and switching his cane at the boy's legs so that Sam had to hopmerrily about in the road to avoid it. "Flung by the hand of God out ofillimitable space--eh! not bad, eh! I should be in Congress. I am wastedhere. I am throwing priceless eloquence to dogs who prefer to chaserabbits and to a boy who is the worst little money grubber in the town."</p><p> The midsummer madness that had seized Telfer passed and for a time hewalked in silence. Suddenly, putting his arm on the boy's shoulder, hestopped and pointed to where a faint light in the sky marked the lightedtown.</p><p> "They are good people," he said, "but their ways are not my ways or yourways. You will go out of the town. You have genius. You will be a man offinance. I have watched you. You are not niggardly and you do not cheatand lie--result--you will not be a little business man. What have you? Youhave the gift of seeing dollars where the rest of the boys of the town seenothing and you are tireless after those dollars--you will be a big man ofdollars, it is plain." Into his voice came a touch of bitterness. "I alsowas marked out. Why do I carry a cane? why do I not buy a farm and raisesteers? I am the most worthless thing alive. I have the touch of geniuswithout the energy to make it count."</p><p> Sam's mind that had been inflamed by the kiss of the girl cooled in thepresence of Telfer. In the summer madness of the talking man there wassomething soothing to the fever in his blood. He followed the wordseagerly, seeing pictures, getting thrills, filled with happiness.</p><p> At the edge of town a buggy passed the walking pair. In the buggy sat ayoung farmer, his arm about the waist of a girl, her head upon hisshoulder. Far in the distance sounded the faint call of the dogs. Sam andTelfer sat down on a grassy bank under a tree while Telfer rolled andlighted a cigarette.</p><p> "As I promised, I will talk to you of love," he said, making a wide sweepwith his arm each time as he put his cigarette into his mouth.</p><p> The grassy bank on which they lay had the rich, burned smell of the hotdays. A wind rustled the standing corn that formed a kind of wall behindthem. The moon was in the sky and shone down across bank after bank ofserried clouds. The grandiloquence went out of the voice of Telfer and hisface became serious.</p><p> "My foolishness is more than half earnest," he said. "I think that a manor boy who has set for himself a task had better let women and girlsalone. If he be a man of genius, he has a purpose independent of all theworld, and should cut and slash and pound his way toward his mark,forgetting every one, particularly the woman that would come to grips withhim. She also has a mark toward which she goes. She is at war with him andhas a purpose that is not his purpose. She believes that the pursuit ofwomen is an end for a life. For all they now condemn Mike McCarthy whowent to the asylum because of them and who, while loving life, came nearto taking life, the women of Caxton do not condemn his madness forthemselves; they do not blame him for loitering away his good years or formaking an abortive mess of his good brain. While he made an art of thepursuit of women they applauded secretly. Did not twelve of them acceptthe challenge thrown out by his eyes as he loitered in the streets?"</p><p> The man, who had begun talking quietly and seriously, raised his voice andwaved the lighted cigarette in the air and the boy who had begun to thinkagain of the dark-skinned daughter of banker Walker listened attentively.The barking of the dogs grew nearer.</p><p> "If you as a boy can get from me, a grown man, an understanding of thepurpose of women you will not have lived in this town for nothing. Setyour mark at money making if you will, but drive at that. Let yourself butgo and a sweet wistful pair of eyes seen in a street crowd or a pair oflittle feet running over a dance floor will retard your growth for years.No man or boy can grow toward the purpose of a life while he thinks ofwomen. Let him try it and he will be undone. What is to him a passinghumour is to them an end. They are diabolically clever. They will run andstop and run and stop again, keeping just without his reach. He sees themhere and there about him. His mind is filled with vague, deliciousthoughts that come out of the very air; before he realises what he hasdone he has spent his years in vain pursuit and turning finds himself oldand undone."</p><p> Telfer began jabbing at the ground with his stick.</p><p> "I had my chance. In New York I had money to live on and time to have madean artist of myself. I won prize after prize. The master, walking up anddown back of us, lingered longest over my easel. There was a fellow satbeside me who had nothing. I made sport of him and called him Sleepy Jockafter a dog we used to have about our house here in Caxton. Now I am hereidly waiting for death and that Jock, where is he? Only last week I saw ina paper that he had won a place among the world's great artists by apicture he has painted. In the school I watched for a look in the eyes ofthe girl students and went about with them night after night winning, likeMike McCarthy, fruitless victories. Sleepy Jock had the best of it. He didnot look about with open eyes but kept peering instead at the face of themaster. My days were full of small successes. I could wear clothes. Icould make soft-eyed girls turn to look at me in a dance hall. I remembera night. We students gave a dance and Sleepy Jock came. He went aboutasking for dances and the girls laughed and told him they had none togive, that the dances were taken. I followed him and had my ears filledwith flattery and my card with names. In riding the wave of small successI got the habit of small success. When I could not catch the line I wantedto make a drawing live, I dropped my pencil and, taking a girl upon myarm, went for a day in the country. Once, sitting in a restaurant, Ioverheard two women talking of the beauty of my eyes and was made happyfor a week."</p><p> Telfer threw up his hands in disgust.</p><p> "My flow of words, my ready trick of talking; to what does it bring me?Let me tell you. It has brought me to this--that at fifty I, who mighthave been an artist fixing the minds of thousands upon some thing ofbeauty or of truth, have become a village cut-up, a pot-house wit, aflinger of idle words into the air of a village intent upon raising corn.</p><p> "If you ask me why, I tell you that my mind was paralysed by small successand if you ask me where I got the taste for that, I tell you that I got itwhen I saw it lurking in a woman's eyes and heard the pleasant littlesongs that lull to sleep upon a woman's lips."</p><p> The boy, sitting upon the grassy bank beside Telfer, began thinking oflife in Caxton. The man smoking the cigarette fell into one of his raresilences. The boy thought of girls that had come into his mind at night,of how he had been thrilled by a glance from the eyes of a little blueeyed school girl who had once visited at Freedom Smith's home and of howhe had gone at night to stand under her window.</p><p> In Caxton adolescent love had about it a virility befitting a land thatraised so many bushels of yellow corn and drove so many fat steers throughthe streets to be loaded upon cars. Men and women went their waysbelieving, with characteristic American what-boots-it attitude toward theneeds of childhood, that it was well for growing boys and girls to be muchalone together. To leave them alone together was a principle with them.When a young man called upon his sweetheart, her parents sat in thepresence of the two with apologetic eyes and presently disappeared leavingthem alone together. When boys' and girls' parties were given in Caxtonhouses, parents went away leaving the children to shift for themselves.</p><p> "Now have a good time and don't tear the house down," they said, going offupstairs.</p><p> Left to themselves the children played kissing games and young men andtall half-formed girls sat on the front porches in the darkness, thrilledand half frightened, getting through their instincts, crudely and withoutguidance, their first peep at the mystery of life. They kissedpassionately and the young men, walking home, lay upon their beds feveredand unnaturally aroused, thinking thoughts.</p><p> Young men went into the company of girls time and again without knowingaught of them except that they caused a stirring of their whole being, akind of riot of the senses to which they returned on other evenings as adrunkard to his cups. After such an evening they found themselves, on thenext morning, confused and filled with vague longings. They had lost theirkeenness for fun, they heard without hearing the talk of the men about thestation and in the stores, they went slinking through the streets ingroups and people seeing them nodded their heads and said, "It is theloutish age."</p><p> If Sam did not have a loutish age it was due to his tireless struggle toincrease the totals at the foot of the pages in the yellow bankbook, tothe growing ill health of his mother that had begun to frighten him, andto the society of Valmore, Wildman, Freedom Smith, and the man who now satmusing beside him. He began to think he would have nothing more to do withthe Walker girl. He remembered his sister's affair with a young farmer andshuddered at the crude vulgarity of it. He looked over the shoulder of theman sitting beside him absorbed in thought, and saw the rolling fieldsstretched away in the moonlight and into his mind came Telfer's speech. Sovivid, so moving, seemed the picture of the armies of standing corn whichmen had set up in the fields to protect themselves against the march ofpitiless Nature, and Sam, holding the picture in his mind as he followedthe sense of Telfer's talk, thought that all society had resolved itselfinto a few sturdy souls who went on and on regardless, and a hunger tomake of himself such another arose engulfing him. The desire within himseemed so compelling that he turned and haltingly tried to express whatwas in his mind.</p><p> "I will try," he stammered, "I will try to be a man. I will try to nothave anything to do with them--with women. I will work and make money-and--and----"</p><p> Speech left him. He rolled over and lying on his stomach looked at theground.</p><p> "To Hell with women and girls," he burst forth as though throwingsomething distasteful out of his throat.</p><p> In the road a clamour arose. The dogs, giving up the pursuit of rabbits,came barking and growling into sight and scampered up the grassy bank,covering the man and the boy. Shaking off the reaction upon his sensitivenature of the emotions of the boy Telfer arose. His _sang froid_ hadreturned to him. Cutting right and left with his stick at the dogs hecried joyfully, "We have had enough of eloquence from man, boy, and dog.We will be on our way. We will get this boy Sam home and tucked into bed."</p><h2>Book I - Chapter 5</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sam was a half-grown man of fifteen when the call of the city came to him.For six years he had been upon the streets. He had seen the sun come uphot and red over the corn fields, and had stumbled through the streets inthe bleak darkness of winter mornings, when the trains from the north cameinto Caxton covered with ice, and the trainmen stood on the desertedlittle platform whipping their arms and calling to Jerry Donlin to hurrywith his work that they might get back into the warm stale air of thesmoking car.</p><p> In the six years the boy had grown more and more determined to become aman of money. Fed by banker Walker, the silent mother, and in some subtleway by the very air he breathed, the belief within him that to make moneyand to have money would in some way make up for the old half-forgottenhumiliations in the life of the McPherson family and would set it on amore secure foundation than the wobbly Windy had provided, grew andinfluenced his thoughts and his acts. Tirelessly he kept at his efforts toget ahead. In his bed at night he dreamed of dollars. Jane McPherson hadherself a passion for frugality. In spite of Windy's incompetence and herown growing ill health, she would not permit the family to go into debt,and although, in the long hard winters, Sam sometimes ate cornmeal mushuntil his mind revolted at the thought of a corn field, yet was the rentof the little house paid on the scratch, and her boy fairly driven toincrease the totals in the yellow bankbook. Even Valmore, who since thedeath of his wife had lived in a loft above his shop and who was ablacksmith of the old days, a workman first and a money maker later, didnot despise the thought of gain.</p><p> "It is money makes the mare go," he said with a kind of reverence asbanker Walker, fat, sleek, and prosperous, walked pompously out ofWildman's grocery.</p><p> Of John Telfer's attitude toward money-making, the boy was uncertain. Theman followed with joyous abandonment the impulse of the moment.</p><p> "That's right," he cried impatiently when Sam, who had begun to expressopinions at the gatherings in the grocery, pointed out hesitatingly thatthe papers took account of men of wealth no matter what theirachievements, "Make money! Cheat! Lie! Be one of the men of the big world!Get your name up for a modern, high-class American!"</p><p> And in the next breath, turning upon Freedom Smith who had begun to beratethe boy for not sticking to the schools and who predicted that the daywould come when Sam would regret his lack of book learning, he shouted,"Let the schools go! They are but musty beds in which old clerkliness liesasleep!"</p><p> Among the travelling men who came to Caxton to sell goods, the boy, whohad continued the paper selling even after attaining the stature of a man,was a favourite. Sitting in chairs before the New Leland House they talkedto him of the city and of the money to be made there.</p><p> "It is the place for a live young man," they said.</p><p> Sam had a talent for drawing people into talk of themselves and of theiraffairs and began to cultivate travelling men. From them, he got into hisnostrils a whiff of the city and, listening to them, he saw the great waysfilled with hurrying people, the tall buildings touching the sky, the menrunning about intent upon money-making, and the clerks going on year afteryear on small salaries getting nowhere, a part of, and yet notunderstanding, the impulses and motives of the enterprises that supportedthem.</p><p> In this picture Sam thought he saw a place for himself. He conceived oflife in the city as a great game in which he believed he could play asterling part. Had he not in Caxton brought something out of nothing, hadhe not systematised and monopolised the selling of papers, had he notintroduced the vending of popcorn and peanuts from baskets to the Saturdaynight crowds? Already boys went out in his employ, already the totals inthe bank book had crept to more than seven hundred dollars. He felt withinhim a glow of pride at the thought of what he had done and would do.</p><p> "I will be richer than any man in town here," he declared in his pride. "Iwill be richer than Ed Walker."</p><p> Saturday night was the great night in Caxton life. For it the clerks inthe stores prepared, for it Sam sent forth his peanut and popcorn venders,for it Art Sherman rolled up his sleeves and put the glasses close by thebeer tap under the bar, and for it the mechanics, the farmers, and thelabourers dressed in their Sunday best and came forth to mingle with theirfellows. On Main Street crowds packed the stores, the sidewalks, anddrinking places, and men stood about in groups talking while young girlswith their lovers walked up and down. In the hall over Geiger's drug storea dance went on and the voice of the caller-off rose above the clatter ofvoices and the stamping of horses in the street. Now and then a fightbroke out among the roisterers in Piety Hollow. Once a young farm hand waskilled with a knife.</p><p> In and out through the crowd Sam went, pressing his wares.</p><p> "Remember the long quiet Sunday afternoon," he said, pushing a paper intothe hands of a slow-thinking farmer. "Recipes for cooking new dishes," heurged to the farmer's wife. "There is a page of new fashions in dress," hetold the young girl.</p><p> Not until the last light was out in the last saloon in Piety Hollow, andthe last roisterer had driven off into the darkness carrying a Saturdaypaper in his pocket, did Sam close the day's business.</p><p> And it was on a Saturday night that he decided to drop paper selling.</p><p> "I will take you into business with me," announced Freedom Smith, stoppinghim as he hurried by. "You are getting too old to sell papers and you knowtoo much."</p><p> Sam, still intent upon the money to be made on that particular Saturdaynight, did not stop to discuss the matter with Freedom, but for a year hehad been looking quietly about for something to go into and now he noddedhis head as he hurried away.</p><p> "It is the end of romance," shouted Telfer, who stood beside Freedom Smithbefore Geiger's drug store and who had heard the offer. "A boy, who hasseen the secret workings of my mind, who has heard me spout Poe andBrowning, will become a merchant, dealing in stinking hides. I am overcomeby the thought."</p><p> The next day, sitting in the garden back of his house, Telfer talked toSam of the matter at length.</p><p> "For you, my boy, I put the matter of money in the first place," hedeclared, leaning back in his chair, smoking a cigarette and from time totime tapping Eleanor on the shoulder with his cane. "For any boy I putmoney-making in the first place. It is only women and fools who despisemoney-making. Look at Eleanor here. The time and thought she puts into theselling of hats would be the death of me, but it has been the making ofher. See how fine and purposeful she has become. Without the millinerybusiness she would be a purposeless fool intent upon clothes and with itshe is all a woman should be. It is like a child to her."</p><p> Eleanor, who had turned to laugh at her husband, looked instead at theground and a shadow crossed her face. Telfer, who had begun talkingthoughtlessly, out of his excess of words, glanced from the woman to theboy. He knew that the suggestion regarding a child had touched a secretregret in Eleanor, and began trying to efface the shadow on her face bythrowing himself into the subject that chanced to be on his tongue, makingthe words roll and tumble from his lips.</p><p> "No matter what may come in the future, in our day money-making precedesmany virtues that are forever on men's lips," he declared fiercely asthough trying to down an opponent. "It is one of the virtues that provesman not a savage. It has lifted him up--not money-making, but the power tomake money. Money makes life livable. It gives freedom and destroys fear.Having it means sanitary houses and well-made clothes. It brings intomen's lives beauty and the love of beauty. It enables a man to goadventuring after the stuff of life as I have done.</p><p> "Writers are fond of telling stories of the crude excesses of greatwealth," he went on hurriedly, glancing again at Eleanor. "No doubt thethings they tell of do happen. Money, and not the ability and the instinctto make money, is at fault. And what of the cruder excesses of poverty,the drunken men who beat and starve their families, the grim silences ofthe crowded, unsanitary houses of the poor, the inefficient, and thedefeated? Go sit around the lounging room of the most vapid rich man'scity club as I have done, and then sit among the workers of a factory atthe noon hour. Virtue, you will find, is no fonder of poverty than you andI, and the man who has merely learned to be industrious, and who has notacquired that eager hunger and shrewdness that enables him to get on, maybuild up a strong dexterous body while his mind is diseased and decaying."</p><p> Grasping his cane and beginning to be carried away by the wind of hiseloquence Telfer forgot Eleanor and talked for his love of talking.</p><p> "The mind that has in it the love of the beautiful, that stuff that makesour poets, artists, musicians, and actors, needs this turn for shrewdmoney getting or it will destroy itself," he declared. "And the reallygreat artists have it. In books and stories the great men starve ingarrets. In real life they are more likely to ride in carriages on FifthAvenue and have country places on the Hudson. Go, see for yourself. Visitthe starving genius in his garret. It is a hundred to one that you willfind him not only incapable in money getting but also incapable in thevery art for which he starves."</p><p> After the hurried word from Freedom Smith, Sam began looking for a buyerfor the paper business. The place offered appealed to him and he wanted achance at it. In the buying of potatoes, butter, eggs, apples, and hideshe thought he could make money, also, he knew that the dogged persistencywith which he had kept at the putting of money in the bank had caughtFreedom's imagination, and he wanted to take advantage of the fact.</p><p> Within a few days the deal was made. Sam got three hundred and fiftydollars for the list of newspaper customers, the peanut and popcornbusiness and the transfer of the exclusive agencies he had arranged withthe dailies of Des Moines and St. Louis. Two boys bought the business,backed by their fathers. A talk in the back room of the bank, with thecashier telling of Sam's record as a depositor, and the seven hundreddollars surplus clinched the deal. When it came to the deal with Freedom,Sam took him into the back room at the bank and showed his savings as hehad shown them to the fathers of the two boys. Freedom was impressed. Hethought the boy would make money for him. Twice within a week Sam had seenthe silent suggestive power of cash.</p><p> The deal Sam made with Freedom included a fair weekly wage, enough to morethan take care of all his wants, and in addition he was to have two-thirdsof all he saved Freedom in the buying. Freedom on the other hand was tofurnish horse, vehicle, and keep for the horse, while Sam was to take careof the horse. The prices to be paid for the things bought were to be fixedeach morning by Freedom, and if Sam bought at less than the prices namedtwo-thirds of the savings went to him. The arrangement was suggested bySam, who thought he would make more from the saving than from the wage.</p><p> Freedom Smith discussed even the most trivial matter in a loud voice,roaring and shouting in the store and on the streets. He was a greatinventor of descriptive names, having a name of his own for every man,woman and child he knew and liked. "Old Maybe-Not" he called WindyMcPherson and would roar at him in the grocery asking him not to shedrebel blood in the sugar barrel. He drove about the country in a lowphaeton buggy that rattled and squeaked enormously and had a wide rip inthe top. To Sam's knowledge neither the buggy nor Freedom were washedduring his stay with the man. He had a method of his own in buying.Stopping in front of a farm house he would sit in his buggy and roar untilthe farmer came out of the field or the house to talk with him. And thenhaggling and shouting he would make his deal or drive on his way while thefarmer, leaning on the fence, laughed as at a wayward child.</p><p> Freedom lived in a large old brick house facing one of Caxton's beststreets. His house and yard were an eyesore to his neighbours who likedhim personally. He knew this and would stand on his front porch laughingand roaring about it. "Good morning, Mary," he would shout at the neatGerman woman across the street. "Wait and you'll see me clean up abouthere. I'm going at it right now. I'm going to brush the flies off thefence first."</p><p> Once he ran for a county office and got practically every vote in thecounty.</p><p> Freedom had a passion for buying up old half-worn buggies and agriculturalimplements, bringing them home to stand in the yard, gathering rust anddecay, and swearing they were as good as new. In the lot were a half dozenbuggies and a family carriage or two, a traction engine, a mowing machine,several farm wagons and other farm tools gone beyond naming. Every fewdays he came home bringing a new prize. They overflowed the yard and creptonto the porch. Sam never knew him to sell any of this stuff. He had atone time sixteen sets of harness all broken and unrepaired in the barn andin a shed back of the house. A great flock of chickens and two or threepigs wandered about among this junk and all the children of theneighbourhood joined Freedom's four and ran howling and shouting over andunder the mass.</p><p> Freedom's wife, a pale, silent woman, rarely came out of the house. Shehad a liking for the industrious, hard-working Sam and occasionally stoodat the back door and talked with him in a low, even voice at evening as hestood unhitching his horse after a day on the road. Both she and Freedomtreated him with great respect.</p><p> As a buyer Sam was even more successful than at the paper selling. He wasa buyer by instinct, working a wide stretch of country very systematicallyand within a year more than doubling the bulk of Freedom's purchases.</p><p> There is a little of Windy McPherson's grotesque pretentiousness in everyman and his son soon learned to look for and to take advantage of it. Helet men talk until they had exaggerated or overstated the value of theirgoods, then called them sharply to accounts, and before they had recoveredfrom their confusion drove home the bargain. In Sam's day, farmers did notwatch the daily market reports, in fact, the markets were not systematisedand regulated as they were later, and the skill of the buyer was of thefirst importance. Having the skill, Sam used it constantly to put moneyinto his pockets, but in some way kept the confidence and respect of themen with whom he traded.</p><p> The noisy, blustering Freedom was as proud as a father of the tradingability that developed in the boy and roared his name up and down thestreets and in the stores, declaring him the smartest boy in Iowa.</p><p> "Mighty little of old Maybe-Not in that boy," he would shout to theloafers in the store.</p><p> Although Sam had an almost painful desire for order and system in his ownaffairs, he did not try to bring these influences into Freedom's affairs,but kept his own records carefully and bought potatoes and apples, butterand eggs, furs and hides, with untiring zeal, working always to swell hiscommissions. Freedom took the risks in the business and many timesprofited little, but the two liked and respected each other and it wasthrough Freedom's efforts that Sam finally got out of Caxton and intolarger affairs.</p><p> One evening in the late fall Freedom came into the stable where Sam stoodtaking the harness off his horse.</p><p> "Here is a chance for you, my boy," he said, putting his handaffectionately on Sam's shoulder. There was a note of tenderness in hisvoice. He had written to the Chicago firm to whom he sold most of thethings he bought, telling of Sam and his ability, and the firm had repliedmaking an offer that Sam thought far beyond anything he might hope for inCaxton. In his hand he held this offer.</p><p> When Sam read the letter his heart jumped. He thought that it opened forhim a wide new field of effort and of money making. He thought that atlast he had come to the end of his boyhood and was to have his chance inthe city. Only that morning old Doctor Harkness had stopped him at thedoor as he set out for work and, pointing over his shoulder with his thumbto where in the house his mother lay, wasted and asleep, had told him thatin another week she would be gone, and Sam, heavy of heart and filled withuneasy longing, had walked through the streets to Freedom's stable wishingthat he also might be gone.</p><p> Now he walked across the stable floor and hung the harness he had takenfrom the horse upon a peg in the wall.</p><p> "I will be glad to go," he said heavily.</p><p> Freedom walked out of the stable door beside the young McPherson who hadcome to him as a boy and was now a broad-shouldered young man of eighteen.He did not want to lose Sam. He had written the Chicago company because ofhis affection for the boy and because he believed him capable of somethingmore than Caxton offered. Now he walked in silence holding the lanternaloft and guiding the way among the wreckage in the yard, filled withregrets.</p><p> By the back door of the house stood the pale, tired-looking wife who,putting out her hand, took the hand of the boy. There were tears in hereyes. And then saying nothing Sam turned and hurried off up the street,Freedom and his wife walked to the front gate and watched him go. From astreet corner, where he stopped in the shadow of a tree, Sam could seethem there, the wind swinging the lantern in Freedom's hand and theslender little old wife making a white blotch against the darkness.</p><h2>Book I - Chapter 6</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sam went along the board sidewalk homeward bound, hurried by the drivingMarch wind that had sent the lantern swinging in Freedom's hand. At thefront of a white frame residence a grey-haired old man stood leaning onthe gate and looking at the sky.</p><p> "We shall have a rain," he said in a quavering voice, as though giving adecision in the matter, and then turned and without waiting for an answerwent along a narrow path into the house.</p><p> The incident brought a smile to Sam's lips followed by a kind of wearinessof mind. Since the beginning of his work with Freedom he had, day afterday, come upon Henry Kimball standing by his gate and looking at the sky.The man was one of Sam's old newspaper customers who stood as a kind offigure in the town. It was said of him that in his youth he had been agambler on the Mississippi River and that he had taken part in more thanone wild adventure in the old days. After the Civil War he had come to endhis days in Caxton, living alone and occupying himself by keeping yearafter year a carefully tabulated record of weather variations. Once ortwice a month during the warm season he stumbled into Wildman's and,sitting by the stove, talked boastfully of the accuracy of his records andthe doings of a mangy dog that trotted at his heels. In his present moodthe endless sameness and uneventfulness of the man's life seemed to Samamusing and in some way sad.</p><p> "To depend upon going to the gate and looking at the sky to give point toa day--to look forward to and depend upon that--what deadliness!" hethought, and, thrusting his hand into his pocket, felt with pleasure theletter from the Chicago company that was to open so much of the bigoutside world to him.</p><p> In spite of the shock of unexpected sadness that had come with what hefelt was almost a definite parting with Freedom, and the sadness broughton by his mother's approaching death, Sam felt a strong thrill ofconfidence in his own future that made his homeward walk almost cheerful.The thrill got from reading the letter handed him by Freedom was renewedby the sight of old Henry Kimball at the gate, looking at the sky.</p><p> "I shall never be like that, sitting in a corner of the world watching amangy dog chase a ball and peering day after day at a thermometer," hethought.</p><p> The three years in Freedom Smith's service had taught Sam not to doubt hisability to cope with such business problems as might come in his way. Heknew that he had become what he wanted to be, a good business man, one ofthe men who direct and control the affairs in which they are concernedbecause of a quality in them called Business Sense. He recalled withpleasure the fact that the men of Caxton had stopped calling him a brightboy and now spoke of him as a good business man.</p><p> At the gate before his own house he stopped and stood thinking of thesethings and of the dying woman within. Back into his mind came the old manhe had seen at the gate and with him the thought that his mother's lifehad been as barren as that of the man who depended for companionship upona dog and a thermometer.</p><p> "Indeed," he said to himself, pursuing the thought, "it has been worse.She has not had a fortune on which to live in peace nor has she had theremembrance of youthful days of wild adventure that must comfort the lastdays of the old man. Instead she has been watching me as the old manwatches his thermometer and Father has been the dog in her house chasingplaythings." The figure pleased him. He stood at the gate, the windsinging in the trees along the street and driving an occasional drop ofrain against his cheek, and thought of it and of his life with his mother.During the last two or three years he had been trying to make things up toher. After the sale of the newspaper business and the beginning of hissuccess with Freedom he had driven her from the washtub and since thebeginning of her ill health he had spent evening after evening with herinstead of going to Wildman's to sit with the four friends and hear thetalk that went on among them. No more did he walk with Telfer or MaryUnderwood on country roads but sat, instead, by the bedside of the sickwoman or, the night falling fair, helped her to an arm chair upon thegrass plot at the front of the house.</p><p> The years, Sam felt, had been good years. They had brought him anunderstanding of his mother and had given a seriousness and purpose to theambitious plans he continued to make for himself. Alone together, themother and he had talked little, the habit of a lifetime making muchspeech impossible to her and the growing understanding of her making itunnecessary to him. Now in the darkness, before the house, he thought ofthe evenings he had spent with her and of the pitiful waste that had beenmade of her fine life. Things that had hurt him and against which he hadbeen bitter and unforgiving became of small import, even the doings of thepretentious Windy, who in the face of Jane's illness continued to go offafter pension day for long periods of drunkenness, and who only came hometo weep and wail through the house, when the pension money was gone,regretting, Sam tried in fairness to think, the loss of both the washwomanand the wife.</p><p> "She has been the most wonderful woman in the world," he told himself andtears of happiness came into his eyes at the thought of his friend, JohnTelfer, who in bygone days had praised the mother to the newsboy trottingbeside him on moonlit roads. Into his mind came a picture of her longgaunt face, ghastly now against the white of the pillows. A picture ofGeorge Eliot, tacked to the wall behind a broken harness in the kitchen ofFreedom Smith's house, had caught his eye some days before, and in thedarkness he took it from his pocket and put it to his lips, realising thatin some indescribable way it was like his mother as she had been beforeher illness. Freedom's wife had given him the picture and he had beencarrying it, taking it out of his pocket on lonely stretches of road as hewent about his work.</p><p> Sam went quietly around the house and stood by an old shed, a relic of anattempt by Windy to embark in raising chickens. He wanted to continue thethoughts of his mother. He began recalling her youth and the details of along talk they had held together on the lawn before the house. It wasextraordinarily vivid in his mind. He thought that even now he couldremember every word that had been said. The sick woman had talked of heryouth in Ohio, and as she talked pictures had come into the boy's mind.She had told him of her days as a bound girl in the family of a thinlipped, hard-fisted New Englander, who had come West to take a farm, andof her struggles to obtain an education, of the pennies saved to buybooks, of her joy when she had passed examinations and become a schoolteacher, and of her marriage to Windy--then John McPherson.</p><p> Into the Ohio village the young McPherson had come, to cut a figure in thetown's life. Sam had smiled at the picture she drew of the young man whowalked up and down the village street with girls on his arms, and whotaught a Bible class in the Sunday school.</p><p> When Windy proposed to the young school teacher she had accepted himeagerly, thinking it unbelievably romantic that so dashing a man shouldhave chosen so obscure a figure among all the women of the town.</p><p> "And even now I am not sorry although it has meant nothing but labour andunhappiness for me," the sick woman had told her son.</p><p> After marriage to the young dandy, Jane had come with him to Caxton wherehe bought a store and where, within three years, he had put the store intothe sheriff's hands and his wife into the position of town laundress.</p><p> In the darkness a grim smile, half scorn, half amusement, had flittedacross the face of the dying woman as she told of a winter when Windy andanother young fellow went, from schoolhouse to schoolhouse, over the stategiving a show. The ex-soldier had become a singer of comic songs and hadwritten letter after letter to the young wife telling of the applause thatgreeted his efforts. Sam could picture the performances, the little dimlylighted schoolhouses with the weatherbeaten faces shining in the light ofthe leaky magic lantern, and the delighted Windy running here and there,talking the jargon of stageland, arraying himself in his motley andstrutting upon the little stage.</p><p> "And all winter he did not send me a penny," the sick woman had said,interrupting his thoughts.</p><p> Aroused at last to expression, and filled with the memory of her youth,the silent woman had talked of her own people. Her father had been killedin the woods by a falling tree. Of her mother she told an anecdote,touching it briefly and with a grim humour that surprised her son.</p><p> The young school teacher had gone to call upon her mother once and for anhour had sat in the parlour of an Ohio farmhouse while a fierce old womanlooked at her with bold questioning eyes that made the daughter feel shehad been a fool to come.</p><p> At the railroad station she had heard an anecdote of her mother. The storyran, that once a burly tramp came to the farmhouse, and finding the womanalone tried to bully her, and that the tramp, and the woman, then in herprime, fought for an hour in the back yard of the house. The railroadagent, who told Jane the story, threw back his head and laughed.</p><p> "She knocked him out, too," he said, "knocked him cold upon the ground andthen filled him up with hard cider so that he came reeling into towndeclaring her the finest woman in the state."</p><p> In the darkness by the broken shed Sam's mind turned from thoughts of hismother to his sister Kate and of her love affair with the young farmer. Hethought with sadness of how she too had suffered because of the failingsof the father, of how she had been compelled to go out of the house towander in the dark streets to avoid the endless evenings of war talkalways brought on by a guest in the McPherson household, and of the nightwhen, getting a rig from Culvert's livery, she had driven off alone intothe country to return in triumph to pack her clothes and show her weddingring.</p><p> Before him there rose a picture of a summer afternoon when he had seen apart of the love making that had preceded this. He had gone into the storeto see his sister when the young farmer came in, looked awkwardly aboutand pushed a new gold watch across the counter to Kate. A sudden wave ofrespect for his sister had pervaded the boy. "What a sum it must havecost," he thought, and looked with new interest at the back of the loverand at the flushed cheek and shining eyes of his sister. When the lover,turning, had seen young McPherson standing at the counter, he laughedself-consciously and walked out at the door. Kate had been embarrassed andsecretly pleased and flattered by the look in her brother's eyes, but hadpretended to treat the gift lightly, twirling it carelessly back and forthon the counter and walking up and down swinging her arms.</p><p> "Don't go telling," she had said.</p><p> "Then don't go pretending," the boy had answered.</p><p> Sam thought that his sister's indiscretion, which had brought her a babeand a husband in the same month had, after all, ended better than theindiscretion of his mother in her marriage with Windy.</p><p> Rousing himself, he went into the house. A neighbour woman, employed forthe purpose, had prepared the evening meal and now began complaining ofhis lateness, saying that the food had got cold.</p><p> Sam ate in silence. While he ate the woman went out of the house andpresently returned, bringing a daughter.</p><p> There was in Caxton a code that would not allow a woman to be alone in ahouse with a man. Sam wondered if the bringing of the daughter was anattempt on the part of the woman to abide by the letter of the code, ifshe thought of the sick woman in the house as one already gone. Thethought amused and saddened him.</p><p> "You would have thought her safe," he mused. She was fifty, small, nervousand worn and wore a set of ill-fitting false teeth that rattled as shetalked. When she did not talk she rattled them with her tongue because ofnervousness.</p><p> In at the kitchen door came Windy, far gone in drink. He stood by the doorholding to the knob with his hand and trying to get control of himself.</p><p> "My wife--my wife is dying. She may die any day," he wailed, tearsstanding in his eyes.</p><p> The woman with the daughter went into the little parlour where a bed hadbeen put for the sick woman. Sam sat at the kitchen table dumb with angerand disgust as Windy, lurching forward, fell into a chair and begansobbing loudly. In the road outside a man driving a horse stopped and Samcould hear the scraping of the wheels against the buggy body as the manturned in the narrow street. Above the scraping of the wheels rose avoice, swearing profanely. The wind continued to blow and it had begun torain.</p><p> "He has got into the wrong street," thought the boy stupidly.</p><p> Windy, his head upon his hands, wept like a brokenhearted boy, his sobsechoing through the house, his breath heavy with liquor tainting the airof the room. In a corner by the stove the mother's ironing board stoodagainst the wall and the sight of it added fuel to the anger smoulderingin Sam's heart. He remembered the day when he had stood in the storedoorway with his mother and had seen the dismal and amusing failure of hisfather with the bugle, and of the months before Kate's wedding, when Windyhad gone blustering about town threatening to kill her lover and themother and boy had stayed with the girl, out of sight in the house, sickwith humiliation.</p><p> The drunken man, laying his head upon the table, fell asleep, his snoresreplacing the sobs that had stirred the boy's anger. Sam began thinkingagain of his mother's life.</p><p> The effort he had made to repay her for the hardness of her life nowseemed utterly fruitless. "I would like to repay him," he thought, shakenwith a sudden spasm of hatred as he looked at the man before him. Thecheerless little kitchen, the cold, half-baked potatoes and sausages onthe table, and the drunken man asleep, seemed to him a kind of symbol ofthe life that had been lived in that house, and with a shudder he turnedhis face and stared at the wall.</p><p> He thought of a dinner he had once eaten at Freedom Smith's house. Freedomhad brought the invitation into the stables on that night just as to-nighthe had brought the letter from the Chicago company, and just as Sam wasshaking his head in refusal of the invitation in at the stable door hadcome the children. Led by the eldest, a great tomboy girl of fourteen withthe strength of a man and an inclination to burst out of her clothes atunexpected places, they had come charging into the stables to carry Samoff to the dinner, Freedom laughingly urging them on, his voice roaring inthe stable so that the horses jumped about in their stalls. Into the housethey had dragged him, the baby, a boy of four, sitting astride his backand beating on his head with a woollen cap, and Freedom swinging a lanternand giving an occasional helpful push with his hand.</p><p> A picture of the long table covered with the white cloth at the end of thebig dining room in Freedom's house came back into the mind of the boy nowsitting in the barren little kitchen before the untasted, badly-cookedfood. Upon it lay a profusion of bread and meat and great dishes heapedwith steaming potatoes. At his own house there had always been just enoughfood for the single meal. The thing was nicely calculated, when you hadfinished the table was bare.</p><p> How he had enjoyed that dinner after the long day on the road. With aflourish and a roar at the children Freedom heaped high the plates andpassed them about, the wife or the tomboy girl bringing unending freshsupplies from the kitchen. The joy of the evening with its talk of thechildren in school, its sudden revelation of the womanliness of the tomboygirl, and its air of plenty and good living haunted the mind of the boy.</p><p> "My mother never knew anything like that," he thought.</p><p> The drunken man who had been sleeping aroused himself and began talkingloudly--some old forgotten grievance coming back to his mind, he talked ofthe cost of school books.</p><p> "They change the books in the school too often," he declared in a loudvoice, turning and facing the kitchen stove, as though addressing anaudience. "It is a scheme to graft on old soldiers who have children. Iwill not stand it."</p><p> Sam, enraged beyond speech, tore a leaf from a notebook and scrawled amessage upon it.</p><p> "Be silent," he wrote. "If you say another word or make another sound todisturb mother I will choke you and throw you like a dead dog into thestreet."</p><p> Reaching across the table and touching his father on the hand with a forktaken from among the dishes, he laid the note upon the table under thelamp before his eyes. He was fighting with himself to control a desire tospring across the room and kill the man who he believed had brought hismother to her death and who now sat bellowing and talking at her verydeath bed. The desire distorted his mind so that he stared about thekitchen like one seized with an insane nightmare.</p><p> Windy, taking the note in his hand, read it slowly and then, notunderstanding its import and but half getting its sense, put it in hispocket.</p><p> "A dog is dead, eh?" he shouted. "Well you're getting too big and smart,lad. What do I care for a dead dog?"</p><p> Sam did not answer. Rising cautiously, he crept around the table and puthis hand upon the throat of the babbling old man.</p><p> "I must not kill," he kept telling himself aloud, as though talking to astranger. "I must choke until he is silent, but I must not kill."</p><p> In the kitchen the two men struggled silently. Windy, unable to rise,struck out wildly and helplessly with his feet. Sam, looking down at himand studying the eyes and the colour in the cheeks, realised with a startthat he had not for years seen the face of his father. How vividly itstamped itself upon his mind now, and how coarse and sodden it had become.</p><p> "I could repay all of the years mother has spent over the dreary washtubby just one long, hard grip at this lean throat. I could kill him with solittle extra pressure," he thought.</p><p> The eyes began to stare at him and the tongue to protrude. Across theforehead ran a streak of mud picked up somewhere in the long afternoon ofdrunken carousing.</p><p> "If I were to press hard now and kill him I would see his face as it looksnow all the days of my life," thought the boy.</p><p> In the silence of the house he heard the voice of the neighbour womanspeaking sharply to her daughter. The familiar, dry, tired cough of thesick woman followed. Sam took the unconscious old man in his arms and wentcarefully and silently out at the kitchen door. The rain beat down uponhim and, as he went around the house with his burden, the wind, shakingloose a dead branch from a small apple tree in the yard, blew it againsthis face, leaving a long smarting scratch. At the fence before the househe stopped and threw his burden down a short grassy bank into the road.Then turning he went, bareheaded, through the gate and up the street.</p><p> "I will go for Mary Underwood," he thought, his mind returning to thefriend who years before had walked with him on country roads and whosefriendship he had dropped because of John Telfer's tirades against allwomen. He stumbled along the sidewalk, the rain beating down upon his barehead.</p><p> "We need a woman in our house," he kept saying over and over to himself."We need a woman in our house."</p><h2>Book I - Chapter 7</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> Leaning against the wall under the veranda of Mary Underwood's house, Samtried to get in his mind a remembrance of what had brought him there. Hehad walked bareheaded through Main Street and out along a country road.Twice he had fallen, covering his clothes with mud. He had forgotten thepurpose of his walk and had tramped on and on. The unexpected and terriblehatred of his father that had come upon him in the tense silence of thekitchen had so paralysed his brain that he now felt light-headed andwonderfully happy and carefree.</p><p> "I have been doing something," he thought; "I wonder what it is."</p><p> The house faced a grove of pine trees and was reached by climbing a littlerise and following a winding road out beyond the graveyard and the last ofthe village lights. The wild spring rain pounded and rattled on the tinroof overhead, and Sam, his back closely pressed against the front of thehouse, fought to regain control of his mind.</p><p> For an hour he stood there staring into the darkness and watched withdelight the progress of the storm. He had--an inheritance from his mother--a love of thunderstorms. He remembered a night when he was a boy and hismother had got out of bed and gone here and there through the housesinging. She had sung softly so that the sleeping father did not hear, andin his bed upstairs Sam had lain awake listening to the noises--the rainon the roof, the occasional crash of thunder, the snoring of Windy, andthe unusual and, he thought, beautiful sound of the mother singing in thestorm.</p><p> Now, lifting up his head, he looked about with delight. Trees in the grovein front of him bent and tossed in the wind. The inky blackness of thenight was relieved by the flickering oil lamp in the road beyond thegraveyard and, in the distance, by the lights streaming out at the windowsof the houses. The light coming out of the house against which he stoodmade a little cylinder of brightness among the pine trees through whichthe raindrops fell gleaming and sparkling. An occasional flash oflightning lit up the trees and the winding road, and the cannonry of theskies rolled and echoed overhead. A kind of wild song sang in Sam's heart.</p><p> "I wish it would last all night," he thought, his mind fixed on thesinging of his mother in the dark house when he was a boy.</p><p> The door opened and a woman stepped out upon the veranda and stood beforehim facing the storm, the wind tossing the soft kimono in which she wasclad and the rain wetting her face. Under the tin roof, the air was filledwith the rattling reverberation of the rain. The woman lifted her headand, with the rain beating down upon her, began singing, her finecontralto voice rising above the rattle of the rain on the roof and goingon uninterrupted by the crash of the thunder. She sang of a lover ridingthrough the storm to his mistress. One refrain persisted in the song--</p><p> "He rode and he thought of her red, red lips,"</p><p> sang the woman, putting her hand upon the railing of the little porch andleaning forward into the storm.</p><p> Sam was amazed. The woman standing before him was Mary Underwood, who hadbeen his friend when he was a boy in school and toward whom his mind hadturned after the tragedy in the kitchen. The figure of the woman standingsinging before him became a part of his thoughts of his mother singing onthe stormy night in the house and his mind wandered on, seeing pictures ashe used to see them when a boy walking under the stars and listening tothe talk of John Telfer. He saw a broad-shouldered man shouting defianceto the storm as he rode down a mountain path.</p><p> "And he laughed at the rain on his wet, wet cloak," went on the voice ofthe singer.</p><p> Mary Underwood's singing there in the rain made her seem near and likeableas she had seemed to him when he was a barefoot boy.</p><p> "John Telfer was wrong about her," he thought.</p><p> She turned and faced him. Tiny streams of water ran from her hair downacross her cheeks. A flash of lightning cut the darkness, illuminating thespot where Sam, now a broad-shouldered man, stood with the mud upon hisclothes and the bewildered look upon his face. A sharp exclamation ofsurprise broke from her lips:</p><p> "Hello, Sam! What are you doing here? You had better get in out of therain."</p><p> "I like it here," replied Sam, lifting his head and looking past her atthe storm.</p><p> Walking to the door and standing with her hand upon the knob, Mary lookedinto the darkness.</p><p> "You have been a long time coming to see me," she said, "come in."</p><p> Within the house, with the door closed, the rattle of the rain on theveranda roof sank to a subdued, quiet drumming. Piles of books lay upon atable in the centre of the room and there were other books on the shelvesalong the walls. On a table burned a student's lamp and in the corners ofthe room lay heavy shadows.</p><p> Sam stood by the wall near the door looking about with half-seeing eyes.</p><p> Mary, who had gone to another part of the house and who now returned cladin a long cloak, looked at him with quick curiosity, and began movingabout the room picking up odds and ends of woman's clothing scattered onthe chairs. Kneeling, she lighted a fire under some sticks piled in anopen grate at the side of the room.</p><p> "It was the storm made me want to sing," she said self-consciously, andthen briskly, "we shall have to be drying you out; you have fallen in theroad and got yourself covered with mud."</p><p> From being morose and silent Sam became talkative. An idea had come intohis mind.</p><p> "I have come here courting," he thought; "I have come to ask MaryUnderwood to be my wife and live in my house."</p><p> The woman, kneeling by the blazing sticks, made a picture that arousedsomething that had been sleeping in him. The heavy cloak she wore, fallingaway, showed the round little shoulders imperfectly covered by the kimono,wet and clinging to them. The slender, youthful figure, the soft grey hairand the serious little face, lit by the burning sticks caused a jumping ofhis heart.</p><p> "We are needing a woman in our house," he said heavily, repeating thewords that had been on his lips as he stumbled through the storm-sweptstreets and along the mud-covered roads. "We are needing a woman in ourhouse, and I have come to take you there.</p><p> "I intend to marry you," he added, lurching across the room and graspingher roughly by the shoulders. "Why not? I am needing a woman."</p><p> Mary Underwood was dismayed and frightened by the face looking down ather, and by the strong hands clenched upon her shoulders. In his youth shehad conceived a kind of maternal passion for the newsboy and had planned afuture for him. Her plans if followed would have made him a scholar, a manliving his life among books and ideas. Instead, he had chosen to live hislife among men, to be a money-maker, to drive about the country likeFreedom Smith, making deals with farmers. She had seen him driving atevening through the street to Freedom's house, going in and out ofWildman's, and walking through the streets with men. In a dim way she knewthat an influence had been at work upon him to win him from the things ofwhich she had dreamed and she had secretly blamed John Telfer, thetalking, laughing idler. Now, out of the storm, the boy had come back toher, his hands and his clothes covered with the mud of the road, andtalked to her, a woman old enough to be his mother, of marriage and ofcoming to live with him in his house. She stood, chilled, looking into theeager, strong face and the eyes with the pained, dazed look in them.</p><p> Under her gaze, something of the old feeling of the boy came back to Sam,and he began vaguely trying to tell her of it.</p><p> "It was not the talk of Telfer drove me from you," he began, "it wasbecause you talked so much of the schools and of books. I was tired ofthem. I could not go on year after year sitting in a stuffy littleschoolroom when there was so much money to be made in the world. I grewtired of the school teachers, drumming with their fingers on the desks andlooking out at the windows at men passing in the street. I wanted to getout of there and into the streets myself."</p><p> Dropping his hands from her shoulders, he sat down in a chair and staredinto the fire, now blazing steadily. Steam began to rise from his trouserslegs. His mind, still working beyond his control, began to reconstruct anold boyhood fancy, half his own, half John Telfer's, that had years beforecome into his mind. It concerned a picture he and Telfer had made of theideal scholar. The picture had, as its central figure, a stoop-shouldered,feeble old man stumbling along the street, muttering to himself and pokingin a gutter with a stick. The picture was a caricature of puttering oldFrank Huntley, superintendent of the Caxton schools.</p><p> Sitting before the fire in Mary Underwood's house, become, for the moment,a boy, facing a boy's problems, Sam did not want to be such a man. Hewanted only that in scholarship which would help him to be the kind of manhe was bent on being, a man of the world doing the work of the world andmaking money by his work. Things he had been unable to get expressed whenhe was a boy and her friend, coming again into his mind, he felt that hemust here and now make it plain to Mary Underwood that the schools werenot giving him what he wanted. His brain worked on the problem of how totell her about it.</p><p> Turning, he looked at her and said earnestly: "I am going to quit theschools. It is not your fault, but I am going to quit just the same."</p><p> Mary, who had been looking down at the great mud-covered figure in thechair began to understand. A light came into her eyes. Going to the dooropening into a stairway leading to sleeping rooms above, she calledsharply, "Auntie, come down here at once. There is a sick man here."</p><p> A startled, trembling voice answered from above, "Who is it?"</p><p> Mary Underwood did not answer. She came back to Sam and, putting her handgently on his shoulder, said, "It is your mother and you are only a sick,half-crazed boy after all. Is she dead? Tell me about it."</p><p> Sam shook his head. "She is still there in the bed, coughing." He rousedhimself and stood up. "I have just killed my father," he announced. "Ichoked him and threw him down the bank into the road in front of thehouse. He made horrible noises in the kitchen and mother was tired andwanted to sleep."</p><p> Mary Underwood began running about the room. From a little alcove under astairway she took clothes, throwing them upon the floor about the room.She pulled on a stocking and, unconscious of Sam's presence, raised herskirts and fastened it. Then, putting one shoe on the stockinged foot andthe other on the bare one, she turned to him. "We will go back to yourhouse. I think you are right. You need a woman there."</p><p> In the street she walked rapidly along, clinging to the arm of the tallfellow who strode silently beside her. A cheerfulness had come over Sam.He felt he had accomplished something--something he had set out toaccomplish. He again thought of his mother and drifting into the notionthat he was on his way home from work at Freedom Smith's, began planningthe evening he would spend with her.</p><p> "I will tell her of the letter from the Chicago company and of what I willdo when I go to the city," he thought.</p><p> At the gate before the McPherson house Mary looked into the road below thegrassy bank that ran down from the fence, but in the darkness she couldsee nothing. The rain continued to fall and the wind screamed and shoutedas it rushed through the bare branches of the trees. Sam went through thegate and around the house to the kitchen door intent upon getting to hismother's bedside.</p><p> In the house the neighbour woman sat asleep in a chair before the kitchenstove. The daughter had gone.</p><p> Sam went through the house to the parlour and sat down in a chair besidehis mother's bed, picking up her hand and holding it in his own. "She mustbe asleep," he thought.</p><p> At the kitchen door Mary Underwood stopped, and, turning, ran away intothe darkness along the street. By the kitchen fire the neighbour womanstill slept. In the parlour Sam, sitting on the chair beside his mother'sbed, looked about him. A lamp burned dimly upon the little stand besidethe bed and the light of it fell upon the portrait of a tall,aristocratic-looking woman with rings on her fingers, that hung upon thewall. The picture belonged to Windy and was claimed by him as a portraitof his mother, and it had once brought on a quarrel between Sam and hissister.</p><p> Kate had taken the portrait of the lady seriously, and the boy had comeupon her sitting in a chair before it, her hair rearranged and her handslying in her lap in imitation of the pose maintained so haughtily by thegreat lady who looked down at her.</p><p> "It is a fraud," he had declared, irritated by what he believed hissister's devotion to one of the father's pretensions. "It is a fraud hehas picked up somewhere and now claims as his mother to make peoplebelieve he is something big."</p><p> The girl, ashamed at having been caught in the pose, and furious becauseof the attack upon the authenticity of the portrait, had gone into a spasmof indignation, putting her hands to her ears and stamping on the floorwith her foot. Then she had run across the room and dropped upon her kneesbefore a little couch, buried her face in a pillow and shook with angerand grief.</p><p> Sam had turned and walked out of the room. The emotions of the sister hadseemed to him to have the flavour of one of Windy's outbreaks.</p><p> "She likes it," he had thought, dismissing the incident. "She likesbelieving in lies. She is like Windy and would rather believe in them thannot."</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> Mary Underwood ran through the rain to John Telfer's house and beat on thedoor with her fist until Telfer, followed by Eleanor, holding a lamp aboveher head, appeared at the door. With Telfer she went back through thestreets to the front of Sam's house thinking of the terrible choked anddisfigured man they should find there. She went along clinging to Telfer'sarm as she had clung to Sam's, unconscious of her bare head and scantyattire. In his hand Telfer carried a lantern secured from the stable.</p><p> In the road before the house they found nothing. Telfer went up and downswinging the lantern and peering into gutters. The woman walked besidehim, her skirts lifted and the mud splashing upon her bare leg.</p><p> Suddenly Telfer threw back his head and laughed. Taking her hand he ledMary with a rush up the bank and through the gate.</p><p> "What a muddle-headed old fool I am!" he cried. "I am getting old andaddle-pated! Windy McPherson is not dead! Nothing could kill that old warhorse! He was in at Wildman's grocery after nine o'clock to-night coveredwith mud and swearing he had been in a fight with Art Sherman. Poor Samand you--to have come to me and to have found me a stupid ass! Fool! Fool!What a fool I have become!"</p><p> In at the kitchen door ran Mary and Telfer, frightening the woman by thestove so that she sprang to her feet and began nervously making the falseteeth rattle with her tongue. In the parlour they found Sam, his head uponthe edge of the bed, asleep. In his hand he held the cold hand of JaneMcPherson. She had been dead for an hour. Mary Underwood stooped over andkissed his wet hair as the neighbour woman came in at the doorway bearingthe kitchen lamp, and John Telfer, holding his finger to his lips,commanded silence.</p><h2>Book I - Chapter 8</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> The funeral of Jane McPherson was a trying affair for her son. He thoughtthat his sister Kate, with the babe in her arms, had become coarsened--shelooked frumpish and, while they were in the house, had an air of havingquarrelled with her husband when they came out of their bedroom in themorning. During the funeral service Sam sat in the parlour, astonished andirritated by the endless number of women that crowded into the house. Theywere everywhere, in the kitchen, the sleeping room back of the parlour;and in the parlour, where the dead woman lay in her coffin, they weremassed. When the thin-lipped minister, holding a book in his hand, heldforth upon the virtues of the dead woman, they wept. Sam looked at thefloor and thought that thus they would have wept over the body of the deadWindy, had his fingers but tightened a trifle. He wondered if the ministerwould have talked in the same way--blatantly and without knowledge--of thevirtues of the dead. In a chair at the side of the coffin the bereavedhusband, in new black clothes, wept audibly. The baldheaded, officiousundertaker kept moving nervously about, intent upon the ritual of histrade.</p><p> During the service, a man sitting behind him dropped a note on the floorat Sam's feet. Sam picked it up and read it, glad of something to distracthis attention from the voice of the minister, and the faces of the weepingwomen, none of whom had before been in the house and all of whom hethought strikingly lacking in a sense of the sacredness of privacy. Thenote was from John Telfer.</p><p> "I will not come to your mother's funeral," he wrote. "I respected yourmother while she lived and I will leave you alone with her now that she isdead. In her memory I will hold a ceremony in my heart. If I am inWildman's, I may ask the man to quit selling soap and tobacco for themoment and to close and lock the door. If I am at Valmore's shop, I willgo up into his loft and listen to him pounding on the anvil below. If heor Freedom Smith go to your house, I warn them I will cut theirfriendship. When I see the carriages going through the street and knowthat the thing is right well done and over, I will buy flowers and takethem to Mary Underwood as an appreciation of the living in the name of thedead."</p><p> The note cheered and comforted Sam. It gave him back a grip of somethingthat had slipped from him.</p><p> "It is good sense, after all," he thought, and realised that even in thedays when he was being made to suffer horrors, and in the face of the factthat Jane McPherson's long, hard role was just being played out to theend, the farmer in the field was sowing his corn, Valmore was beating uponhis anvil, and John Telfer was writing notes with a flourish. He arose,interrupting the minister's discourse. Mary Underwood had come in just asthe minister began talking and had dropped into an obscure corner near thedoor leading into the street. Sam crowded past the women who stared andthe minister who frowned and the baldheaded undertaker who wrung his handsand, dropping the note into her lap, said, oblivious of the people lookingand listening with breathless curiosity, "It is from John Telfer. Read it.Even he, hating women as he did, is now bringing flowers to your door."</p><p> In the room a wind of whispered comments sprang up. Women, putting theirheads together and their hands before their faces, nodded toward theschool teacher, and the boy, unconscious of the sensation he had created,went back to his chair and looked again at the floor, waiting until thetalk and the singing of songs and the parading through the streets shouldbe ended. Again the minister began reading from the book.</p><p> "I have become older than all of these people here," thought the youth."They play at life and death, and I have felt it between the fingers of myhand."</p><p> Mary Underwood, lacking Sam's unconsciousness of the people, looked aboutwith burning cheeks. Seeing the women whispering and putting their headstogether, a chill of fear ran through her. Into the room had been thrustthe face of an old enemy to her--the scandal of a small town. Picking upthe note she slipped out at the door and stole away along the street. Theold maternal love for Sam had returned strengthened and ennobled by theterror through which she had passed with him that night in the rain. Goingto her house she whistled the collie dog and set out along a country road.At the edge of a grove of trees she stopped, sat down on a log, and readTelfer's note. From the soft ground into which her feet sank there camethe warm pungent smell of the new growth. Tears came into her eyes. Shethought that in a few days much had come to her. She had got a boy uponwhom she could pour out the mother love in her heart, and she had made afriend of Telfer, whom she had long regarded with fear and doubt.</p><p> For a month Sam lingered in Caxton. It seemed to him there was somethingthat wanted doing there. He sat with the men at the back of Wildman's, andwalked aimlessly through the streets and out of the town along the countryroads, where men worked all day in the fields behind sweating horses,ploughing the land. The thrill of spring was in the air, and in theevening a song sparrow sang in the apple tree below his bedroom window.Sam walked and loitered in silence, looking at the ground. In his mind wasthe dread of people. The talk of the men in the store wearied him and whenhe went alone into the country he found himself accompanied by the voicesof all of those he had come out of town to escape. On the street cornerthe thin-lipped, brown-bearded minister stopped him and talked of thefuture life as he had stopped and talked to a bare-legged newsboy.</p><p> "Your mother," he said, "has but gone before. It is for you to get intothe narrow path and follow her. God has sent this sorrow as a warning toyou. He wants you also to get into the way of life and in the end to joinher. Begin coming to our church. Join in the work of the Christ. Findtruth."</p><p> Sam, who had listened without hearing, shook his head and went on. Theminister's talk seemed no more than a meaningless jumble of words out ofwhich he got but one thought.</p><p> "Find truth," he repeated to himself after the minister, and let his mindplay with the idea. "The best men are all trying to do that. They spendtheir lives at the task. They are all trying to find truth."</p><p> He went along the street, pleased with himself because of theinterpretation he had put upon the minister's words. The terrible momentsin the kitchen followed by his mother's death had put a new look ofseriousness into his face and he felt within him a new sense ofresponsibility to the dead woman and to himself. Men stopped him on thestreet and wished him well in the city. News of his leaving had becomepublic. Things in which Freedom Smith was concerned were always publicaffairs.</p><p> "He would take a drum with him to make love to a neighbour's wife," saidJohn Telfer.</p><p> Sam felt that in a way he was a child of Caxton. Early it had taken him toits bosom; it had made of him a semi-public character; it had encouragedhim in his money-making, humiliated him through his father, and patronisedhim lovingly because of his toiling mother. When he was a boy, scurryingbetween the legs of the drunkards in Piety Hollow of a Saturday night,there was always some one to speak a word to him of his morals and toshout at him a cheering word of advice. Had he elected to remain there,with the thirty-five hundred dollars already in the Savings Bank--built tothat during his years with Freedom Smith--he might soon become one of thetown's solid men.</p><p> He did not want to stay. He felt that his call was in another place andthat he would go there gladly. He wondered why he did not get on the trainand be off.</p><p> One night when he had been late on the road, loitering by fences, hearingthe lonely barking of dogs at distant farmhouses, getting the smell of thenew-ploughed ground into his nostrils, he came into town and sat down on alow iron fence that ran along by the platform of the railroad station, towait for the midnight train north. Trains had taken on a new meaning tohim since any day might see him on such a train bound into his new life.</p><p> A man, with two bags in his hands, came on the station platform followedby two women.</p><p> "Here, watch these," he said to the women, setting the bags upon theplatform; "I will go for the tickets," and disappeared into the darkness.</p><p> The two women resumed their interrupted talk.</p><p> "Ed's wife has been poorly these ten years," said one of them. "It will bebetter for her and for Ed now that she is dead, but I dread the long ride.I wish she had died when I was in Ohio two years ago. I am sure to betrain-sick."</p><p> Sam, sitting in the darkness, was thinking of a part of one of JohnTelfer's old talks with him.</p><p> "They are good people but they are not your people. You will go away fromhere. You will be a big man of dollars, it is plain."</p><p> He began listening idly to the two women. The man had a shop for mendingshoes on a side street back of Geiger's drug store and the two women, oneshort and round, one long and thin, kept a small, dingy millinery shop andwere Eleanor Telfer's only competitors.</p><p> "Well, the town knows her now for what she is," said the tall woman."Milly Peters says she won't rest until she has put that stuck-up MaryUnderwood in her place. Her mother worked in the McPherson house and itwas her told Milly. I never heard such a story. To think of Jane McPhersonworking all these years and then having such goings-on in her house whenshe lay dying, Milly says that Sam went away early in the evening and camehome late with that Underwood thing, half dressed, hanging on his arm.Milly's mother looked out of the window and saw them. Then she ran out bythe kitchen stove and pretended to be asleep. She wanted to see what wasup. And the bold hussy came right into the house with Sam. Then she wentaway, and after a while back she came with that John Telfer. Milly isgoing to see that Eleanor Telfer finds it out. I guess it will bring herdown, too. And there is no telling how many other men in this town MaryUnderwood is running with. Milly says----"</p><p> The two women turned as out of the darkness came a tall figure roaring andswearing. Two hands flashed out and sank into their hair.</p><p> "Stop it!" growled Sam, beating the two heads together, "stop your dirtylies!--you ugly she-beasts!"</p><p> Hearing the two women screaming the man who had gone for the railroadtickets came running down the station platform followed by Jerry Donlin.Springing forward Sam knocked the shoemaker over the iron fence into anewly spaded flower bed and then turned to the baggage man.</p><p> "They were telling lies about Mary Underwood," he shouted. "She tried tosave me from killing my father and now they are telling lies about her."</p><p> The two women picked up the bags and ran whimpering away along the stationplatform. Jerry Donlin climbed over the iron fence and confronted thesurprised and frightened shoemaker.</p><p> "What the Hell are you doing in my flower bed?" he growled.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> Hurrying through the streets Sam's mind was in a ferment. Like the Romanemperor he wished that all the world had but one head that he might cut itoff with a slash. The town that had seemed so paternal, so cheery, sointent upon wishing him well, now seemed horrible. He thought of it as agreat, crawling, slimy thing lying in wait amid the cornfields.</p><p> "To be saying that of her, of that white soul!" he exclaimed aloud in theempty street, all of his boyish loyalty and devotion to the woman who hadput out a hand to him in his hour of trouble aroused and burning in him.</p><p> He wished that he might meet another man and could hit him also a swingingblow on the nose as he had hit the amazed shoemaker. He went to his ownhouse and, leaning on the gate, stood looking at it and swearingmeaninglessly. Then, turning, he went again through the deserted streetspast the railroad station where, the midnight train having come and goneand Jerry Donlin having gone home for the night, all was dark and quiet.He was filled with horror of what Mary Underwood had seen at JaneMcPherson's funeral.</p><p> "It is better to be utterly bad than to speak ill of another," he thought.</p><p> For the first time he realised another side of village life. In fancy hesaw going past him on the dark road a long file of women, women withcoarse unlighted faces and dead eyes. Many of the faces he knew. They werethe faces of Caxton wives at whose houses he had delivered papers. Heremembered how eagerly they had run out of their houses to get the papersand how they hung day after day over the details of sensational murdercases. Once, when a Chicago girl had been murdered in a dive and thedetails were unusually revolting, two women, unable to restrain theircuriosity, had come to the station to wait for the train bringing thenewspapers and Sam had heard them rolling the horrid mess over and over ontheir tongues.</p><p> In every city and in every village there is a class of women, the thoughtof whom paralyses the mind. They live their lives in small, unaired,unsanitary houses, and go on year after year washing dishes and clothes-only their fingers occupied. They read no good books, think no cleanthoughts, are made love to as John Telfer had said, with kisses in adarkened room by a shame-faced yokel and, after marrying some such ayokel, live lives of unspeakable blankness. Into the houses of these womencome the husbands at evening, tired and uncommunicative, to eat hurriedlyand then go again into the streets or, the blessing of utter physicalexhaustion having come to them, to sit for an hour in stockinged feetbefore crawling away to sleep and oblivion.</p><p> In these women is no light, no vision. They have instead certain fixedideas to which they cling with a persistency touching heroism. To the manthey have snatched from society they cling also with a tenacity to bemeasured only by their love of a roof over their heads and the craving forfood to put into their stomachs. Being mothers, they are the despair ofreformers, the shadow on the vision of dreamers and they put the blackdread upon the heart of the poet who cries, "The female of the species ismore deadly than the male." At their worst they are to be seen drunk withemotion amid the lurid horrors of a French Revolution or immersed in thesecret whispering, creeping terror of a religious persecution. At theirbest they are mothers of half mankind. Wealth coming to them, they throwthemselves into garish display of it and flash upon the sight of Newportor Palm Beach. In their native lair in the close little houses, they sleepin the bed of the man who has put clothes upon their backs and food intotheir mouths because that is the usage of their kind and give him of theirbodies grudgingly or willingly as the laws of their physical needs direct.They do not love, they sell, instead, their bodies in the market place andcry out that man shall witness their virtue because they had had the joyof finding one buyer instead of the many of the red sisterhood. A fierceanimalism in them makes them cling to the babe at their breast and in thedays of its softness and loveliness they close their eyes and try to catchagain an old fleeting dream of their girlhood, a something vague, shadowy,no longer a part of them, brought with the babe out of the infinite.Having passed beyond the land of dreams, they dwell in the land ofemotions and weep over the bodies of unknown dead or sit under theeloquence of evangelists, shouting of heaven and of hell--the call to theone being brother to the call of the other--crying upon the troubled airof hot little churches, where hope is fighting in the jaws of vulgarity,"The weight of my sins is heavy on my soul." Along streets they go liftingheavy eyes to peer into the lives of others and to get a morsel to rollupon their heavy tongues. Having fallen upon a side light in the life of aMary Underwood they return to it again and again as a dog to its offal.Something touching the lives of such as walk in the clean air, dreamdreams, and have the audacity to be beautiful beyond the beauty of animalyouth, maddens them, and they cry out, running from kitchen door tokitchen door and tearing at the prize like a starved beast who has found acarcass. Let but earnest women found a movement and crowd it forward tothe day when it smacks of success and gives promise of the fine emotion ofachievement, and they fall upon it with a cry, having hysteria rather thanreason as their guiding impulse. In them is all of femininity--and none ofit. For the most part they live and die unseen, unknown, eating rank food,sleeping overmuch, and sitting through summer afternoons rocking in chairsand looking at people passing in the street. In the end they die full offaith, hoping for a life to come.</p><p> Sam stood upon the road fearing the attacks these women were now making onMary Underwood. The moon coming up, threw its light on the fields that laybeside the road and brought out their early spring nakedness and hethought them dreary and hideous, like the faces of the women that had beenmarching through his mind. He drew his overcoat about him and shivered ashe went on, the mud splashing him and the raw night air aggravating thedreariness of his thoughts. He tried to revert to the assurance of thedays before his mother's illness and to get again the strong belief in hisown destiny that had kept him at the money making and saving and had urgedhim to the efforts to rise above the level of the man who bred him. Hedidn't succeed. The feeling of age that had settled upon him in the midstof the people mourning over the body of his mother came back, and,turning, he went along the road toward the town, saying to himself: "Iwill go and talk to Mary Underwood."</p><p> While he waited on the veranda for Mary to open the door, he decided thatafter all a marriage with her might lead to happiness. The half spiritual,half physical love of woman that is the glory and mystery of youth wasgone from him. He thought that if he could only drive from her presencethe fear of the faces that had been coming and going in his own mind hewould, for his own part, be content to live his life as a worker and moneymaker, one without dreams.</p><p> Mary Underwood came to the door wearing the same heavy long coat she hadworn on that other night and taking her by the hand Sam led her to theedge of the veranda. He looked with content at the pine trees before thehouse, thinking that some benign influence must have guided the hand thatplanted them there to stand clothed and decent amid the barrenness of theland at the end of winter.</p><p> "What is it, boy?" asked the woman, and her voice was filled with anxiety.The maternal passion again glowing in her had for days coloured all herthoughts, and with all the ardour of an intense nature she had thrownherself into her love of Sam. Thinking of him, she felt in fancy the pangsof birth, and in her bed at night relived with him his boyhood in the townand built again her plans for his future. In the day time she laughed atherself and said tenderly, "You are an old fool."</p><p> Brutally and frankly Sam told her of the thing he had heard on the stationplatform, looking past her at the pine trees and gripping the verandarail. From the dead land there came again the smell of the new growth asit had come to him on the road before the revelation at the railroadstation.</p><p> "Something kept telling me not to go away," he said. "It must have been inthe air--this thing. Already these evil crawling things were at work. Oh,if only all the world, like you and Telfer and some of the others here,had an appreciation of the sense of privacy."</p><p> Mary Underwood laughed quietly.</p><p> "I was more than half right when, in the old days, I dreamed of making youa man at work upon the things of the mind," she said. "The sense ofprivacy indeed! What a fellow you have become! John Telfer's method wasbetter than my own. He has given you the knack of saying things with aflourish."</p><p> Sam shook his head.</p><p> "Here is something that cannot be faced down with a laugh," he saidstoutly. "Here is something at you--it is tearing at you--it has got to bemet. Even now women are waking up in bed and turning the matter over intheir minds. To-morrow they will be at you again. There is but one way andwe must take it. You and I will have to marry."</p><p> Mary looked at the serious new lines of his face.</p><p> "What a proposal!" she cried.</p><p> On an impulse she began singing, her voice fine and strong running throughthe quiet night.</p><p> "He rode and he thought of her red, red lips,"</p><p> she sang, and laughed again.</p><p> "You should come like that," she said, and then, "you poor muddled boy.Don't you know that I am your new mother?" she added, taking hold of histwo arms and turning him about facing her. "Don't be absurd. I don't wanta husband or a lover. I want a son of my own and I have found him. Iadopted you here in this house that night when you came to me sick andcovered with mud. As for these women--away with them--I'll face them down--I did it once before and I'll do it again. Go to your city and make yourfight. Here in Caxton it is a woman's fight."</p><p> "It is horrible. You don't understand," Sam protested.</p><p> A grey, tired look came into Mary Underwood's face.</p><p> "I understand," she said. "I have been on that battlefield. It is to bewon only by silence and tireless waiting. Your very effort to help wouldmake the matter worse."</p><p> The woman and the tall boy, suddenly become a man, stood in thought. Shewas thinking of the end toward which her life was drifting. Howdifferently she had planned it. She thought of the college inMassachusetts and of the men and women walking under the elm trees there.</p><p> "But I have got me a son and I am going to keep him," she said aloud,putting her hand on Sam's arm.</p><p> Very serious and troubled, Sam went down the gravel path toward the road.He felt there was something cowardly in the part she had given him toplay, but he could see no alternative.</p><p> "After all," he reflected, "it is sensible--it is a woman's battle."</p><p> Half way to the road he stopped and, running back, caught her in his armsand gave her a great hug.</p><p> "Good-bye, little Mother," he cried and kissed her upon the lips.</p><p> And she, watching him as he went again down the gravel path, was overcomewith tenderness. She went to the back of the porch and leaning against thehouse put her head upon her arm. Then turning and smiling through hertears she called after him.</p><p> "Did you crack their heads hard, boy?" she asked.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> From Mary's house Sam went to his own. On the gravel path an idea had cometo him. He went into the house and, sitting down at the kitchen table withpen and ink, began writing. In the sleeping room back of the parlour hecould hear Windy snoring. He wrote carefully, erasing and writing again.Then, drawing up a chair before the kitchen fire, he read over and overwhat he had written, and putting on his coat went through the dawn to thehouse of Tom Comstock, editor of the _Caxton Argus_, and roused him out ofbed.</p><p> "I'll run it on the front page, Sam, and it won't cost you anything,"Comstock promised. "But why run it? Let the matter drop."</p><p> "I shall just have time to pack and get the morning train for Chicago,"Sam thought.</p><p> Early the evening before, Telfer, Wildman, and Freedom Smith, at Valmore'ssuggestion, had made a visit to Hunter's jewelry store. For an hour theybargained, selected, rejected, and swore at the jeweller. When the choicewas made and the gift lay shining against white cotton in a box on thecounter Telfer made a speech.</p><p> "I will talk straight to that boy," he declared, laughing. "I am not goingto spend my time training his mind for money making and then have him failme. I shall tell him that if he doesn't make money in that Chicago I shallcome and take the watch from him."</p><p> Putting the gift into his pocket Telfer went out of the store and alongthe street to Eleanor's shop. He strutted through the display room andinto the workshop where Eleanor sat with a hat on her knee.</p><p> "What am I going to do, Eleanor?" he demanded, standing with legs spreadapart and frowning down upon her, "what am I going to do without Sam?"</p><p> A freckle-faced boy opened the shop door and threw a newspaper on thefloor. The boy had a ringing voice and quick brown eyes. Telfer went againthrough the display room, touching with his cane the posts upon which hungthe finished hats, and whistling. Standing before the shop, with the canehooked upon his arm, he rolled a cigarette and watched the boy runningfrom door to door along the street.</p><p> "I shall have to be adopting a new son," he said musingly.</p><p> After Sam left, Tom Comstock stood in his white nightgown and re-read thestatement just given him. He read it over and over, and then, laying it onthe kitchen table, filled and lighted a corncob pipe. A draft of wind blewinto the room under the kitchen door chilling his thin shanks so that hedrew his bare feet, one after the other, up behind the protective walls ofhis nightgown.</p><p> "On the night of my mother's death," ran the statement, "I sat in thekitchen of our house eating my supper when my father came in and beganshouting and talking loudly, disturbing my mother who was asleep. I put myhand at his throat and squeezed until I thought he was dead, and carriedhim around the house and threw him into the road. Then I ran to the houseof Mary Underwood, who was once my schoolteacher, and told her what I haddone. She took me home, awoke John Telfer, and then went to look for thebody of my father, who was not dead after all. John McPherson knows thisis true, if he can be made to tell the truth."</p><p> Tom Comstock shouted to his wife, a small nervous woman with red cheeks,who set up type in the shop, did her own housework, and gathered most ofthe news and advertising for _The Argus_.</p><p> "Ain't that a slasher?" he asked, handing her the statement Sam hadwritten.</p><p> "Well, it ought to stop the mean things they are saying about MaryUnderwood," she snapped. Then, taking the glasses from her nose, andlooking at Tom, who, while he did not find time to give her much help with_The Argus_, was the best checker player in Caxton and had once been to astate tournament of experts in that sport, she added, "Poor JaneMcPherson, to have had a son like Sam and no better father for him thanthat liar Windy. Choked him, eh? Well, if the men of this town had anyspunk they would finish the job."</p><p> </p><h2>Book II - Chapter 1</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> For two years Sam lived the life of a travelling buyer, visiting towns inIndiana, Illinois, and Iowa, and making deals with men who, like FreedomSmith, bought the farmers' products. On Sundays he sat in chairs beforecountry hotels and walked in the streets of strange towns, or, gettingback to the city at the week end, went through the downtown streets andamong the crowds in the parks with young men he had met on the road. Fromtime to time he went to Caxton and sat for an hour with the men inWildman's, stealing away later for an evening with Mary Underwood.</p><p> In the store he heard news of Windy, who was laying close siege to thefarmer's widow he later married, and who seldom appeared in Caxton. In thestore he saw the boy with freckles on his nose--the same John Telfer hadwatched running along Main Street on the night when he went to showEleanor the gold watch bought for Sam and who sat now on the crackerbarrel in the store and later went with Telfer to dodge the swinging caneand listen to the eloquence poured out on the night air. Telfer had notgot the chance to stand with a crowd about him at the railroad station andmake a parting speech to Sam, and in secret he resented the loss of thatopportunity. After turning the matter over in his mind and thinking ofmany fine flourishes and ringing periods to give colour to the speech hehad been compelled to send the gift by mail. And Sam, while the gift hadtouched him deeply and had brought back to his mind the essential solidgoodness of the town amid the cornfields, so that he lost much of thebitterness aroused by the attack upon Mary Underwood, had been able tomake but a tame and halting reply to the four. In his room in Chicago hehad spent an evening writing and rewriting, putting in and taking outflourishes, and had ended by sending a brief line of thanks.</p><p> Valmore, whose affection for the boy had been a slow growth and who, nowthat he was gone, missed him more than the others, once spoke to FreedomSmith of the change that had come over young McPherson. Freedom sat in thewide old phaeton in the road before Valmore's shop as the blacksmithwalked around the grey mare, lifting her feet and looking at the shoes.</p><p> "What has happened to Sam--he has changed so much?" he asked, dropping afoot of the mare and coming to lean upon the front wheel. "Already thecity has changed him," he added regretfully.</p><p> Freedom took a match from his pocket and lighted the short black pipe.</p><p> "He bites off his words," continued Valmore; "he sits for an hour in thestore and then goes away, and doesn't come back to say good-bye when heleaves town. What has got into him?"</p><p> Freedom gathered up the reins and spat over the dashboard into the dust ofthe road. A dog idling in the street jumped as though a stone had beenhurled at him.</p><p> "If you had something he wanted to buy you would find he talked allright," he exploded. "He skins me out of my eyeteeth every time he comesto town and then gives me a cigar wrapped in tinfoil to make me like it."</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> For some months after his hurried departure from Caxton the changing,hurrying life of the city profoundly interested the tall strong boy fromthe Iowa village, who had the cold, quick business stroke of the moneymaker combined with an unusually active interest in the problems of lifeand of living. Instinctively he looked upon business as a great game inwhich many men sat, and in which the capable, quiet ones waited patientlyuntil a certain moment and then pounced upon what they would possess. Withthe quickness and accuracy of a beast at the kill they pounced and Samfelt that he had that stroke, and in his deals with country buyers used itruthlessly. He knew the vague, uncertain look that came into the eyes ofunsuccessful business men at critical moments and watched for it and tookadvantage of it as a successful prize fighter watches for a similar vague,uncertain look in the eyes of an opponent.</p><p> He had found his work, and had the assurance and the confidence that comeswith that discovery. The stroke that he saw in the hand of the successfulbusiness men about him is the stroke also of the master painter,scientist, actor, singer, prize fighter. It was the hand of Whistler,Balzac, Agassiz, and Terry McGovern. The sense of it had been in him whenas a boy he watched the totals grow in the yellow bankbook, and now andthen he recognised it in Telfer talking on a country road. In the citywhere men of wealth and power in affairs rubbed elbows with him in thestreet cars and walked past him in hotel lobbies he watched and waitedsaying to himself, "I also will be such a one."</p><p> Sam had not lost the vision that had come to him when as a boy he walkedon the road and listened to the talk of Telfer, but he now thought ofhimself as one who had not only a hunger for achievement but also aknowledge of where to look for it. At times he had stirring dreams of vastwork to be done by his hand that made the blood race in him, but for themost part he went his way quietly, making friends, looking about him,keeping his mind busy with his own thoughts, making deals.</p><p> During his first year in the city he lived in the house of an ex-Caxtonfamily named Pergrin that had been in Chicago for several years, but thatstill continued to send its members, one at a time, to spend summervacations in the Iowa village. To these people he carried letters handedhim during the month after his mother's death, and letters regarding himhad come to them from Caxton. In the house, where eight people sat down todinner, only three besides himself were Caxton-bred, but thoughts and talkof the town pervaded the house and crept into every conversation.</p><p> "I was thinking of old John Moore to-day--does he still drive that team ofblack ponies?" the housekeeping sister, a mild-looking woman of thirty,would ask of Sam at the dinner table, breaking in on a conversation ofbaseball, or a tale by one of the boarders of a new office building to beerected in the Loop.</p><p> "No, he don't," Jake Pergrin, a fat bachelor of forty who was foreman in amachine shop and the man of the house, would answer. So long had Jake beenthe final authority in the house on affairs touching Caxton that he lookedupon Sam as an intruder. "John told me last summer when I was home that heintended to sell the blacks and buy mules," he would add, looking at theyouth challengingly.</p><p> The Pergrin family was in fact upon foreign soil. Living amid the roar andbustle of Chicago's vast west side, it still turned with hungry hearttoward the place of corn and of steers, and wished that work for Jake, itsmainstay, could be found in that paradise.</p><p> Jake Pergrin, a bald-headed man with a paunch, stubby iron-grey moustache,and a dark line of machine oil encircling his finger nails so that theystood forth separately like formal flower beds at the edge of a lawn,worked industriously from Monday morning until Saturday night, going tobed at nine o'clock, and until that hour wandering, whistling, from roomto room through the house, in a pair of worn carpet slippers, or sittingin his room practising on a violin. On Saturday evening, the habits formedin his Caxton days being strong in him, he came home with his pay in hispocket, settled with the two sisters for the week's living, sat down todinner neatly shaved and combed, and then disappeared upon the troubledwaters of the town. Late on Sunday evening he re-appeared, with emptypockets, unsteady step, blood-shot eyes, and a noisy attempt at selfpossessed unconcern, to hurry upstairs and crawl into bed in preparationfor another week of toil and respectability. The man had a certainRabelaisian sense of humour and kept score of the new ladies met on hisweekly flights by pencil marks upon his bedroom wall. He once took Samupstairs to show his record. A row of them ran half around the room.</p><p> Besides the bachelor there was a sister, a tall gaunt woman of thirty-fivewho taught school, and the housekeeper, thirty, mild, and blessed with aremarkably sweet speaking voice. Then there was a medical student in thefront room, Sam in an alcove off the hall, a grey-haired womanstenographer, whom Jake called Marie Antoinette, and a buyer from awholesale dry-goods house, with a vivacious, fun-loving little Southernwife.</p><p> The women in the Pergrin house seemed to Sam tremendously concerned abouttheir health and each evening talked of the matter, he thought, more thanhis mother had talked during her illness. While Sam lived with them theywere all under the influence of a strange sort of faith healer and tookwhat they called "Health Suggestion" treatments. Twice each week the faithhealer came to the house, laid his hands upon their backs and took theirmoney. The treatment afforded Jake a never-ending source of amusement andin the evening he went through the house putting his hands upon the backsof the women and demanding money from them, but the dry-goods buyer'swife, who for years had coughed at night, slept peacefully after someweeks of the treatment and the cough did not return while Sam remained inthe house.</p><p> In the house Sam had a standing. Glowing tales of his shrewdness inbusiness, his untiring industry, and the size of his bank account, hadpreceded him from Caxton, and these tales the Pergrins, in their loyaltyto the town and to all the products of the town, did not allow to shrinkin the re-telling. The housekeeping sister, a kindly woman, became fond ofSam, and in his absence would boast of him to chance callers or to theboarders gathered in the living room in the evening. She it was who laidthe foundation of the medical student's belief that Sam was a kind ofgenius in money matters, a belief that enabled him later to make asuccessful assault upon a legacy which came to that young man.</p><p> Frank Eckardt, the medical student, Sam took as a friend. On Sundayafternoons they went to walk in the streets, or, taking two girl friendsof Frank's, who were also students at the medical school, on their arms,they went to the park and sat upon benches under the trees.</p><p> For one of these young women Sam conceived a regard that approachedtenderness. Sunday after Sunday he spent with her, and once, walkingthrough the park on an evening in the late fall, the dry brown leavesrustling under their feet and the sun going down in red splendour beforetheir eyes, he took her hand and walked in silence, feeling tremendouslyalive and vital as he had felt on that other night walking under the treesof Caxton with the dark-skinned daughter of banker Walker.</p><p> That nothing came of the affair and that after a time he did not see thegirl again was due, he thought, to his own growing interest in moneymaking and to the fact that there was in her, as in Frank Eckardt, a blinddevotion to something that he could not himself understand.</p><p> Once he had a talk with Eckardt of the matter. "She is fine and purposefullike a woman I knew in my home town," he said, thinking of Eleanor Telfer,"but she will not talk to me of her work as sometimes she talks to you. Iwant her to talk. There is something about her that I do not understandand that I want to understand. I think that she likes me and once or twiceI have thought she would not greatly mind my making love to her, but I donot understand her just the same."</p><p> One day in the office of the company for which he worked Sam becameacquainted with a young advertising man named Jack Prince, a brisk, verymuch alive young fellow who made money rapidly, spent it lavishly, and hadfriends and acquaintances in every office, every hotel lobby, every barroom and restaurant in the down-town section of the city. The chanceacquaintance rapidly grew into friendship. The clever, witty Prince made akind of hero of Sam, admiring his reserve and good sense and boasting ofhim far and wide through the town. With Prince, Sam occasionally went onmild carouses, and, once, in the midst of thousands of people sittingabout tables and drinking beer at the Coliseum on Wabash Avenue, he andPrince got into a fight with two waiters, Prince declaring he had beencheated and Sam, although he thought his friend in the wrong, striking outwith his fist and dragging Prince through the door and into a passingstreet car in time to avoid a rush of other waiters hurrying to the aid ofthe one who lay dazed and sputtering on the sawdust floor.</p><p> After these evenings of carousal, carried on with Jack Prince and withyoung men met on trains and about country hotels, Sam spent hour afterhour walking about town absorbed in his own thoughts and getting his ownimpressions of what he saw. In the affairs with the young men he played,for the most part, a passive rle, going with them from place to place anddrinking until they became loud and boisterous, or morose and quarrelsome,and then slipping away to his own room, amused or irritated as thecircumstances, or the temperament of his companions, had made or marredthe joviality of the evening. On his nights alone, he put his hands intohis pockets and walked for endless miles through the lighted streets,getting in a dim way a realisation of the hugeness of life. All of thefaces going past him, the women in their furs, the young men with cigarsin their mouths going to the theatres, the bald old men with watery eyes,the boys with bundles of newspapers under their arms, and the slimprostitutes lurking in the hallways, should have interested him deeply. Inhis youth, and with the pride of sleeping power in him, he saw them onlyas so many individuals that might some day test their ability against hisown. And if he peered at them closely and marked down face after face inthe crowds it was as a sitter in the great game of business that helooked, exercising his mind by imagining this or that one arrayed againsthim in deals, and planning the method by which he would win in theimaginary struggle.</p><p> There was at that time in Chicago a place, to be reached by a bridge abovethe Illinois Central Railroad track, that Sam sometimes visited on stormynights to watch the lake lashed by the wind. Great masses of water movingswiftly and silently broke with a roar against wooden piles, backed byhills of stone and earth, and the spray from the broken waves fell uponSam's face and on winter nights froze on his coat. He had learned tosmoke, and leaning upon the railing of the bridge would stand for hourswith a pipe in his mouth looking at the moving water, filled with awe andadmiration of the silent power of it.</p><p> One night in September, when he was walking alone in the streets, anincident happened that showed him also a silent power within himself, apower that startled and for the moment frightened him. Walking into alittle street back of Dearborn, he was suddenly aware of the faces ofwomen looking out at him through small square windows cut in the fronts ofthe houses. Here and there, before and behind him, were the faces; voicescalled, smiles invited, hands beckoned. Up and down the street went menlooking at the sidewalk, their coats turned up about their necks, theirhats pulled down over their eyes. They looked at the faces of the womenpressed against the little squares of glass and then, turning, suddenly,sprang in at the doors of the houses as if pursued. Among the walkers onthe sidewalk were old men, men in shabby coats whose feet scuffled as theyhurried along, and young boys with the pink of virtue in their cheeks. Inthe air was lust, heavy and hideous. It got into Sam's brain and he stoodhesitating and uncertain, startled, nerveless, afraid. He remembered astory he had once heard from John Telfer, a story of the disease and deaththat lurks in the little side streets of cities, and ran into Van BurenStreet and from that into lighted State. He climbed up the stairway of theelevated railroad and jumping on the first train went away south to walkfor hours on a gravel roadway at the edge of the lake in Jackson Park. Thewind from the lake and the laughter and talk of people passing under thelights cooled the fever in him, as once it had been cooled by theeloquence of John Telfer, walking on the road near Caxton, and with hisvoice marshalling the armies of the standing corn.</p><p> Into Sam's mind came a picture of the cold, silent water moving in greatmasses under the night sky and he thought that in the world of men therewas a force as resistless, as little understood, as little talked of,moving always forward, silent, powerful--the force of sex. He wondered howthe force would be broken in his own case, against what breakwater itwould spend itself. At midnight, he went home across the city and creptinto his alcove in the Pergrin house, puzzled and for the time utterlytired. In his bed, he turned his face to the wall and resolutely closinghis eyes tried to sleep. "There are things not to be understood," he toldhimself. "To live decently is a matter of good sense. I will keep thinkingof what I want to do and not go into such a place again."</p><p> One day, when he had been in Chicago two years, there happened an incidentof another sort, an incident so grotesque, so Pan-like, so full of youth,that for days after it happened he thought of it with delight, and walkedin the streets or sat in a passenger train laughing joyfully at theremembrance of some new detail of the affair.</p><p> Sam, who was the son of Windy McPherson and who had more than onceruthlessly condemned all men who put liquor into their mouths, got drunk,and for eighteen hours went shouting poetry, singing songs, and yelling atthe stars like a wood god on the bend.</p><p> Late on an afternoon in the early spring he sat with Jack Prince inDeJonge's restaurant in Monroe Street. Prince, his watch lying before himon the table and the thin stem of a wine glass between his fingers, talkedto Sam of the man for whom they had been waiting a half hour.</p><p> "He will be late, of course," he exclaimed, refilling Sam's glass. "Theman was never on time in his life. To keep an appointment promptly wouldtake something from him. It would be like the bloom of youth gone from thecheeks of a maiden."</p><p> Sam had already seen the man for whom they waited. He was thirty-five,small and narrow-shouldered, with a little wrinkled face, a huge nose, anda pair of eyeglasses that hooked over his ears. Sam had seen him in aMichigan Avenue club with Prince solemnly pitching silver dollars at achalk mark on the floor with a group of serious, solid-looking old men.</p><p> "They are the crowd that have just put through the big deal in Kansas oilstock and the little one is Morris, who handled the publicity for them,"Prince had explained.</p><p> Later, when they were walking down Michigan Avenue, Prince talked atlength of Morris, whom he admired immensely. "He is the best advertisingand publicity man in America," he declared. "He isn't a four-flusher, as Iam, and does not make as much money, but he can take another man's ideasand express them so simply and forcibly that they tell the man's storybetter than he knew it himself. And that's all there is to advertising."</p><p> He began laughing.</p><p> "It is funny to think of it. Tom Morris will do a job of work and the manfor whom he does it will swear that he did it himself, that every patphrase on the printed page Tom has turned out, is one of his own. He willhowl like a beast at paying Tom's bill, and then the next time he will tryto do the job himself and make a hopeless muddle of it so that he has tosend for Tom only to see the trick done over again like shelling corn offthe cob. The best men in Chicago send for him."</p><p> Into the restaurant came Tom Morris bearing under his arm a hugepasteboard portfolio. He seemed hurried and nervous. "I am on my way tothe office of the International Biscuit Turning Machine Company," heexplained to Prince. "I can't stop at all. I have here the layout of acircular designed to push on to the market some more of that common stockof theirs that hasn't paid a dividend for ten years."</p><p> Thrusting out his hand, Prince dragged Morris into a chair. "Never mindthe Biscuit Machine people and their stock," he commanded; "they willalways have common stock to sell. It is inexhaustible. I want you to meetMcPherson here who will some day have something big for you to help himwith."</p><p> Morris reached across the table and took Sam's hand; his own was small andsoft like that of a woman. "I am worked to death," he complained; "I havemy eye on a chicken farm in Indiana. I am going down there to live."</p><p> For an hour the three men sat in the restaurant while Prince talked of aplace in Wisconsin where the fish should be biting. "A man has told me of</p><p> the place twenty times," he declared; "I am sure I could find it on arailroad folder. I have never been fishing nor have you, and Sam herecomes from a place to which they carry water in wagons over the plains."</p><p> The little man who had been drinking copiously of the wine looked fromPrince to Sam. From time to time he took off his glasses and wiped themwith a handkerchief. "I don't understand your being in such society," heannounced; "you have the solid, substantial look of a bucket-shop man.Prince here will get nowhere. He is honest, sells wind and his charmingsociety, and spends the money that he gets, instead of marrying andputting it in his wife's name."</p><p> Prince arose. "It is useless to waste time in persiflage," he began andthen turning to Sam, "There is a place in Wisconsin," he said uncertainly.</p><p> Morris picked up the portfolio and with a grotesque effort at steadinessstarted for the door followed by Prince and Sam walking with waveringsteps. In the street Prince took the portfolio out of the little man'shand. "Let your mother carry it, Tommy," he said, shaking his finger underMorris's nose. He began singing a lullaby. "When the bough bends thecradle will fall."</p><p> The three men walked out of Monroe and into State Street, Sam's headfeeling strangely light. The buildings along the street reeled against thesky. A sudden fierce longing for wild adventure seized him. On a cornerMorris stopped, took the handkerchief from his pocket and again wiped hisglasses. "I want to be sure that I see clearly," he said; "it seems to methat in the bottom of that last glass of wine I saw three of us in a cabwith a basket of life oil on the seat between us going to the station tocatch the train for that place Jack's friend told fish lies about."</p><p> The next eighteen hours opened up a new world to Sam. With the fumes ofliquor rising in his brain, he rode for two hours on a train, tramped inthe darkness along dusty roads and, building a bonfire in a woods, dancedin the light of it upon the grass, holding the hands of Prince and thelittle man with the wrinkled face. Solemnly he stood upon a stump at theedge of a wheatfield and recited Poe's "Helen," taking on the voice, thegestures and even the habit of spreading his legs apart, of John Telfer.And then overdoing the last, he sat down suddenly on the stump, andMorris, coming forward with a bottle in his hand said, "Fill the lamp,man--the light of reason has gone out."</p><p> From the bonfire in the woods and Sam's recital from the stump, the threefriends emerged again upon the road, and a belated farmer driving homehalf asleep on the seat of his wagon caught their attention. With theskill of an Indian boy the diminutive Morris sprang upon the wagon andthrust a ten dollar bill into the farmer's hand. "Lead us, O man of thesoil!" he shouted, "Lead us to a gilded palace of sin! Take us to asaloon! The life oil gets low in the can!"</p><p> Beyond the long, jolting ride in the wagon Sam never became quite clear.In his mind ran vague notions of a wild carousal in a country tavern, ofhimself acting as bartender, and a huge red-faced woman rushing here andthere under the direction of a tiny man, dragging reluctant rustics to thebar and commanding them to keep on drinking the beer that Sam drew untilthe last of the ten dollars given to the man of the wagon should have goneinto her cash drawer. Also, he thought that Jack Prince had put a chairupon the bar and that he sat on it explaining to the hurrying drawer ofbeer that although the Egyptian kings had built great pyramids tocelebrate themselves they never built anything more gigantic than the jagTom Morris was building among the farm hands in the room.</p><p> Later Sam thought that he and Jack Prince tried to sleep under a pile ofgrain sacks in a shed and that Morris came to them weeping because everyone in the world was asleep and most of them lying under tables.</p><p> And then, his head clearing, Sam found himself with the two others walkingagain upon the dusty road in the dawn and singing songs.</p><p> On the train, with the help of a Negro porter, the three men tried toefface the dust and the stains of the wild night. The pasteboard portfoliocontaining the circular for the Biscuit Machine Company was still underJack Prince's arm and the little man, wiping and re-wiping his glasses,peered at Sam.</p><p> "Did you come with us or are you a child we have adopted here in theseparts?" he asked.</p><p> </p><h2>Book II - Chapter 2</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> It was a wonderful place, that South Water Street in Chicago where Samcame to make his business start in the city, and it was proof of the dryunresponsiveness in him that he did not sense more fully its meaning andits message. All day the food stuff of a vast city flowed through thenarrow streets. Blue-shirted, broad-shouldered teamsters from the tops ofhigh piled wagons bawled at scurrying pedestrians. On the sidewalks inboxes, bags, and barrels, lay oranges from Florida and California, figsfrom Arabia, bananas from Jamaica, nuts from the hills of Spain and theplains of Africa, cabbages from Ohio, beans from Michigan, corn andpotatoes from Iowa. In December, fur-coated men hurried through theforests of northern Michigan gathering Christmas trees that found theirway to warm firesides through the street. And summer and winter a millionhens laid the eggs that were gathered there, and the cattle on a thousandhills sent their yellow butter fat packed in tubs and piled upon trucks toadd to the confusion.</p><p> Into this street Sam walked, thinking little of the wonder of these thingsand thinking haltingly, getting his sense of the bigness of it in dollarsand cents. Standing in the doorway of the commission house for which hewas to work, strong, well clad, able and efficient, he looked through thestreets, seeing and hearing the hurry and the roar and the shouting ofvoices, and then with a smile upon his lips went inside. In his brain wasan unexpressed thought. As the old Norse marauders looked at the citiessitting in their splendour on the Mediterranean so looked he. "What loot!"a voice within him said, and his brain began devising methods by which heshould get his share of it.</p><p> Years later, when Sam was a man of big affairs, he drove one day in acarriage through the streets and turning to his companion, a grey-haired,dignified Boston man who sat beside him, said, "I worked here once andused to sit on a barrel of apples at the edge of the sidewalk thinking howclever I was to make more money in one month than the man who raised theapples made in a year."</p><p> The Boston man, stirred by the sight of so much foodstuff and moved toepigram by his mood, looked up and down the street.</p><p> "The foodstuff of an empire rattling o'er the stones," he said.</p><p> "I should have made more money here," answered Sam dryly.</p><p> The commission firm for which Sam worked was a partnership, not acorporation, and was owned by two brothers. Of the two Sam thought thatthe elder, a tall, bald, narrow-shouldered man, with a long narrow faceand a suave manner, was the real master, and represented most of theability in the partnership. He was oily, silent, tireless. All day he wentin and out of the office and warehouses and up and down the crowdedstreet, sucking nervously at an unlighted cigar. He was a great worker ina suburban church, but a shrewd and, Sam suspected, an unscrupulousbusiness man. Occasionally the minister or some of the women of thesuburban church came into the office to talk with him, and Sam was amusedat the thought that Narrow Face, when he talked of the affairs of thechurch, bore a striking resemblance to the brown-bearded minister of thechurch in Caxton.</p><p> The other brother was a far different sort, and, in business, Sam thought,a much inferior man. He was a heavy, broad-shouldered, square-faced man ofabout thirty, who sat in the office dictating letters and who stayed outtwo or three hours to lunch. He sent out letters signed by him on thefirm's stationery with the title of General Manager, and Narrow Face lethim do it. Broad Shoulders had been educated in New England and even afterseveral years away from his college seemed more interested in it than inthe welfare of the business. For a month or more in the spring he tookmost of the time of one of the two stenographers employed by the firmwriting letters to graduates of Chicago high schools to induce them to goEast to finish their education; and when a graduate of the college came toChicago seeking employment, he closed his desk and spent entire days goingfrom place to place, introducing, urging, recommending. Sam noticed,however, that when the firm employed a new man in their own office or onthe road it was Narrow-Face who chose the man.</p><p> Broad-shoulders had been a famous football player in his day and wore aniron brace on his leg. The offices, like most of the offices on thestreet, were dark and narrow, and smelled of decaying vegetables andrancid butter. Noisy Greek and Italian hucksters wrangled on the sidewalkin front, and among these went Narrow-Face hurrying about making deals.</p><p> In South Water Street Sam did well, multiplying his thirty-six hundreddollars by ten during the three years that he stayed there, or went outfrom there to towns and cities directing a part of the great flowing riverof foodstuff through his firm's front door.</p><p> With almost his first day on the street he began seeing on all sides ofhim opportunity for gain, and set himself industriously at work to get hishand upon money with which to take advantage of the chances that hethought lay so invitingly about. Within a year he had made much progress.From a woman on Wabash Avenue he got six thousand dollars, and he plannedand executed a coup that gave him the use of twenty thousand dollars thathad come as a legacy to his friend, the medical student, who lived at thePergrin house.</p><p> Sam had eggs and apples lying in warehouse against a rise; game, smuggledacross the state line from Michigan and Wisconsin, lay frozen in coldstorage tagged with his name and ready to be sold at a long profit tohotels and fashionable restaurants; and there were even secret bushels ofcorn and wheat lying in other warehouses along the Chicago River ready tobe thrown on the market at a word from him, or, the margins by which hekept his hold on the stuff not being forthcoming, at a word from a LaSalleStreet broker.</p><p> Getting the twenty thousand dollars out of the hands of the medicalstudent was a turning point in Sam's life. Sunday after Sunday he walkedwith Eckardt in the streets or loitered with him in the parks thinking ofthe money lying idle in the bank and of the deals he might be turning withit in the street or on the road. Daily he saw more clearly the power ofcash. Other commission merchants along South Water Street came runninginto the office of his firm with tense, anxious faces asking Narrow-Faceto help them over rough spots in the day's trading. Broad-Shoulders, whohad no business ability but who had married a rich woman, went on monthafter month taking half the profits brought in by the ability of his tall,shrewd brother, and Narrow-Face, who had taken a liking for Sam and whooccasionally stopped for a word with him, spoke of the matter often andeloquently.</p><p> "Spend your time with no one who hasn't money to help you," he said; "onthe road look for the men with money and then try to get it. That's allthere is to business--money-getting." And then looking across to the deskof his brother he would add, "I would kick half the men in business out ofit if I could, but I myself must dance to the tune that money plays."</p><p> One day Sam went to the office of an attorney named Webster, whosereputation for the shrewd drawing of contracts had come to him fromNarrow-Face.</p><p> "I want a contract drawn that will give me absolute control of twentythousand dollars with no risk on my part if I lose the money and nopromise to pay more than seven per cent if I do not lose," he said.</p><p> The attorney, a slender, middle-aged man with a swarthy skin and blackhair, put his hands on the desk before him and looked at the tall youngman.</p><p> "What collateral?" he asked.</p><p> Sam shook his head. "Can you draw such a contract that will be legal andwhat will it cost me?" he asked.</p><p> The lawyer laughed good naturedly. "I can draw it of course. Why not?"</p><p> Sam, taking a roll of bills from his pocket, counted the amount upon thetable.</p><p> "Who are you anyway?" asked Webster. "If you can get twenty thousand andwithout collateral you're worth knowing. I might be getting up a gang torob a mail train."</p><p> Sam did not answer. He put the contract in his pocket and went home to hisalcove at the Pergrins. He wanted to get by himself and think. He did notbelieve that he would by any chance lose Frank Eckardt's money, but heknew that Eckardt himself would draw back from the kind of deals that heexpected to make with the money, that they would frighten and alarm him,and he wondered if he was being honest.</p><p> In his own room after dinner Sam studied carefully the agreement drawn byWebster. It seemed to him to cover what he wanted covered, and having gotit well fixed in his mind he tore it up. "There is no use his knowing Ihave been to a lawyer," he thought guiltily.</p><p> Getting into bed, he began building plans for the future. With more thanthirty thousand dollars at his command he thought that he should be ableto make headway rapidly. "In my hands it will double itself every year,"he told himself and getting out of bed he drew a chair to the window andsat down, feeling strangely alive and awake like a young man in love. Hesaw himself going on and on, directing, managing, ruling men. It seemed tohim that there was nothing he could not do. "I will run factories andbanks and maybe mines and railroads," he thought and his mind leapedforward so that he saw himself, grey, stern, and capable, sitting at abroad desk high in a great stone building, a materialisation of JohnTelfer's word picture--"You will be a big man of dollars--it is plain."</p><p> And then into Sam's mind came another picture. He remembered a Saturdayafternoon when a young man had come running into the office on South WaterStreet, a young man who owed Narrow-Face a sum of money and could not payit. He remembered the unpleasant tightening of the mouth and the suddenshrewd hard look in his employer's long narrow face. He had not heard muchof the talk, but he was aware of a strained pleading quality in the voiceof the young man who had said over and over slowly and painfully, "But,man, my honour is at stake," and of a coldness in the answering voicereplying persistently, "With me it is not a matter of honour but ofdollars, and I am going to get them."</p><p> From the alcove window Sam looked out upon a vacant lot covered withpatches of melting snow. Beyond the lot facing him stood a flat building,and the snow, melting on the roof, made a little stream that ran down somehidden pipe and rattled out upon the ground. The noise of the fallingwater and the sound of distant footsteps going homeward through thesleeping city brought back thoughts of other nights when as a boy inCaxton he had sat thus, thinking disconnected thoughts.</p><p> Without knowing it Sam was fighting one of the real battles of his life, abattle in which the odds were very much against the quality in him thatgot him out of bed to look at the snow-clad vacant lot.</p><p> There was in the youth much of the brute trader, blindly intent upon gain;much of the quality that has given America so many of its so-called greatmen. It was the quality that had sent him in secret to Lawyer Webster toprotect himself without protecting the simple credulous young medicalstudent, and that had made him say as he came home with the contract inhis pocket, "I will do what I can," when in truth he meant, "I will getwhat I can."</p><p> There may be business men in America who do not get what they can, whosimply love power. One sees men here and there in banks, at the heads ofgreat industrial trusts, in factories and in great mercantile houses ofwhom one would like to think thus. They are the men who one dreams havehad an awakening, who have found themselves; they are the men hopefulthinkers try to recall again and again to the mind.</p><p> To these men America is looking. It is asking them to keep the faith, tostand themselves up against the force of the brute trader, the dollar man,the man who with his one cunning wolf quality of acquisitiveness has toolong ruled the business of the nation.</p><p> I have said that the sense of equity in Sam fought an unequal battle. Hewas in business, and young in business, in a day when all America wasseized with a blind grappling for gain. The nation was drunk with it,trusts were being formed, mines opened; from the ground spurted oil andgas; railroads creeping westward opened yearly vast empires of new land.To be poor was to be a fool; thought waited, art waited; and men at theirfiresides gathered their children around them and talked glowingly of menof dollars, holding them up as prophets fit to lead the youth of the youngnation.</p><p> Sam had in him the making of the new, the commanding man of business. Itwas that quality in him that made him sit by the window thinking beforegoing to the medical student with the unfair contract, and the samequality had sent him forth night after night to walk alone in the streetswhen other young men went to theatres or to walk with girls in the park.He had, in truth, a taste for the lonely hours when thought grows. He wasa step beyond the youth who hurries to the theatre or buries himself instories of love or adventure. He had in him something that wanted achance.</p><p> In the flat building across the vacant lot a light appeared at a windowand through the lighted window he saw a man clad in pajamas who propped asheet of music against a dressing-table and who had a shining silver hornin his hand. Sam watched, filled with mild curiosity. The man, notreckoning on an onlooker at so late an hour, began an elaborate andamusing schedule of personation. He opened the window, put the horn to hislips and then turning bowed before the lighted room as before an audience.He put his hand to his lips and blew kisses about, then put the horn tohis lips and looked again at the sheet of music.</p><p> The note that came out of the window on the still air was a failure, itflattened into a squawk. Sam laughed and pulled down the window. Theincident had brought back to his mind another man who bowed to a crowd andblew upon a horn. Getting into bed he pulled the covers about him and wentto sleep. "I will get Frank's money if I can," he told himself, settlingthe matter that had been in his mind. "Most men are fools and if I do notget his money some other man will."</p><p> On the next afternoon Eckardt had lunch down town with Sam. Together theywent to a bank where Sam showed the profits of deals he had made and thegrowth of his bank account, going afterward into South Water Street whereSam talked glowingly of the money to be made by a shrewd man who knew theways of the street and had a head upon his shoulders.</p><p> "That's just it," said Frank Eckardt, falling quickly into the trap Samhad set, and hungering for profits; "I have money but no head on myshoulders for using it. I wish you would take it and see what you can do."</p><p> With a thumping heart Sam went home across the city to the Pergrin house,Eckardt beside him in the elevated train. In Sam's room the agreement waswritten out by Sam and signed by Eckardt. At dinner time they had thedrygoods buyer in to sign as witness.</p><p> And the agreement turned out to Eckardt's advantage. In no year did Samreturn him less than ten per cent, and in the end gave back the principalmore than doubled so that Eckardt was able to retire from the practice ofmedicine and live upon the interest of his capital in a village nearTiffin, Ohio.</p><p> With the thirty thousand dollars in his hands Sam began to reach out andextend the scope of his ventures. He bought and sold constantly, not onlyeggs, butter, apples, and grain, but also houses and building lots.Through his head marched long rows of figures. Deals worked themselves outin detail in his brain as he went about town drinking with young men, orsat at dinner in the Pergrin house. He even began working over in his headvarious schemes for getting into the firm by which he was employed, andthought that he might work upon Broad-Shoulders, getting hold of hisinterest and forcing himself into control. And then, the fear of NarrowFace holding him back and his growing success in deals keeping his mindoccupied, he was suddenly confronted by an opportunity that changedentirely the plans he was making for himself.</p><p> Through Jack Prince's suggestion Colonel Tom Rainey of the great RaineyArms Company sent for him and offered him a position as buyer of all thematerials used in their factories.</p><p> It was the kind of connection Sam had unconsciously been seeking--acompany, strong, old, conservative, known throughout the world. There was,in the talk with Colonel Tom, a hint of future opportunities to get stockin the company and perhaps to become eventually an official--these thingswere of course remote--to be dreamed of and worked toward--the companymade it a part of its policy.</p><p> Sam said nothing, but already he had decided to accept the place, and wasthinking of a profitable arrangement touching percentages on the amountsaved in buying that had worked out so well for him during his years withFreedom Smith.</p><p> Sam's work for the firearms company took him off the road and confined himto an office all day long. In a way he regretted this. The complaints hehad heard among travelling men in country hotels with regard to thehardship of travel meant nothing to his mind. Any kind of travel was akeen pleasure to him. Against the hardships and discomforts he balancedthe tremendous advantages of seeing new places and faces and getting alook into many lives, and he looked back with a kind of retrospective joyon the three years of hurrying from place to place, catching trains, andtalking with chance acquaintances met by the way. Also, the years on theroad had given him many opportunities for secret and profitable deals ofhis own.</p><p> Over against these advantages the place at Rainey's threw him into closeand continuous association with men of big affairs. The offices of theArms Company occupied an entire floor of one of Chicago's newest andbiggest skyscrapers and millionaire stockholders and men high in theservice of the state and of the government at Washington came in and wentout at the door. Sam looked at them closely. He wanted to have a tilt withthem and try if his Caxton and South Water Street shrewdness would keepthe head upon his shoulders in LaSalle Street. The opportunity seemed tohim a big one and he went about his work quietly and ably, intent uponmaking the most of it.</p><p> The Rainey Arms Company, at the time of Sam's coming with it, was stilllargely owned by the Rainey family, father and daughter. Colonel Rainey, agrey-whiskered military looking man with a paunch, was the president andlargest individual stockholder. He was a pompous, swaggering old fellowwith a habit of making the most trivial statement with the air of a judgepronouncing the death sentence, and sat dutifully at his desk day afterday looking very important and thoughtful, smoking long black cigars andsigning personally piles of letters brought him by the heads of variousdepartments. He looked upon himself as a silent but very important spokein the government at Washington and every day issued many orders which themen at the heads of departments received with respect and disregarded insecret. Twice he had been prominently mentioned in connection with cabinetpositions in the national government, and in talks with his cronies atclubs and restaurants he gave the impression of having actually refused anoffer of appointment on both occasions.</p><p> Having got himself established as a factor in the management of thebusiness, Sam found many things that surprised him. In every company ofwhich he knew there was some one man to whom all looked for guidance, whoat critical moments became dominant, saying "Do this, or that," and makingno explanations. In the Rainey Company he found no such man, but, instead,a dozen strong departments, each with its own head and each more or lessindependent of the others.</p><p> Sam lay in his bed at night and went about in the evening thinking of thisand of its meaning. Among the department heads there was a great deal ofloyalty and devotion to Colonel Tom, and he thought that among them were afew men who were devoted to other interests than their own.</p><p> At the same time he told himself there was something wrong. He himself hadno such feeling of loyalty and although he was willing to give lip serviceto the resounding talk of the colonel about the fine old traditions of thecompany, he could not bring himself to a belief in the idea of conductinga vast business on a system founded upon lip service to traditions, orupon loyalty to an individual.</p><p> "There must be loose ends lying about everywhere," he thought and followedthe thought with another. "A man will come along, pick up these looseends, and run the whole shop. Why not I?"</p><p> The Rainey Arms Company had made its millions for the Rainey and Whittakerfamilies during the Civil War. Whittaker had been an inventor, making oneof the first practical breech-loading guns, and the original Rainey hadbeen a dry-goods merchant in an Illinois town who backed the inventor.</p><p> It proved itself a rare combination. Whittaker developed into a wonderfulshop manager for his day, and, from the first, stayed at home buildingrifles and making improvements, enlarging the plant, getting out thegoods. The drygoods merchant scurried about the country, going toWashington and to the capitals of the individual states, pulling wires,appealing to patriotism and state pride, taking big orders at fat prices.</p><p> In Chicago there is a tradition that more than once he went south of theDixie line and that following these trips thousands of Rainey-Whittakerrifles found their way into the hands of Confederate soldiers, but thisstory which increased Sam's respect for the energetic little drygoodsmerchant, Colonel Tom, his son, indignantly denied. In reality Colonel Tomwould have liked to think of the first Rainey as a huge, Jove-like god ofarms. Like Windy McPherson of Caxton, given a chance, he would haveinvented a new ancestor.</p><p> After the Civil War, and Colonel Tom's growing to manhood, the Rainey andWhittaker fortunes were merged into one through the marriage of JaneWhittaker, the last of her line, to the only surviving Rainey, and uponher death her fortune, grown to more than a million, stood in the name ofSue Rainey, twenty-six, the only issue of the marriage.</p><p> From the first day, Sam began to forge ahead in the Rainey Company. In thebuying end he found a rich field for spectacular money saving and moneymaking and made the most of it. The position as buyer had for ten yearsbeen occupied by a distant cousin to Colonel Tom, now dead. Whether thecousin was a fool or a knave Sam could never quite decide and did notgreatly care, but after he had got the situation in hand he felt that theman must have cost the company a tremendous sum, which _he_ intended tosave.</p><p> Sam's arrangement with the company gave him, besides a fair salary, halfhe saved in the fixed prices of standard materials. These prices had stoodfixed for years and Sam went into them, cutting right and left, and makingfor himself during his first year twenty-three thousand dollars. At theend of the year, when the directors asked to have an adjustment made andthe percentage contract annulled, he got a generous slice of companystock, the respect of Colonel Tom Rainey and the directors, the fear ofsome of the department heads, the loyal devotion of others, and the titleof Treasurer of the company.</p><p> The Rainey Arms Company was in truth living largely upon the reputationbuilt up for it by the first pushing energetic Rainey, and the inventivegenius of his partner, Whittaker. Under Colonel Tom it had found newconditions and new competition which he had ignored, or met in a halfhearted way, standing on its reputation, its financial strength, and onthe glory of its past achievements. Dry rot ate at its heart. The damagedone was not great, but was growing greater. The heads of the departments,in whose hands so much of the running of the business lay, were many ofthem incompetent men with nothing to commend them but long years ofservice. And in the treasurer's office sat a quiet young man, barelyturned twenty, who had no friends, wanted his own way, and who shook hishead over the office traditions and was proud of his unbelief.</p><p> Seeing the absolute necessity of working through Colonel Tom, and having ahead filled with ideas of things he wanted done, Sam began working to getsuggestions into the older man's mind. Within a month after his elevationthe two men were lunching together daily and Sam was spending many extrahours behind closed doors in Colonel Tom's office.</p><p> Although American business and manufacturing had not yet achieved themodern idea of efficiency in shop and office management, Sam had many ofthese ideas in his mind and expounded them tirelessly to Colonel Tom. Hehated waste; he cared nothing for company tradition; he had no idea, asdid the heads of other departments, of getting into a comfortable berthand spending the rest of his days there, and he was bent on managing thegreat Rainey Company, if not directly, then through Colonel Tom, who, hefelt, was putty in his hands.</p><p> From his new position as treasurer Sam did not drop his work as buyer,but, after a talk with Colonel Tom, merged the two departments, put incapable assistants of his own, and went on with his work of effacing thetracks of the cousin. For years the company had been overpaying forinferior material. Sam put his own material inspectors into the west sidefactories and brought several big Pennsylvania steel companies scurryingto Chicago to make restitution. The restitution was stiff, but whenColonel Tom was appealed to, Sam went to lunch with him, bought a bottleof wine, and stiffened his back.</p><p> One afternoon in a room in the Palmer House a scene was played out thatfor days stayed in Sam's mind as a kind of realisation of the part hewanted to play in the business world. The president of a lumber companytook Sam into the room, and, laying five one thousand dollar bills upon atable, walked to the window and stood looking out.</p><p> For a moment Sam stood looking at the money on the table and at the backof the man by the window, burning with indignation. He felt that he shouldlike to take hold of the man's throat and press as he had once pressed onthe throat of Windy McPherson. And then a cold gleam coming into his eyeshe cleared his throat and said, "You are short here; you will have tobuild this pile higher if you expect to interest me."</p><p> The man by the window shrugged his shoulders--he was a slender, younglooking man in a fancy waistcoat--and then turning and taking a roll ofbills from his pocket he walked to the table, facing Sam.</p><p> "I shall expect you to be reasonable," he said, as he laid the bills onthe table.</p><p> When the pile had reached twenty thousand, Sam reached out his hand andtaking it up put it in his pocket. "You will get a receipt for this when Iget back to the office," he said; "it is about what you owe our companyfor overcharges and crooked material. As for our business, I made acontract with another company this morning."</p><p> Having got the buying end of the Rainey Arms Company straightened out tohis liking, Sam began spending much time in the shops and, through ColonelTom, forced big changes everywhere. He discharged useless foremen, knockedout partitions between rooms, pushed everywhere for more and better work.Like the modern efficiency man, he went about with a watch in his hand,cutting out lost motion, rearranging, getting his own way.</p><p> It was a time of great agitation. The offices and shops buzzed like beesdisturbed and black looks followed him about. But Colonel Tom rose to thesituation and went about at Sam's heels, swaggering, giving orders,throwing back his shoulders like a man remade. All day long he was at it,discharging, directing, roaring against waste. When a strike broke out inone of the shops because of innovations Sam had forced upon the workmenthere, he got upon a bench and delivered a speech--written by Sam--on aman's place in the organisation and conducting of a great modern industryand his duty to perfect himself as a workman.</p><p> Silently, the men picked up their tools and started again for theirbenches and when he saw them thus affected by his words Colonel Tombrought what threatened to be a squally affair to a hurrahing climax bythe announcement of a five per cent increase in the wage scale--that wasColonel Tom's own touch and the rousing reception of it brought a glow ofpride to his cheeks.</p><p> Although the affairs of the company were still being handled by ColonelTom, and though he daily more and more asserted himself, the officers andshops, and later the big jobbers and buyers as well as the rich LaSalleStreet directors, knew that a new force had come into the company. Menbegan dropping quietly into Sam's office, asking questions, suggesting,seeking favours. He felt that he was getting hold. Of the departmentheads, about half fought him and were secretly marked for slaughter; theothers came to him, expressed approval of what was going on and asked himto look over their departments and to make suggestions for improvementsthrough them. This Sam did eagerly, getting by it their loyalty andsupport which later stood him in good stead.</p><p> In choosing the new men that came into the company Sam also took a hand.The method used was characteristic of his relations with Colonel Tom. If aman applying for a place suited him, he got admission to the colonel'soffice and listened for half an hour to a talk anent the fine oldtraditions of the company. If a man did not suit Sam, he did not get tothe colonel. "You can't have your time taken up by them," Sam explained.</p><p> In the Rainey Company, the various heads of departments were stockholdersin the company, and selected from among themselves two men to sit upon theboard, and in his second year Sam was chosen as one of these employeedirectors. During the same year five heads of departments resigning in amoment of indignation over one of Sam's innovations--to be replaced laterby two--their stock by a prearranged agreement came back into thecompany's hands. This stock and another block, secured for him by thecolonel, got into Sam's hands through the use of Eckardt's money, that ofthe Wabash Avenue woman, and his own snug pile.</p><p> Sam was a growing force in the company. He sat on the board of directors,the recognised practical head of the business among its stockholders andemployees; he had stopped the company's march toward a second place in itsindustry and had faced it about. All about him, in offices and shops,there was the swing and go of new life and he felt that he was in aposition to move on toward real control and had begun laying lines withthat end in view. Standing in the offices in LaSalle Street or amid theclang and roar of the shops he tilted up his chin with the same odd littlegesture that had attracted the men of Caxton to him when he was a barefootnewsboy and the son of the town drunkard. Through his head went bigambitious projects. "I have in my hand a great tool," he thought; "with itI will pry my way into the place I mean to occupy among the big men ofthis city and this nation."</p><h2>Book II - Chapter 3</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sam McPherson, who stood in the shops among the thousands of employees ofthe Rainey Arms Company, who looked with unseeing eyes at the faces of themen intent upon the operation of machines and saw in them but so many aidsto the ambitious projects stirring in his brain, who, while yet a boy, hadbecause of the quality of daring in him, combined with a gift ofacquisitiveness, become a master, who was untrained, uneducated, knowingnothing of the history of industry or of social effort, walked out of theoffices of his company and along through the crowded streets to the newapartment he had taken on Michigan Avenue. It was Saturday evening at theend of a busy week and as he walked he thought of things he hadaccomplished during the week and made plans for the one to come. ThroughMadison Street he went and into State, seeing the crowds of men and women,boys and girls, clambering aboard the cable cars, massed upon thepavements, forming in groups, the groups breaking and reforming, and thewhole making a picture intense, confusing, awe-inspiring. As in the shopsamong the men workers, so here, also, walked the youth with unseeing eyes.He liked it all; the mass of people; the clerks in their cheap clothing;the old men with young girls on their arms going to dine in restaurants;the young man with a wistful look in his eyes waiting for his sweetheartin the shadow of the towering office building. The eager, straining rushof the whole, seemed no more to him than a kind of gigantic setting foraction; action controlled by a few quiet, capable men--of whom he intendedto be one--intent upon growth.</p><p> In State Street he stopped at a shop and buying a bunch of roses came outagain upon the crowded street. In the crowd before him walked a woman-tall, freewalking, with a great mass of reddish-brown hair on her head. Asshe passed through the crowd men stopped and looked back at her, theireyes ablaze with admiration. Seeing her, Sam sprang forward with a cry.</p><p> "Edith!" he called, and running forward thrust the roses into her hand."For Janet," he said, and lifting his hat walked beside her along State toVan Buren Street.</p><p> Leaving the woman at a corner Sam came into a region of cheap theatres anddingy hotels. Women spoke to him; young men in flashy overcoats and with apeculiar, assertive, animal swing to their shoulders loitered before thetheatres or in the doorways of the hotels; from an upstairs restaurantcame the voice of another young man singing a popular song of the street."There'll be a hot time in the old town to-night," sang the voice.</p><p> Over a cross street Sam went into Michigan Avenue, faced by a long narrowpark and beyond the railroad tracks by the piles of new earth where thecity was trying to regain its lake front. In the cross street, standing inthe shadow of the elevated railroad, he had passed a whining, intoxicatedold woman who lurched forward and put a hand upon his coat. Sam had flungher a quarter and passed on shrugging his shoulders. Here also he hadwalked with unseeing eyes; this too was a part of the gigantic machinewith which the quiet, competent men of growth worked.</p><p> From his new quarters in the top floor of the hotel facing the lake, Samwalked north along Michigan Avenue to a restaurant where Negro men wentnoiselessly about among white-clad tables, serving men and women whotalked and laughed under the shaded lamps had an assured, confident air.Passing in at the door of the restaurant, a wind, blowing over the citytoward the lake, brought the sound of a voice floating with it. "There'llbe a hot time in the old town to-night," again insisted the voice.</p><p> After dining Sam got on a grip car of the Wabash Avenue Cable, sitting onthe front seat and letting the panorama of the town roll up to him. Fromthe region of cheap theatres he passed through streets in which saloonsstood massed, one beside another, each with its wide garish doorway andits dimly lighted "Ladies' Entrance," and into a region of neat littlestores where women with baskets upon their arms stood by the counters andSam was reminded of Saturday nights in Caxton.</p><p> The two women, Edith and Janet Eberly, met through Jack Prince, to one ofwhom Sam had sent the roses at the hands of the other, and from whom hehad borrowed the six thousand dollars when he was new in the city, hadbeen in Chicago for five years when Sam came to know them. For all of thefive years they had lived in a two-story frame building that had been aresidence in Wabash Avenue near Thirty-ninth Street and that was now botha residence and a grocery store. The apartment upstairs, reached by astairway at the side of the grocery, had in the five years, and under thehand of Janet Eberly, become a thing of beauty, perfect in the simplicityand completeness of its appointment.</p><p> The two women were the daughters of a farmer who had lived in one of themiddle western states facing the Mississippi River. Their grandfather hadbeen a noted man in the state, having been one of its first governors andlater serving it in the senate in Washington. There was a county and agood-sized town named for him and he had once been talked of as a vicepresidential possibility but had died at Washington before the conventionat which his name was to have been put forward. His one son, a youth ofgreat promise, went to West Point and served brilliantly through the CivilWar, afterward commanding several western army posts and marrying thedaughter of another army man. His wife, an army belle, died after havingborne him the two daughters.</p><p> After the death of his wife Major Eberly began drinking, and to get awayfrom the habit and from the army atmosphere where he had lived with hiswife, whom he loved intensely, took the two little girls and returned tohis home state to settle on a farm.</p><p> About the county where the two girls grew to womanhood, their father,Major Eberly, got the name of a character, seeing people but seldom andtreating rudely the friendly advances of his farmer neighbours. He wouldsit in the house for days poring over books, of which he had a great many,and hundreds of which were now on open shelves in the apartment of the twogirls. These days of study, during which he would brook no intrusion, werefollowed by days of fierce industry during which he led team after team tothe field, ploughing or reaping day and night with no rest except to eat.</p><p> At the edge of the Eberly farm there was a little wooden country churchsurrounded by a hay field, and on Sunday mornings during the summer theex-army man was always to be found in the field, running some noisy,clattering agricultural implement up and down under the windows of thechurch and disturbing the worship of the country folk; in the winter hedrew a pile of logs there and went on Sunday mornings to split firewoodunder the church windows. While his daughters were small he was severaltimes haled into court and fined for cruel neglect of his animals. Once helocked a great herd of fine sheep in a shed and went into the house andstayed for days intent upon his books so that many of them sufferedcruelly for want of food and water. When he was taken into court andfined, half the county came to the trial and gloated over his humiliation.</p><p> To the two girls the father was neither cruel nor kind, leaving themlargely to themselves but giving them no money, so that they went about indresses made over from those of the mother, that lay piled in trunks inthe attic. When they were small, an old Negro woman, an ex-servant of thearmy belle, lived with and mothered them, but when Edith was a girl of tenthis woman went off home to Tennessee, so that the girls were thrown ontheir own resources and ran the house in their own way.</p><p> Janet Eberly was, at the beginning of her friendship with Sam, a slightwoman of twenty-seven with a small expressive face, quick nervous fingers,black piercing eyes, black hair and a way of becoming so absorbed in theexposition of a book or the rush of a conversation that her little intenseface became transfigured and her quick fingers clutched the arm of herlistener while her eyes looked into his and she lost all consciousness ofhis presence or of the opinions he may have expressed. She was a cripple,having fallen from the loft of a barn in her youth injuring her back sothat she sat all day in a specially made reclining wheeled chair.</p><p> Edith was a stenographer, working in the office of a publisher down town,and Janet trimmed hats for a milliner a few doors down the street from thehouse in which they lived. In his will the father left the money from thesale of the farm to Janet, and Sam used it, insuring his life for tenthousand dollars in her name while it was in his possession and handlingit with a caution entirely absent from his operations with the money ofthe medical student. "Take it and make money for me," the little woman hadsaid impulsively one evening shortly after the beginning of theiracquaintance and after Jack Prince had been talking flamboyantly of Sam'sability in affairs. "What is the good of having a talent if you do not useit to benefit those who haven't it?"</p><p> Janet Eberly was an intellect. She disregarded all the usual womanlypoints of view and had an attitude of her own toward life and people. In away she had understood her hard-driven, grey-haired father and during thetime of her great physical suffering they had built up a kind ofunderstanding and affection for each other. After his death she wore aminiature of him, made in his boyhood, on a chain about her neck. When Sammet her the two immediately became close friends, sitting for hours intalk and coming to look forward with great pleasure to the evenings spenttogether.</p><p> In the Eberly household Sam McPherson was a benefactor, a wonder-worker.In his hands the six thousand dollars was bringing two thousand a yearinto the house and adding immeasurably to the air of comfort and goodliving that prevailed there. To Janet, who managed the house, he wasguide, counsellor, and something more than friend.</p><p> Of the two women it was the strong, vigorous Edith, with the reddish-brownhair and the air of physical completeness that made men stop to look ather on the street, who first became Sam's friend.</p><p> Edith Eberly was strong of body, given to quick flashes of anger, stupidintellectually and hungry to the roots of her for wealth and a place inthe world. She had heard, through Jack Prince, of Sam's money making andof his ability and prospects and, for a time, had designs upon hisaffections. Several times when they were alone together she gave his handa characteristically impulsive squeeze and once upon the stairway besidethe grocery store offered him her lips to kiss. Later there sprang upbetween her and Jack Prince a passionate love affair, dropped finally byPrince through fear of her violent fits of anger. After Sam had met JanetEberly and had become her loyal friend and henchman all show of affectionor even of interest between him and Edith was at an end and the kiss uponthe stairs was forgotten.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> Going up the stairway after the ride in the cable car Sam stood besideJanet's wheel chair in the room at the front of the apartment facingWabash Avenue. The chair was by the window and faced an open coal fire ina grate she had had built into the wall of the house. Outside, through anopen arched doorway, Edith moved noiselessly about taking dishes from alittle table. He knew that after a time Jack Prince would come and takeher to the theatre, leaving Janet and him to finish their talk.</p><p> Sam lighted his pipe and between puffs began talking, making a statementthat he knew would arouse her, and Janet, putting her hand impulsively onhis shoulder, began tearing the statement to bits.</p><p> "You talk!" she broke out. "Books are not full of pretence and lies; youbusiness men are--you and Jack Prince. What do you know of books? They arethe most wonderful things in the world. Men sit writing them and forget tolie, but you business men never forget. You and books! You haven't readbooks, not real ones. Didn't my father know; didn't he save himself frominsanity through books? Do I not, sitting here, get the real feel of themovement of the world through the books that men write? Suppose I sawthose men. They would swagger and strut and take themselves seriously justlike you or Jack or the grocer down stairs. You think you know what'sgoing on in the world. You think you are doing things, you Chicago men ofmoney and action and growth. You are blind, all blind."</p><p> The little woman, a light, half scorn, half amusement in her eyes, leanedforward and ran her fingers through Sam's hair, laughing down into theastonished face he turned up to her.</p><p> "Oh, I'm not afraid, in spite of what Edith and Jack Prince say of you,"she went on impulsively. "I like you all right and if I were a well womanI should make love to you and marry you and then see to it there wassomething in this world for you besides money and tall buildings and menand machines that make guns."</p><p> Sam grinned. "You are like your father, driving the mowing machine up anddown under the church windows on Sunday mornings," he declared; "you thinkyou could remake the world by shaking your fist at it. I should like to goand see you fined in a court room for starving sheep."</p><p> Janet, closing her eyes and lying back in her chair, laughed with delightand declared that they would have a splendid quarrelsome evening.</p><p> After Edith had gone out, Sam sat through the evening with Janet,listening to her exposition of life and what she thought it should mean toa strong capable fellow like himself, as he had been listening ever sincetheir acquaintanceship began. In the talk, and in the many talks they hadhad together, talks that rang in his ears for years, the little black-eyedwoman gave him a glimpse into a whole purposeful universe of thought andaction of which he had never dreamed, introducing him to a new world ofmen: methodical, hard-thinking Germans, emotional, dreaming Russians,analytical, courageous Norwegians, Spaniards and Italians with their senseof beauty, and blundering, hopeful Englishmen wanting so much and gettingso little; so that at the end of the evening he went out of her presencefeeling strangely small and insignificant against the great worldbackground she had drawn for him.</p><p> Sam did not understand Janet's point of view. It was all too new andforeign to everything life had taught him, and in his mind he fought herideas doggedly, clinging to his own concrete, practical thoughts andhopes, but on the train homeward bound, and in his own room later, heturned over and over in his mind the things she had said and tried in adim way to grasp the bigness of the conception of human life she had gotsitting in a wheel chair and looking down into Wabash Avenue.</p><p> Sam loved Janet Eberly. No word of that had ever passed between them andhe had seen her hand flash out and grasp the shoulder of Jack Prince whenshe was laying down to him some law of life as she saw it, as it had sooften shot out and grasped his own, but had she been able to spring out ofthe wheel chair he should have taken her hand and gone with her to theclergyman within the hour and in his heart he knew that she would havegone with him gladly.</p><p> Janet died suddenly during the second year of Sam's work for the guncompany without a direct declaration of affection from him, but during theyears when they were much together he thought of her as in a sense hiswife and when she died he was desolate, overdrinking night after night andwandering aimlessly through the deserted streets during hours when heshould have been asleep. She was the first woman who ever got hold of andstirred his manhood, and she awoke something in him that made it possiblefor him later to see life with a broadness and scope of vision that was nopart of the pushing, energetic young man of dollars and of industry whosat beside her wheeled chair during the evenings on Wabash Avenue.</p><p> After Janet's death, Sam did not continue his friendship with Edith, butturned over to her the ten thousand dollars to which the six thousand ofJanet's money had grown in his hands and did not see her again.</p><h2>Book II - Chapter 4</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> One night in April Colonel Tom Rainey of the great Rainey Arms Company andhis chief lieutenant, young Sam McPherson, treasurer and chairman of theboard of directors of the company, slept together in a room in a St. Paulhotel. It was a double room with two beds, and Sam, lying on his pillow,looked across the bed to where the colonel's paunch protruding itselfbetween him and the light from a long narrow window, made a round hillabove which the moon just peeped. During the evening the two men had satfor several hours at a table in the grill down stairs while Sam discusseda proposition he proposed making to a St. Paul jobber the next day. Theaccount of the jobber, a large one, had been threatened by Lewis, the Jewmanager of the Edwards Arms Company, the Rainey Company's only importantwestern rival, and Sam was full of ideas to checkmate the shrewd trademove the Jew had made. At the table, the colonel had been silent andtaciturn, an unusual attitude of mind for him, and Sam lay in bed andlooked at the moon gradually working its way over the undulating abdominalhill, wondering what was in his mind. The hill dropped, showing the fullface of the moon, and then rose again obliterating it.</p><p> "Sam, were you ever in love?" asked the colonel, with a sigh.</p><p> Sam turned and buried his face in the pillow and the white covering of hisbed danced up and down. "The old fool, has it come to that with him?" heasked himself. "After all these years of single life is he going to beginrunning after women now?"</p><p> He did not answer the colonel's question. "There are breakers ahead foryou, old boy," he thought, the figure of quiet, determined, little SueRainey, the colonel's daughter, as he had seen her on the rare occasionswhen he had dined at the Rainey home or she had come into the LaSalleStreet offices, coming into his mind. With a quiver of enjoyment of themental exercise, he tried to imagine the colonel as a swaggering bladeamong women.</p><p> The colonel, oblivious of Sam's mirth and of his silence regarding hisexperience in the field of love, began talking, making amends for thesilence in the grill. He told Sam that he had decided to take to himself anew wife, and confessed that the view of the matter his daughter mighttake worried him. "Children are so unfair," he complained; "they forgetabout a man's feelings and can't realise that his heart is still young."</p><p> With a smile on his lips, Sam began trying to picture a woman's lying inhis place and looking at the moon over the pulsating hill. The colonelcontinued talking. He grew franker, telling the name of his beloved andthe circumstances of their meeting and courtship. "She is an actress, aworking girl," he said feelingly. "I met her at a dinner given by WillSperry one evening and she was the only woman there who did not drinkwine. After the dinner we went for a drive together and she told me of herhard life, of her fight against temptations, and of her brother, anartist, she is trying to get started in the world. We have been together adozen times and have written letters, and, Sam, we have discovered anaffinity for each other."</p><p> Sam sat up in bed. "Letters!" he muttered. "The old dog is going to gethimself involved." He dropped again upon the pillow. "Well, let him. Whyneed I bother myself?"</p><p> The colonel, having begun talking, could not stop. "Although we have seeneach other only a dozen times, a letter has passed between us every day.Oh, if you could see the letters she writes. They are wonderful."</p><p> A worried sigh broke from the colonel. "I want Sue to invite her to thehouse, but I am afraid," he complained; "I am afraid she will be wrongheaded about it. Women are such determined creatures. She and my Luellashould meet and know each other, but if I go home and tell her she maymake a scene and hurt Luella's feelings."</p><p> The moon had risen, shedding its light in Sam's eyes, and he turned hisback to the colonel and prepared to sleep. The naive credulity of theolder man had touched a spring of mirth in him and from time to time thecovering of his bed continued to quiver suggestively.</p><p> "I would not hurt her feelings for anything. She is the squarest littlewoman alive," the voice of the colonel announced. The voice broke and thecolonel, who habitually roared forth his sentiments, began to dither. Samwondered if his feelings had been touched by the thoughts of his daughteror of the lady from the stage. "It is a wonderful thing," half sobbed thecolonel, "when a young and beautiful woman gives her whole heart into thekeeping of a man like me."</p><p> It was a week later before Sam heard more of the affair. Looking up fromhis desk in the offices in LaSalle Street one morning, he found Sue Raineystanding before him. She was a small athletic looking woman with blackhair, square shoulders, cheeks browned by the sun and wind, and quiet greyeyes. She stood facing Sam's desk and pulled off a glove while she lookeddown at him with amused, quizzical eyes. Sam rose, and leaning over theflat-topped desk, took her hand, wondering what had brought her there.</p><p> Sue Rainey did not mince matters, but plunged at once into an explanationof the purpose of her visit. From birth she had lived in an atmosphere ofwealth. Although she was not counted a beautiful woman, she had, becauseof her wealth and the charm of her person, been much courted. Sam, who hadtalked briefly with her a half dozen times, had long had a hauntingcuriosity to know more of her personality. As she stood there before himlooking so wonderfully well-kept and confident he thought her baffling andpuzzling.</p><p> "The colonel," she began, and then hesitated and smiled. "You, Mr.McPherson, have become a figure in my father's life. He depends upon youvery much. He tells me that he has talked with you concerning a MissLuella London from the theatre, and that you have agreed with him that thecolonel and she should marry."</p><p> Sam watched her gravely. A flicker of mirth ran through him, but his facewas grave and disinterested.</p><p> "Yes?" he said, looking into her eyes. "Have you met Miss London?"</p><p> "I have," answered Sue Rainey. "Have you?"</p><p> Sam shook his head.</p><p> "She is impossible," declared the colonel's daughter, clutching the gloveheld in her hand and staring at the floor. A flush of anger rose in hercheeks. "She is a crude, hard, scheming woman. She colours her hair, shecries when you look at her, she hasn't even the grace to be ashamed ofwhat she is trying to do, and she has got the colonel into a fix."</p><p> Sam looked at the brown of Sue Rainey's cheek and thought the texture ofit beautiful. He wondered why he had heard her called a plain woman. Theheightened colour brought to her face by her anger had, he thought,transfigured her. He liked her direct, forceful way of putting the matterof the colonel's affair, and felt keenly the compliment implied by herhaving come to him. "She has self-respect," he told himself, and felt athrill of pride in her attitude as though it had been inspired by himself.</p><p> "I have been hearing of you a great deal," she continued, glancing up athim and smiling. "At our house you are brought to the table with the soupand taken away with the liqueur. My father interlards his table talk, andintroduces all of his wise new axioms on economy and efficiency andgrowth, with a constant procession of 'Sam says' and 'Sam thinks.' And themen who come to the house talk of you also. Teddy Foreman says that atdirectors' meetings they all sit about like children waiting for you totell them what to do."</p><p> She threw out her hand with an impatient little gesture. "I am in a hole,"she said. "I might handle my father but I cannot handle that woman."</p><p> While she had been talking to him Sam looked past her and out at a window.When her eyes wandered from his face he looked again at her brown firmcheeks. From the beginning of the interview he had been intending to helpher.</p><p> "Give me the lady's address," he said; "I'll go look her over."</p><p> Three evenings later Sam took Miss Luella London to a midnight supper atone of the town's best restaurants. She knew the motive of his taking her,as he had been quite frank in the few minutes' talk near the stage door ofthe theatre when the engagement was made. As they ate, they talked of theplays at the Chicago theatres, and Sam told her a story of an amateurperformance that had once taken place in the hall over Geiger's drug storein Caxton when he was boy. In the performance Sam had taken the rle of adrummer boy killed on the field of battle by a swaggering villain in agrey uniform, and John Telfer, in the rle of villain, had become so inearnest that, a pistol not exploding at a critical moment, he had chasedSam about the stage trying to hit him with the butt of the weapon whilethe audience roared with delight at the realism of Telfer's rage and atthe frightened boy begging for mercy.</p><p> Luella London laughed heartily at Sam's story and then, the coffee beingserved, she fingered the handle of the cup and a shrewd look came into hereyes.</p><p> "And now you are a big business man and have come to see me about ColonelRainey," she said.</p><p> Sam lighted a cigar.</p><p> "Just how much are you counting on this marriage between yourself and thecolonel?" he asked bluntly.</p><p> The actress laughed and poured cream into her coffee. A line came and wenton her forehead between her eyes. Sam thought she looked capable.</p><p> "I have been thinking of what you told me at the stage door," she said,and a childlike smile played about her lips. "Do you know, Mr. McPherson,I can't just figure you. I can't just see how you get into this. Where areyour credentials, anyway?"</p><p> Sam, keeping his eyes upon her face, took a jump into the dark.</p><p> "It's this way," he said, "I'm something of an adventurer myself. I flythe black flag. I come from where you do. I had to reach out my hand andtake what I wanted. I do not blame you in the least, but it just happensthat I saw Colonel Tom Rainey first. He is my game and I do not propose tohave you fooling around. I am not bluffing. You have got to get off him."</p><p> Leaning forward, he stared at her intently, and then lowered his voice."I've got your record. I know the man you used to live with. He's going tohelp me get you if you do not drop it."</p><p> Sitting back in his chair Sam watched her gravely. He had taken the oddchance to win quickly by a bluff and had won. But Luella London was not tobe defeated without a struggle.</p><p> "You lie," she cried, half springing from her chair. "Frank has never--"</p><p> "Oh yes, Frank has," answered Sam, turning as though to call a waiter; "Iwill have him here in ten minutes if you wish to be shown."</p><p> Picking up a fork the woman began nervously picking holes in the tablecloth and a tear appeared upon her cheek. She took a handkerchief from abag that hung hooked over the back of a chair at the side of the table andwiped her eyes.</p><p> "All right! All right!" she said, bracing herself, "I'll drop it. Ifyou've dug up Frank Robson you've got me. He'll do anything you say for apiece of money."</p><p> For some minutes the two sat in silence. A tired look had come into thewoman's eyes.</p><p> "I wish I was a man," she said. "I get whipped at everything I tacklebecause I'm a woman. I'm getting past my money-making days in the theatreand I thought the colonel was fair game."</p><p> "He is," answered Sam dispassionately, "but you see I beat you to it. He'smine."</p><p> Glancing cautiously about the room, he took a roll of bills from hispocket and began laying them one at a time upon the table.</p><p> "Look here," he said, "you've done a good piece of work. You should havewon. For ten years half the society women of Chicago have been trying tomarry their daughters or their sons to the Rainey fortune. They hadeverything to help them, wealth, good looks, and a standing in the world.You have none of these things. How did you do it?</p><p> "Anyway," he went on, "I'm not going to see you trimmed. I've got tenthousand dollars here, as good Rainey money as ever was printed. You signthis paper and then put the roll in your purse."</p><p> "That's square," said Luella London, signing, and with the light comingback into her eyes.</p><p> Sam beckoned to the proprietor of the restaurant whom he knew and had himand a waiter sign as witnesses.</p><p> Luella London put the roll of bills into her purse.</p><p> "What did you give me that money for when you had me beat anyway?" sheasked.</p><p> Sam lighted a fresh cigar and folding the paper put it in his pocket.</p><p> "Because I like you and I admire your skill," he said, "and anyway I didnot have you beaten until right now."</p><p> They sat studying the people getting up from the tables and going throughthe door to waiting carriages and automobiles, the well-dressed women withassured airs serving Sam's mind to make a contrast for the woman who satwith him.</p><p> "I presume you are right about women," he said musingly, "it must be astiff game for you if you like winning on your own hook."</p><p> "Winning! We don't win." The lips of the actress drew back showing herwhite teeth. "No woman ever won who tried to play a straight fighting gamefor herself."</p><p> Her voice grew tense and the lines upon her forehead reappeared.</p><p> "Woman can't stand alone," she went on, "she is a sentimental fool. Shereaches out her hand to some man and that in the end beats her. Why, evenwhen she plays the game as I played it against the colonel some rat of aman like Frank Robson, for whom she has given up everything worth while toa woman, sells her out."</p><p> Sam looked at her hand, covered with rings, lying on the table.</p><p> "Let's not misunderstand each other," he said quietly, "do not blame Frankfor this. I never knew him. I just imagined him."</p><p> A puzzled look came into the woman's eyes and a flush rose in her cheeks.</p><p> "You grafter!" she sneered.</p><p> Sam called to a passing waiter and ordered a fresh bottle of wine.</p><p> "What's the use being sore?" he asked. "It's simple enough. You stakedagainst a better mind. Anyway you have the ten thousand, haven't you?"</p><p> Luella reached for her purse.</p><p> "I don't know," she said, "I'll look. Haven't you decided to steal it backyet?"</p><p> Sam laughed.</p><p> "I'm coming to that," he said, "don't hurry me."</p><p> For several minutes they sat eyeing each other, and then, with an earnestring in his voice and a smile on his lips, Sam began talking again.</p><p> "Look here!" he said, "I'm no Frank Robson and I do not like giving awoman the worst of it. I have been studying you and I can't see yourunning around loose with ten thousand dollars of real money on you. Youdo not fit into the picture and the money will not last a year in yourhands.</p><p> "Give it to me," he urged; "let me invest it for you. I'm a winner. I'lldouble it for you in a year."</p><p> The actress stared past Sam's shoulder to where a group of young men satabout a table drinking and talking loudly. Sam began telling an anecdoteof an Irish baggage man in Caxton. When he had finished he looked at herand laughed.</p><p> "As that shoemaker looked to Jerry Donlin so you, as the colonel's wife,looked to me," he said. "I had to make you get out of my flower bed."</p><p> A gleam of resolution came into the wandering eyes of Luella London andshe took the purse from the back of the chair and brought out the roll ofbills.</p><p> "I'm a sport," she said, "and I'm going to lay a bet on the best horse Iever saw. You may trim me, but I always would take a chance."</p><p> Turning, she called a waiter and, handing him a bill from her purse, threwthe roll on the table.</p><p> "Take the pay for the spread and the wine we have had out of that," shesaid, handing him the loose bill and then turning to Sam. "You ought tobeat the world. Anyway your genius gets recognition from me. I pay forthis party and when you see the colonel say good-bye to him for me."</p><p> The next day, at his request, Sue Rainey called at the offices of the ArmsCompany and Sam handed her the paper signed by Luella London. It was anagreement on her part to divide with Sam, half and half, any money shemight be able to blackmail out of Colonel Rainey.</p><p> The colonel's daughter glanced from the paper to Sam's face.</p><p> "I thought so," she said, and a puzzled look came into her eyes. "But I donot understand this. What does this paper do and what did you pay for it?"</p><p> "The paper," Sam answered, "puts her in a hole and I paid ten thousanddollars for it."</p><p> Sue Rainey laughed and taking a checkbook from her handbag laid it on thedesk and sat down.</p><p> "Do you get your half?" she asked.</p><p> "I get it all," answered Sam, and then leaning back in his chair launchedinto an explanation. When he had told her of the talk in the restaurantshe sat with the checkbook lying before her and with the puzzled lookstill in her eyes.</p><p> Without giving her time for comment, Sam plunged into the midst of whathad been in his mind to say to her.</p><p> "The woman will not bother the colonel any more," he declared; "if thatpaper won't hold her something else will. She respects me and she isafraid of me. We had a talk after she had signed the paper and she gave methe ten thousand dollars to invest for her. I promised to double it forher within a year and I want to make good. I want you to double it now.Make the check for twenty thousand."</p><p> Sue Rainey wrote the check, making it payable to bearer, and pushed itacross the table.</p><p> "I cannot say that I understand yet," she confessed. "Did you also fall inlove with her?"</p><p> Sam grinned. He was wondering whether he would be able to get into wordsjust what he wanted to tell her of the actress soldier of fortune. Helooked across the table at her frank grey eyes and then on an impulsedecided that he would tell it straight out as though she had been a man.</p><p> "It's like this," he said. "I like ability and good brains and that womanhas them. She isn't a good woman, but nothing in her life has made herwant to be good. All her life she has been going the wrong way, and nowshe wants to get on her feet and squared around. That's what she was afterthe colonel for. She did not want to marry him, she wanted to make himgive her the start she was after. I got the best of her because somewherethere is a snivelling little whelp of a man who has taken all the good andthe fineness out of her and who now stands ready to sell her out for a fewdollars. I imagined there would be such a man when I saw her and I bluffedmy way through to him. But I do not want to whip a woman, even in such anaffair, through the cheapness of some man. I want to do the square thingby her. That's why I asked you to make that check for twenty thousand."</p><p> Sue Rainey rose and stood by the desk looking down at him. He was thinkinghow wonderfully clear and honest her eyes.</p><p> "And what about the colonel?" she asked. "What will he think of all this?"</p><p> Sam walked around the desk and took her hand.</p><p> "We'll have to agree not to consider him," he said. "We really did thatyou know when we started this thing. I think we can depend upon MissLondon's putting the finishing touches on the job."</p><p> And Miss London did. She sent for Sam a week later and put tweny-fivehundred dollars into his hand.</p><p> "That's not to invest for me," she said, "that's for yourself. By theagreement I signed with you we were to split anything I got out of thecolonel. Well, I went light. I only got five thousand dollars."</p><p> With the money in his hand Sam stood by the side of a little table in herroom looking at her.</p><p> "What did you tell the colonel?" he asked.</p><p> "I called him up here to my room last night and lying here in bed I toldhim that I had just discovered I was the victim of an incurable disease. Itold him that within a month I would be in bed for keeps and asked him tomarry me at once and to take me away with him to some quiet place where Icould die in his arms."</p><p> Coming over to Sam, Luella London put a hand upon his arm and laughed.</p><p> "He began to beg off and make excuses," she went on, "and then I broughtout his letters to me and talked straight. He wilted at once and paid thefive thousand dollars I asked for the letters without a murmur. I mighthave made it fifty and with your talent you ought to get all he has in sixmonths."</p><p> Sam shook hands with her and told her of his success in doubling the moneyshe had put into his hands. Then putting the twenty-five hundred dollarsin his pocket he went back to his desk. He did not see her again and when,through a lucky market turn, he had increased the twenty thousand dollarsshe had left with him to twenty-five, he placed it in the hands of a trustcompany for her and forgot the incident. Years later he heard that she wasrunning a fashionable dressmaking establishment in a western city.</p><p> And Colonel Tom Rainey, who had for months talked of nothing but factoryefficiency and of what he and young Sam McPherson were going to do in theway of enlarging the business, began the next morning a tirade againstwomen that lasted the rest of his life.</p><h2>Book II - Chapter 5</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sue Rainey had long touched the fancy of the youths of Chicago societywho, while looking at her trim little figure and at the respectable sizeof the fortune behind it, were yet puzzled and disconcerted by herattitude toward themselves. On the wide porches at golf clubs, where youngmen in white trousers lounged and smoked cigarettes, and in the down-townclubs, where the same young men spent winter afternoons playing Kellypool, they spoke of her, calling her an enigma. "She'll end by being anold maid," they declared, and shook their heads at the thought of so gooda connection dangling loosely in the air just without their reach. Fromtime to time, one of the young men tore himself loose from the group thatcontemplated her, and, with an opening volley of books, candy, flowers andinvitations to theatres, charged down upon her, only to have the youthfulardour of his attack cooled by her prolonged attitude of indifference.When she was twenty-one, a young English cavalry officer, who came toChicago to ride in the horse show had, for some weeks, been seen much inher company and a report of their engagement had been whispered throughthe town and talked of about the nineteenth hole at the country clubs. Therumour proved to be without foundation, the attraction to the cavalryofficer having been a certain brand of rare old wine the colonel hadstored in his cellar and a feeling of brotherhood with the swaggering oldgun maker, rather than the colonel's quiet little daughter.</p><p> After the beginning of his acquaintanceship with her, and all during thedays when he stirred things up in the offices and shops of the guncompany, tales of the assiduous and often needy young men who were campedon her trail reached Sam's ears. They would be in at the office to see andtalk with the colonel, who had several times confided to Sam that hisdaughter Sue was already past the age at which right-minded young womenshould marry, and in the absence of the father two or three of them hadformed a habit of stopping for a word with Sam, whom they had met throughthe colonel or Jack Prince. They declared that they were "squaringthemselves with the colonel." Not a difficult thing to do, Sam thought, ashe drank the wine, smoked the cigars, and ate the dinners of all withoutprejudice. Once, at luncheon, Colonel Tom discussed these young men withSam, pounding on a table so that the glasses jumped about, and callingthem damned upstarts.</p><p> For his own part, Sam did not feel that he knew Sue Rainey, and although,after their first meeting one evening at the Rainey house, he had beenpricked by a mild curiosity concerning her, no opportunity to satisfy ithad presented itself. He knew that she was athletic, travelled much, rode,shot, and sailed a boat; and he had heard Jack Prince speak of her as awoman of brains, but, until the incident of the colonel and Luella Londonthrew them for the moment into the same enterprise and started himthinking of her with real interest, he had seen and talked with her forbut brief passing moments brought about by their mutual interest in theaffairs of her father.</p><p> After Janet Eberly's sudden death, and while he was yet in the midst ofhis grief at her loss, Sam had his first long talk with Sue Rainey. It wasin Colonel Tom's office, and Sam, walking hurriedly in, found her sittingat the colonel's desk and staring out of the window at a broad expanse offlat roofs. A man, climbing a flag pole to replace a slipped rope, caughthis attention and standing by the window looking at the minute figureclinging to the swaying pole, he began talking of the absurdity of humanendeavour.</p><p> The colonel's daughter listened respectfully to his rather obviousbanalities and getting up from her chair came to stand beside him. Samturned slyly to look at her firm brown cheeks as he had looked on themorning when she had come to see him about Luella London and was struck bythe thought that she in some faint way reminded him of Janet Eberly. In amoment, and rather to his own surprise, he burst into a long speechtelling of Janet, of the tragedy of her loss and something of the beautyof her life and character.</p><p> The nearness of his loss and the nearness also of what he thought might bea sympathetic listener spurred him and he found himself getting a kind ofrelief for the aching sense of loss for his dead comrade by heapingpraises upon her life.</p><p> When he had finished saying what was in his mind, he stood by the windowfeeling awkward and embarrassed. The man who climbed the flag pole havingput the rope through the ring at the top slid suddenly down the pole andthinking for the moment that he had fallen Sam made a quick clutch at theair with his hand. His gripping fingers closed over Sue Rainey's hand.</p><p> He turned, amused by the incident, and began making a halting explanation.There were tears in Sue Rainey's eyes.</p><p> "I wish I had known her," she said and drew her hand from between hisfingers. "I wish you had known me better that I also might have known yourJanet. They are rare--such women. They are worth much to know. Most womenlike most men--"</p><p> She made an impatient gesture with her hand and Sam, turning, walkedtoward the door. He felt that he might not trust himself to answer her.For the first time since coming to manhood he felt that tears might at anymoment come into his eyes. Grief for the loss of Janet surged through himdisconcerting and engulfing him.</p><p> "I have been doing you an injustice," said Sue Rainey, looking at thefloor. "I have thought of you as something different from what you are.There is a story I heard of you which gave me a wrong impression."</p><p> Sam smiled. Having conquered the commotion within himself, he laughed andexplained the incident of the man who had slid down the pole.</p><p> "What was the story you heard?" he asked.</p><p> "It was a story a young man told at our house," she explainedhesitatingly, refusing to be carried away from her mood of seriousness."It was about a little girl you saved from drowning and a purse made upand given you. Why did you take the money?"</p><p> Sam looked at her squarely. The story was one that Jack Prince had delightin telling. It concerned an incident of his early business life in thecity.</p><p> One afternoon, when he was still in the employ of the commission firm, hehad taken a party of men for a trip on an excursion steamer on the lake.He had a project into which he wanted them to go with him and had takenthem aboard the steamer to get them together and present the merits of hisscheme. During the trip a little girl had fallen overboard and Sam,springing after her, had brought her safely aboard the boat.</p><p> On the excursion steamer a cheer had arisen. A young man in a broadbrimmed cowboy hat ran about taking up a collection. People crowdedforward to grasp Sam's hand and he had accepted the money collected andhad put it in his pocket.</p><p> Among the men aboard the boat were several who, while they did not drawback from going into Sam's project, had thought his taking the money notmanly. They had told the story, and it had come to the ears of JackPrince, who never tired of repeating it and always ended the story withthe request that the listener ask Sam why he had taken the money.</p><p> Now in Colonel Tom's office facing Sue Rainey, Sam made the explanationthat had so delighted Jack Prince.</p><p> "The crowd wanted to give me the money," he said, slightly perplexed. "Whyshouldn't I have taken it? I did not save the little girl for the money,but because she was a little girl; and the money paid for my ruinedclothes and the expenses of the trip."</p><p> With his hand on the doorknob he looked steadily at the woman before him.</p><p> "And I wanted the money," he announced, a ring of defiance in his voice."I have always wanted money, any money I could get."</p><p> Sam went back to his own office and sat down at his desk. He had beensurprised by the cordiality and friendliness Sue Rainey had shown towardhim. On an impulse, he wrote a letter, defending his position in thematter of the money taken on the excursion steamer and setting forthsomething of the attitude of his mind toward money and business affairs.</p><p> "I cannot see myself believing in the rot most business men talk," hewrote at the end of the letter. "They are full of sentiment and idealswhich are not true. Having a thing to sell they always say it is the best,although it may be third rate. I do not object to that. What I do objectto is the way they have of nursing a hope within themselves that the thirdrate thing is first rate until the hope becomes a belief. In the talk Ihad with that actress Luella London I told her that I myself flew theblack flag. Well, I do. I would lie about goods to sell them, but I wouldnot lie to myself. I will not stultify my own mind. If a man crossesswords with me in a business deal and I come out of the affair with themoney, it is no sign that I am the greater rascal, rather it is a signthat I am the keener man."</p><p> With the note lying before him on the desk Sam wondered why he had writtenit. It seemed to him an accurate and straightforward statement of thebusiness creed he had adopted for himself, but a rather absurd note towrite to a woman. And then, not allowing himself time to reconsider hisaction, he addressed an envelope and going out into the general officesdropped it into the mail chute.</p><p> "It will let her know where I stand anyway," he thought, with a return ofthe defiant mood in which he had told her the motive of his action on theboat.</p><p> Within the next ten days after the talk in Colonel Tom's office Sam sawSue Rainey several times coming to or going from her father's office.Once, meeting in the little lobby by the office entrance, she stopped andput out her hand which Sam took awkwardly. He had a feeling that she wouldnot have regretted an opportunity to continue the sudden little intimacythat had sprung up between them in the few minutes' talk of Janet Eberly.The feeling did not come from vanity but from a belief in Sam that she wasin some way lonely and wanting companionship. Although she had been muchcourted she lacked, he thought, the talent for comradeship or quickfriendliness. "Like Janet she is more than half intellect," he toldhimself, and felt a pang of regret for the slight disloyalty of thefurther thought that there was in Sue a something more substantial andsolid than there had been in Janet.</p><p> Suddenly Sam began wondering whether or not he would like to marry SueRainey. His mind played with the idea. He took it with him to bed, and itwent with him all day in his hurried trips through offices and shops. Thethought having come to him persisted, and he began seeing her in a newlight. The odd half awkward little movements of her hands, and theirexpressiveness, the brown fine texture of her cheeks, the clearness andhonesty of her grey eyes, the quick sympathy and understanding of hisfeeling for Janet, and the subtle flattery of the notion he had got thatshe was interested in him--all of these things came and went in his mindwhile he ran through columns of figures and laid plans for the expansionof the business of the Arms Company. Unconsciously he began to make her apart of his plans for the future.</p><p> Later, Sam discovered that during the days after the first talk togetherthe thought of a marriage between them was in Sue's mind also. After thetalk she went home and stood for an hour before the glass studying herselfand she once told Sam that in her bed that night she shed tears becauseshe had never been able to arouse in a man the note of tenderness that hadbeen in his voice when he talked to her of Janet.</p><p> And then two months after the first talk they had another. Sam, who hadnot allowed his grief over the loss of Janet or his nightly efforts todrown the sting of it in hard drinking, to check the big forward movementthat he felt he was getting into the work of the offices and shops, satone afternoon deeply absorbed in a pile of factory cost sheets. His shirtsleeves were rolled to the elbow, showing his white muscular forearms. Hewas absorbed, intent upon the sheets.</p><p> "I stepped in," said a voice above his head.</p><p> Glancing up quickly, Sam sprang to his feet. "She must have been theresome minutes looking down at me," he thought, and had a thrill of pleasurein the thought.</p><p> Into his mind came the contents of the letter he had written her, and hewondered if after all he had been a fool, and whether the thoughts of amarriage with her were but vagaries. "Perhaps it would not be attractiveto either her or myself when we came up to it," he decided.</p><p> "I stepped in," she began again. "I have been thinking. Some things yousaid--in the letter and when you talked of your friend Janet who died-some things of men and women and work. You may not remember them. I--I gotinterested. I--are you a socialist?"</p><p> "I believe not," Sam answered, wondering what had given her that thought."Are you?"</p><p> She laughed and shook her head.</p><p> "Just what are you?" she went on. "What do you believe? I am curious toknow. I thought your note--you will pardon me--I thought it a kind ofpretence."</p><p> Sam winced. A shadow of doubt of the sincerity of his business philosophycrossed his mind accompanied by the swaggering figure of Windy McPherson.He came around the desk and leaning against it looked at her. Hissecretary had gone out of the room and they were alone together. Samlaughed.</p><p> "There was a man in the town where I was raised used to say that I was alittle mole working underground, intent upon worms," he said, and then,waving his arms toward the papers on the desk, added, "I am a businessman. Isn't that enough? If you could go with me through some of these costsheets you would agree they are needed."</p><p> He turned and faced her again.</p><p> "What should I be doing with beliefs?" he asked.</p><p> "Well, I think you have them--some kind of beliefs," she insisted, "youmust have them. You get things done. You should hear the men talk of you.Sometimes at the house they are quite foolish about what a wonderfulfellow you are and what you are doing here. They say that you drive on andon. What drives you? I want to know."</p><p> For the moment Sam half suspected that she was secretly laughing at him.Finding her quite serious he started to reply and then stopped, regardingher.</p><p> The silence between them went on and on. A clock on the wall tickedloudly.</p><p> Sam stepped nearer to her and stood looking down into the face she slowlyturned up to his.</p><p> "I want to have a talk with you," he said, and his voice broke. He had theillusion of a hand gripping at his throat.</p><p> In a flash he had definitely decided that he would try to marry her. Herinterest in the motives of his life had clinched the sort of half decisionhe had made. In an illuminating moment during the prolonged silencebetween them he had seen her in a new light. The feeling of vague intimacybrought to him by his thoughts of her became a fixed belief that shebelonged to him--was a part of him--and he was charmed with her manner,and her person, standing there, as with a gift given him.</p><p> And then into his mind came a hundred other thoughts, clamouring thoughts,come out of the hidden parts of him. He began to think that she could leadthe way on a road he wanted to travel. He thought of her wealth and whatit would mean to a man filled with his hunger for power. And through thesethoughts shot others. Something in her had taken hold of him--somethingthat had been also in Janet. He was curious concerning her curiosity abouthis beliefs, and wanted to question her concerning her own beliefs. Hecould see none of Colonel Tom's blustering incompetence in her and thoughther filled with truth as a deep spring is filled with clear water. Hebelieved she would give him something, something that all his life he hadbeen wanting. An old aching hunger that had haunted his nights as a boycame back and he thought that at her hand it might be fed.</p><p> "I--I must read a book about socialism," he said lamely.</p><p> Again they stood in silence, she looking at the floor, he past her headand out at the window. He could not bring himself to speak again of theproposed talk. He had a boyish dread of having her notice the tremor inhis voice.</p><p> Colonel Tom came into the room, bursting with an idea Sam had given him atthe lunch hour and which in working its way into his mind had become tothe colonel's entirely honest belief an idea of his own. The interruptionbrought to Sam an intense feeling of relief and he began talking of thecolonel's idea as though it had taken him unawares.</p><p> Sue, walking to a window, began tying and untying the curtain cord. WhenSam, raising his eyes, looked at her, he caught her eyes watching himintently and she smiled, continuing to look at him squarely. It was hiseyes that first broke away.</p><p> From that day Sam's mind was afire with thoughts of Sue Rainey. In hisroom he sat, or going into Grant Park stood by the lake, looking at thesilent, moving water as he had looked in the days when he first came tothe city. He did not dream of having her in his arms or of kissing herlips; he thought, instead, with a glowing heart, of a life lived with her.He wanted to walk beside her through the streets, to have her comesuddenly in at his office door, to look into her eyes and to have herquestion him, as she had questioned, concerning his beliefs and his hopes.He thought that in the evening he would like to go to a house of his ownand find her sitting there waiting for him. All the charm of his aimless,half-dissolute way of life died in him, and he believed that with her hecould begin to live more fully and completely. From the moment when he haddefinitely decided that he wanted Sue as a wife, Sam stopped overdrinking,going to his room or walking through the streets or in the parks insteadof seeking his old companions in the clubs and drinking places. Sometimespushing his bed to the window overlooking the lake, he would undressimmediately after dinner and opening the window would spend half the nightwatching the lights of boats far away over the water and thinking of her.He would imagine her in the room, moving here and there, and comingoccasionally to put her hand in his hair and look down at him as Janet haddone, helping by her sane talk and quiet ways to get his life straightenedout for good living.</p><p> And when he had fallen asleep the face of Sue Rainey came to visit hisdreams. One night he thought she had become blind and sat in the room withsightless eyes saying over and over like one demented, "Truth, truth, giveme back the truth that I may see," and he awoke sick with horror at thethought of the look of suffering that had been in her face. Never did Samdream of having her in his arms or of raining kisses on her lips and neckas he had dreamed of other women who in the past had won his favour.</p><p> For all that he thought of her so constantly and built so confidently hisdream of a life to be spent with her, months passed before he saw heragain. Through Colonel Tom he learned that she had gone for a visit to theEast and he went earnestly about his work, keeping his mind on hisbusiness during the day and only in the evening allowing himself to becomeabsorbed in thoughts of her. He had a feeling that although he had saidnothing she knew of his desire for her and that she wanted time to thinkit over. Several times in the evening in his room he wrote her longletters filled with minute, boyish explanations of his thoughts andmotives, letters which after writing he immediately destroyed. A woman ofthe west side, with whom he had once had an affair, met him one day on thestreet, and put her hand familiarly on his arm and for the momentreawakened in him an old desire. After leaving her he did not go back tothe office, but taking a south-bound car, spent the afternoon walking inJackson Park, watching the children at play on the grass, sitting onbenches under the trees, getting out of his body and his mind theinsistent call of the flesh that had come back to him.</p><p> Then in the evening, he came suddenly upon Sue riding a spirited blackhorse in a bridle path at the upper end of the park. It was just at thegrey beginning of night. Stopping the horse, she sat looking at him andgoing to her he put a hand on the bridle.</p><p> "We might have that talk," he said.</p><p> She smiled down at him and the colour began to rise in her brown cheeks.</p><p> "I have been thinking of it," she said, the familiar serious look cominginto her eyes. "After all what have we to say to each other?"</p><p> Sam watched her steadily.</p><p> "I have a lot of things to say to you," he announced. "That is to say-well--I have, if things are as I hope." She got off the horse and theystood together by the side of the path. Sam never forgot the few minutesof silence that followed. The wide prospects of green sward, the golfplayer trudging wearily toward them through the uncertain light, his bagupon his shoulder, the air of physical fatigue with which he walked,bending slightly forward, the faint, soft sound of waves washing over alow beach, and the intense waiting look on the face she turned up to him,made an impression on his mind that stayed with him through life. Itseemed to him that he had arrived at a kind of culmination, a startingpoint, and that all the vague shadowy uncertainties that had, inreflective moments, flitted through his mind, were to be brushed away bysome act, some word, from the lips of this woman. With a rush he realisedhow consistently he had been thinking of her and how enormously he hadbeen counting on her falling in with his plans, and the realisation wasfollowed by a sickening moment of fear. How little he actually knew of herand of her way of thought. What assurance had he that she would not laugh,jump back upon the horse, and ride away? He was afraid as he had neverbeen afraid before. Dumbly his mind groped about for a way to begin.Expressions he had caught and noted in her strong serious little face whenhe had achieved but a mild curiosity concerning her came back to visit hismind and he tried desperately to build an instant idea of her from these.And then turning his face from her he plunged directly into his thoughtsof the past months as though she had been sharing talking to the colonel."</p><p> "I have been thinking we might marry, you and I," he said, and cursedhimself for the blundering bluntness of the declaration.</p><p> "You do get things done, don't you?" she replied, smiling.</p><p> "Why should you have been thinking anything of the sort?"</p><p> "Because I want to live with you," he said; "I have been talking to thecolonel."</p><p> "About marrying me?" She seemed about to begin laughing.</p><p> He hurried on. "No, not that. We talked about you. I could not let himalone. He might have known. I kept making him talk. I made him tell meabout your ideas. I felt I had to know."</p><p> Sam faced her.</p><p> "He thinks your ideas absurd. I do not. I like them. I like you. I thinkyou are beautiful. I do not know whether I love you or not, but for weeksI have been thinking of you and clinging to you and saying over and overto myself, 'I want to live my life with Sue Rainey.' I did not expect togo at it this way. You know me. What you do not know I will tell you."</p><p> "Sam McPherson, you are a wonder," she said, "and I do not know but that Iwill marry you in the end, but I can't tell now. I want to know a lot ofthings. I want to know if you are ready to believe what I believe and tolive for what I want to live."</p><p> The horse, growing restless, began tugging at the bridle and she spoke tohim sharply. She plunged into a description of a man she had seen on thelecture platform during her visit to the East and Sam looked at her withpuzzled eyes.</p><p> "He was beautiful," she said. "He was past sixty but looked like a boy oftwenty-five, not in his body, but in an air of youth that hung over him.He stood there before the people talking, quiet, able, efficient. He wasclean. He had lived clean, body and mind. He had been companion and coworker with William Morris, and once he had been a mine boy in Wales, buthe had got hold of a vision and lived for it. I did not hear what he said,but I kept thinking, 'I want a man like that.'</p><p> "Can you accept my beliefs and live for what I want to live?" shepersisted.</p><p> Sam looked at the ground. It seemed to him that he was going to lose her,that she would not marry him.</p><p> "I am not accepting beliefs or ends in life blindly," he said stoutly,"but I want them. What are your beliefs? I want to know. I think I haven'tany myself. When I reach for them they are gone. My mind shifts andchanges. I want something solid. I like solid things. I want you."</p><p> "When can we meet and talk everything over thoroughly?"</p><p> "Now," answered Sam bluntly, some look in her face changing his wholeviewpoint. Suddenly it seemed as though a door had been opened, letting ina strong light upon the darkness of his mind. His confidence had come backto him. He wanted to strike and keep on striking. The blood rushed throughhis body and his brain began working rapidly. He felt sure of ultimatesuccess.</p><p> Taking her hand, and leading the horse, he began walking with her alongthe path. Her hand trembled in his and as though answering a thought inhis mind she looked up at him and said,</p><p> "I am not different from other women, although I do not accept your offer.This is a big moment for me, perhaps the biggest moment of my life. I wantyou to know that I feel that, though I do want certain things more than Iwant you or any other man."</p><p> There was a suggestion of tears in her voice and Sam had a feeling thatthe woman in her wanted him to take her into his arms, but somethingwithin him told him to wait and to help her by waiting. Like her he wantedsomething more than the feel of a woman in his arms. Ideas rushed throughhis head; he thought that she was going to give him some bigger idea thanhe had known. The figure she had drawn for him of the old man who stood onthe platform, young and beautiful, the old boyish need of a purpose inlife, the dreams of the last few weeks--all of these were a part of theeager curiosity in him. They were like hungry little animals waiting to befed. "We must have it all out here and now," he told himself. "I must notlet myself be swept away by a rush of feeling and I must not let her be.</p><p> "Do not think," he said, "that I haven't tenderness for you. I am filledwith it. But I want to have our talk. I want to know what you expect me tobelieve and how you want me to live."</p><p> He felt her hand stiffen in his.</p><p> "Whether or not we are worth while to each other," she added.</p><p> "Yes," he said.</p><p> And then she began to talk, telling him in a quiet steady voice thatsteadied something in him what she wanted to make out of her life. Heridea was one of service to mankind through children. She had seen girlfriends of hers, with whom she had gone to school, grow up and marry. Theyhad wealth and education, fine well-trained bodies, and they had beenmarried only to live lives more fully devoted to pleasure. One or two whohad married poor men had only done so to satisfy a passion in themselves,and after marriage had joined the others in the hungry pursuit ofpleasure.</p><p> "They do nothing at all," she said, "to repay the world for the thingsgiven them, the wealth and well-trained bodies and the disciplined minds.They go through life day after day and year after year wasting themselvesand come in the end to nothing but indolent, slovenly vanity."</p><p> She had thought it all out and had tried to plan for herself a life withother ends, and wanted a husband in accord with her ideas.</p><p> "That isn't so difficult," she said, "I can find a man whom I can controland who will believe as I believe. My money gives me that power. But Iwant him to be a real man, a man of ability, a man who does things forhimself, one fitted by his life and his achievements to be the father ofchildren who do things. And so I began thinking about you. I got the menwho come to the house to talk of you."</p><p> She hung her head and laughed like a bashful boy.</p><p> "I know much of the story of your early life out in that Iowa town," shesaid. "I got the story of your life and your achievements out there fromsome one who knew you well."</p><p> The idea seemed wonderfully simple and beautiful to Sam. It seemed to addtremendously to the dignity and nobility of his feeling for her. Hestopped in the path and swung her about facing him. They were alone inthat end of the park. The soft darkness of the summer night had settledover them. In the grass at their feet a cricket sang loudly. He made amovement to take her into his arms.</p><p> "It is wonderful," he said.</p><p> "Wait," she demanded, putting her hand against his shoulder. "It isn't sosimple. I am wealthy. You are able and you have a kind of undying energyin you. I want to give both my wealth and your ability to children--ourchildren. That will not be easy for you. It means giving up your dreams ofpower. Perhaps I shall lose courage. Women do after two or three havecome. You will have to furnish that. You will have to make a mother of meand keep making a mother of me. You will have to be a new kind of fatherwith something maternal in you. You will have to be patient and studiousand kind. You will have to think of these things at night instead ofthinking of your own advancement. You will have to live wholly for mebecause I am to be their mother, giving me your strength and courage andyour good sane outlook on things. And then when they come you will have togive all these things to them day after day in a thousand little ways."</p><p> Sam took her into his arms and for the first time in his memory the hottears stood in his eyes.</p><p> The horse, unattended, wheeled, threw up his head and trotted off down thepath. They let him go, walking along after him hand in hand like two happychildren. At the entrance to the park they came up to him, held by a parkpoliceman. She got on the horse and Sam stood beside her looking up.</p><p> "I'll tell the colonel in the morning," he said.</p><p> "What will he say?" she murmured, musingly.</p><p> "Damned ingrate," Sam mimicked the colonel's blustering throat tones.</p><p> She laughed and picked up the reins. Sam laid his hand on hers.</p><p> "How soon?" he asked.</p><p> She put her head down near his.</p><p> "We'll waste no time," she said, blushing.</p><p> And then in the presence of a park policeman, in the street by theentrance to the park with the people passing up and down, Sam had hisfirst kiss from Sue Rainey's lips.</p><p> After she rode away Sam walked. He had no sense of the passing of time,wandering through street after street, rearranging and readjusting hisoutlook on life. What she had said had stirred every vestige of sleepingnobility in him. He thought that he had got hold of the thing he hadunconsciously been seeking all his life. His dreams of control of theRainey Arms Company and the other big things he had planned in businessseemed, in the light of their talk, so much nonsense and vanity. "I willlive for this! I will live for this!" he kept saying over and over tohimself. He imagined he could see the little white things lying in Sue'sarms, and his new love for her and for what they were to accomplishtogether ran through him and hurt him so that he felt like shouting in thedarkened streets. He looked up at the sky and saw the stars and thoughtthey looked down on two new and glorious beings living on the earth.</p><p> At a corner he turned and came into a quiet residence street where framehouses stood in the midst of little green lawns and thoughts of hisboyhood in the Iowa town came back to him. And then his mind movingforward, he remembered nights in the city when he had stolen away to thearms of women. Hot shame burned in his cheeks and his eyes felt hot.</p><p> "I must go to her--I must go to her at her house--now--tonight--and tellher all of these things, and beg her to forgive me," he thought.</p><p> And then the absurdity of such a course striking him he laughed aloud.</p><p> "It cleanses me! this cleanses me!" he said to himself.</p><p> He remembered the men who had sat about the stove in Wildman's grocerywhen he was a boy and the stories they sometimes told. He remembered howhe, as a boy in the city, had run through the crowded streets fleeing fromthe terror of lust. He began to understand how distorted, how strangelyperverted, his whole attitude toward women and sex had been. "Sex is asolution, not a menace--it is wonderful," he told himself without knowingfully the meaning of the word that had sprung to his lips.</p><p> When, at last, he turned into Michigan Avenue and went toward hisapartment, the late moon was just mounting the sky and a clock in one ofthe sleeping houses was striking three.</p><h2>Book II - Chapter 6</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> One evening, six weeks after the talk in the gathering darkness in JacksonPark, Sue Rainey and Sam McPherson sat on the deck of a Lake Michigansteamer watching the lights of Chicago blink out in the distance. They hadbeen married that afternoon in Colonel Tom's big house on the south side;and now they sat on the deck of the boat, being carried out into darkness,vowed to motherhood and to fatherhood, each more or less afraid of theother. They sat in silence, looking at the blinking lights and listeningto the low voices of their fellow passengers, also sitting in the chairsalong the deck or strolling leisurely about, and to the wash of the wateralong the sides of the boat, eager to break down a little reserve that thesolemnity of the marriage service had built up between them.</p><p> A picture floated in Sam's mind. He saw Sue, all in white, radiant andwonderful, coming toward him down a broad stairway, toward him, thenewsboy of Caxton, the smuggler of game, the roisterer, the greedymoneygetter. All during those six weeks he had been waiting for this hourwhen he should sit beside the little grey-clad figure, getting from herthe help he wanted in the reconstruction of his life. Without being ableto talk as he had thought of talking, he yet felt assured and easy in hismind. In the moment when she had come down the stairway he had been halfovercome by a feeling of intense shame, a return of the shame that hadswept over him that night when she had given her word and he had walkedhour after hour through the streets. It had seemed to him that from amongthe guests standing about should arise a voice crying, "Stop! Do not goon! Let me tell you of this fellow--this McPherson!" And then he had seenher holding to the arm of swaggering, pretentious Colonel Tom and he hadtaken her hand to become one with her, two curious, feverish, strangelydifferent human beings, taking a vow in the name of their God, with theflowers banked about them and the eyes of people upon them.</p><p> When Sam had gone to Colonel Tom the morning after that evening in JacksonPark, there had been a scene. The old gun maker had blustered and roaredand forbidden, pounding on his desk with his fist. When Sam remained cooland unimpressed, he had stormed out of the room slamming the door andshouting, "Upstart! Damned upstart!" and Sam had gone smiling back to hisdesk, mildly disappointed. "I told Sue he would say 'Ingrate,'" hethought, "I am losing my skill at guessing just what he will do and say."</p><p> The colonel's rage had been short-lived. Within a week he was boasting ofSam to chance callers as "the best business man in America," and in theface of a solemn promise given Sue was telling news of the approachingmarriage to every newspaper man he knew. Sam suspected him of secretlycalling on the telephone those newspapers whose representatives had notcrossed his trail.</p><p> During the six waiting weeks there had been little of love making betweenSue and Sam. They had talked instead, or, going into the country or to theparks, had walked under the trees consumed with a curious eager passion ofsuspense. The idea she had given him in the park grew in Sam's brain. Tolive for the young things that would presently come to them, to be simple,direct, and natural, like the trees or the beasts of the field, and thento have the native honesty of such a life illuminated and ennobled by amutual intelligent purpose to make their young something finer and betterthan the things in Nature by the intelligent use of their own good mindsand bodies. In the shops and on the streets the hurrying men and womentook on a new significance to him. He wondered what secret mighty purposemight be in their lives, and read a newspaper report of an engagement or amarriage with a little jump of the heart. He looked at the girls and thewomen at work over the typewriting machines in the office, withquestioning eyes, asking himself why they did not seek marriage openly anddeterminedly, and saw a healthy single woman as so much wasted material,as a machine for producing healthy new life standing idle and unused inthe great workshop of the universe. "Marriage is a port, a beginning, apoint of departure, from which men and women go forth upon the real voyageof life," he told Sue one evening as they walked in the park. "All thatgoes before is but a preparation, a building. The pains and the triumphsof all unmarried people are but the good oak planks being driven intoplace to make the vessel fit for the real voyage." Or, again, one nightwhen they were in a rowboat on the lagoon in the park and all about themin the darkness was the plash of oars in the water, the screams of excitedgirls, and the sound of voices calling, he let the boat float in againstthe shores of a little island and crept along the boat to kneel, with hishead in her lap and whisper, "It is not the love of a woman that grips me,Sue, but the love of life. I have had a peep into the great mystery. This--this is why we are here--this justifies us."</p><p> Now that she sat beside him, her shoulder against his own, being carriedaway with him into darkness and privacy, the personal side of his love forher ran through Sam like a flame and, turning, he drew her head down uponhis shoulder.</p><p> "Not yet, Sam," she whispered, "not with these hundreds of people sleepingand drinking and thinking and going about their affairs almost withintouch of our hands."</p><p> They got up and walked along the swaying deck. Out of the north the cleanwind called to them, the stars looked down upon them, and in the darknessin the bow of the boat they parted for the night silently, speechless withhappiness and with a dear, unmentioned secret between them.</p><p> At dawn they landed at a little lumbering town, where boat, blankets, andcamping kit had gone before. A river flowed down out of the woods passingthe town, going under a bridge and turning the wheel of a sawmill thatstood by the shore of the river facing the lake. The clean sweet smell ofthe new-cut logs, the song of the saws, the roar of the water tumblingover a dam, the cries of the blue-shirted lumbermen working among thefloating logs above the dam, filled the morning air, and above the song ofthe saws sang another song, a breathless, waiting song, the song of loveand of life singing in the hearts of husband and wife.</p><p> In a little roughly-built lumberman's hotel they ate breakfast in a roomoverlooking the river. The proprietor of the hotel, a large red-facedwoman in a clean calico dress, was expecting them and, having served thebreakfast, went out of the room grinning good naturedly and closing thedoor behind her. Through the open window they looked at the cold swiftlyflowing river and at a freckled-faced boy who carried packages wrapped inblankets and put them in a long canoe tied to a little wharf beside thehotel. They ate and sat staring at each other like two strange boys,saying nothing. Sam ate little. His heart pounded in his breast.</p><p> On the river he sank his paddle deep into the water, pulling against thecurrent. During the six weeks' waiting in Chicago she had taught him theessentials of the canoeist's art and, now, as he shot the canoe under thebridge and around a bend of the river out of sight of the town, asuperhuman strength seemed in his arms and back. Before him in the prow ofthe boat sat Sue, her straight muscular little back bending andstraightening again. By his side rose towering hills clothed with pinetrees, and piles of cut logs lay at the foot of the hills along the shore.</p><p> At sunset they landed in a little cleared space at the foot of a hill andon the top of the hill, with the wind blowing across it, they made theirfirst camp. Sam brought boughs and spread them, lapped like feathers inthe wings of a bird, and carried blankets up the hill, while Sue, at thefoot, near the overturned boat, built a fire and prepared their firstcooked meal out of doors. In the failing light, Sue got out her rifle andgave Sam his first lesson in marksmanship, his awkwardness making thelesson half a jest. And then, in the soft stillness of the young night,with the first stars coming into the sky and the clean cold wind blowinginto their faces, they went arm in arm up the hill under the trees towhere the tops of the trees rolled and pitched like the stormy waters of agreat sea before their eyes, and lay down together for their first longtender embrace.</p><p> There is a special kind of fine pleasure in getting one's first knowledgeof the great outdoors in the company of a woman a man loves and to havethat woman an expert, with a keen appetite for the life, adds point andflavour to the experience. In his busy striving, nickel-seeking boyhood inthe town surrounded by hot cornfields, and in his young manhood ofscheming and money hunger in the city, Sam had not thought of vacationsand resting places. He had walked on country roads with John Telfer andMary Underwood, listening to their talk, absorbing their ideas, blind anddeaf to the little life in the grass, in the leafy branches of the treesand in the air about him. In clubs, and about hotels and barrooms in thecity, he had heard men talk of life in the open, and had said to himself,"When my time comes I will taste these things."</p><p> And now he did taste them, lying on his back on the grass along the river,floating down quiet little side streams in the moonlight, listening to thenight call of birds, or watching the flight of frightened wild things ashe pushed the canoe into the quiet depths of the great forest about them.</p><p> At night, under the little tent they had brought, or beneath the blanketsunder the stars, he slept lightly, awakening often to look at Sue lyingbeside him. Perhaps the wind had blown a wisp of hair across her face andher breath played with it, tossing it about; perhaps just the quiet of herexpressive little face charmed and held him, so that he turned reluctantlyto sleep again thinking that he might, with pleasure, go on looking at herall night.</p><p> For Sue the days also passed lightly. She also awoke in the night and laylooking at the man sleeping beside her, and once she told Sam that when heawoke she feigned sleep dreading to rob him of the pleasure that she knewthese secret love passages gave to both.</p><p> They were not alone in those northern woods. Everywhere along the riversand on the shores of little lakes they found people, to Sam a new kind ofpeople, who dropped all the ordinary things of life, and ran away to thewoods and the streams to spend long happy months in the open. Hediscovered with surprise that these adventurers were men of modestfortunes, small manufacturers, skilled workingmen, retail merchants. Onewith whom he talked was a grocer from a town in Ohio, and when Sam askedhim if the coming to the woods with his family for an eight-weeks stay didnot endanger the success of his business he agreed with Sam that it did,nodding his head and laughing.</p><p> "But there would be a lot more danger in not leaving it," he said, "thedanger of having my boys grow up to be men without my having any real funwith them."</p><p> Among all of the people they met Sue passed with a sort of happy freedomthat confounded Sam, as he had formed a habit of thinking of her always asone shut within herself. Many of the people they saw she knew, and he cameto believe that she had chosen the place for their love making because sheadmired and held in high favour the lives of these people of the out-ofdoors and wanted her lover to be in some way like them. Out of thesolitude of the woods, along the shores of little lakes, they called toher as she passed, demanding that she come ashore and show her husband,and among them she sat talking of other seasons and of the inroads of thelumber men upon their paradise. "The Burnhams were this year on the shoresof Grant Lake, the two school teachers from Pittsburgh would come early inAugust, the Detroit man with the crippled son was building a cabin on theshores of Bone River."</p><p> Sam sat among them in silence, renewing constantly his admiration for thewonder of Sue's past life. She, the daughter of Colonel Tom, the womanrich in her own right, to have made her friends among these people; she,who had been pronounced an enigma by the young men of Chicago, to havebeen secretly all of these years the companion and fellow spirit of thesecampers by the lakes.</p><p> For six weeks they led a wandering, nomadic life in that half wild land,for Sue six weeks of tender love making, and of the expression of everythought and impulse of her fine nature, for Sam six weeks of readjustmentand freedom, during which he learned to sail a boat, to shoot, and to getthe fine taste of that life into his being.</p><p> And then one morning they came again to the little lumber town at themouth of the river and sat upon the pier waiting for the Chicago boat.They were bound once more into the world, and to that life together thatwas the foundation of their marriage and that was to be the end and aim oftheir two lives.</p><p> If Sam's life from boyhood had been, on the whole, barren and empty ofmany of the sweeter things, his life during the next year was strikinglyfull and complete. In the office he had ceased being the pushing upstarttramping on the toes of tradition and had become the son of Colonel Tom,the voter of Sue's big stock holdings, the practical, directing head andgenius of the destinies of the company. Jack Prince's loyalty had beenrewarded, and a huge advertising campaign made the name and merits of theRainey Arms Company's wares known to all reading Americans. The muzzles ofRainey-Whittaker rifles, revolvers, and shotguns looked threateningly outat one from the pages of the great popular magazines, brown fur-cladhunters did brave deeds before one's eyes, kneeling upon snow-topped cragspreparing to speed winged death to waiting mountain sheep; huge openmouthed bears rushed down from among the type at the top of the pages andseemed about to devour cool deliberate sportsmen who stood undaunted,swinging their trusty Rainey-Whittakers into place, and presidents,explorers, and Texas gun fighters loudly proclaimed the merits of RaineyWhittakers to a gun-buying world. It was for Sam and for Colonel Tom atime of big dividends, mechanical progress, and contentment.</p><p> Sam stayed diligently at work in the offices and in the shops, but keptwithin himself a reserve of strength and resolution that might have goneinto the work. With Sue he took up golf and morning rides on horseback,and with Sue he sat during the long evenings, reading aloud, absorbing herideas and her beliefs. Sometimes for days they were like two children,going off together to walk on country roads and to sleep in countryhotels. On these walks they went hand in hand or, bantering each other,raced down long hills to lie panting in the grass by the roadside whenthey were out of breath.</p><p> Near the end of the first year she told him one night of the realisationof their hopes and they sat through the evening alone by the fire in herroom, filled with the white wonder of it, renewing to each other all thefine vows of their early love-making days.</p><p> Sam never succeeded in recapturing the flavour of those days. Happiness isa thing so vague, so indefinite, so dependent on a thousand little turnsof the events of the day, that it only visits the most fortunate and atrare intervals, but Sam thought that he and Sue touched almost idealhappiness constantly during that time. There were weeks and even months oftheir first year together that later passed out of Sam's memory entirely,leaving only a sense of completeness and well being. He could remember,perhaps, a winter walk in the moonlight by the frozen lake, or a visitorwho sat and talked an evening away by their fire. But at the end he had tocome back to this: that something sang in his heart all day long and thatthe air tasted better, the stars shone more brightly, and the wind and therain and the hail upon the window panes sang more sweetly in his ears. Heand the woman who lived with him had wealth, position, and infinitedelight in the presence and the persons of each other, and a great ideaburned like a lamp in a window at the end of the road they travelled.</p><p> Meanwhile, in the world about him events came and went. A president waselected, the grey wolves were being hunted out of the Chicago citycouncil, and a strong rival to his company flourished in his own city. Inother days he would have been down upon this rival fighting, planning,working for its destruction. Now he sat at Sue's feet, dreaming andtalking to her of the brood that under their care should grow intowonderful reliant men and women. When Lewis, the talented sales manager ofthe Edwards Arms Company, got the business of a Kansas City jobber, hesmiled, wrote a sharp letter to his man in that territory, and went for anafternoon of golf with Sue. He had completely and wholly accepted Sue'sconception of life. "We have wealth for any emergency," he said tohimself, "and we will live our lives for service to mankind through thechildren that will presently come into our house."</p><p> After their marriage Sam found that Sue, for all her apparent coldness andindifference, had in Chicago, as in the northern woods, her own littlecircle of men and women. Some of these people Sam had met during theengagement, and now they began gradually coming to the house for anevening with the McPhersons. Sometimes there would be several of them fora quiet dinner at which there was much good talk, and after which Sue andSam sat for half the night, continuing some vein of thought brought tothem. Among the people who came to them, Sam shone resplendent. In someindefinable way he thought they paid court to him and the thoughtflattered him immensely. The college professor who had talked brilliantlythrough an evening turned to Sam for approval of his conclusions, a writerof tales of cowboy life asked him to help him over a difficulty in thestock market, and a tall black-haired painter paid him the rare complimentof repeating one of Sam's remarks as his own. It was as though, in spiteof their talk, they thought him the most gifted of them all, and for atime he was puzzled by their attitude. Jack Prince came, sat at one of thedinner parties, and explained.</p><p> "You have got what they want and cannot get--the money," he said.</p><p> After the evening when Sue told him the great news they gave a dinner. Itwas a sort of welcoming party for the coming guest, and, while the peopleat the table ate and talked, Sue and Sam, from opposite ends of the table,lifted high their glasses and, looking into each other's eyes, drank offthe health of him who was to come, the first of the great family, thefamily that was to have two lives lived for its success.</p><p> At the table sat Colonel Tom with his broad white shirt front, his white,pointed beard, and his grandiloquent flow of talk; at Sue's side sat JackPrince, pausing in his open admiration of Sue to cast an eye on thehandsome New York girl at Sam's end of the table or to puncture, with aflash of his terse common sense, some balloon of theory launched byWilliams of the University, who sat on the other side of Sue; the artist,who hoped for a commission to paint Colonel Tom, sat opposite himbewailing the dying out of fine old American families; and a serious-facedlittle German scientist sat beside Colonel Tom smiling as the artisttalked. The man, Sam fancied, was laughing at them both, perhaps at all ofthem. He did not mind. He looked at the scientist and at the other facesup and down the table and then at Sue. He saw her directing and leadingthe talk; he saw the play of muscles about her strong neck and the finefirmness of her straight little body, and his eyes grew moist and a lumpcame into his throat at the thought of the secret that lay between them.</p><p> And then his mind ran back to another night in Caxton when first he sateating among strange people at Freedom Smith's table. He saw again thetomboy girl and the sturdy boy and the lantern swinging in Freedom's handin the close little stable; he saw the absurd housepainter trying to blowthe bugle in the street; and the mother talking to her boy of deaththrough the summer evening; the fat foreman making the record of his loveson the walls of his room, the narrow-faced commission man rubbing hishands before a group of Greek hucksters, and then this--this home with itssafety and its secret high aim and him sitting there at the head of itall. Like the novelist, it seemed to him that he should admire and bow hishead before the romance of destiny. He thought his station, his wife, hiscountry, his end in life, when rightly seen, the very apex of life on theearth, and to him in his pride it seemed that he was in some way themaster and maker of it all.</p><h2>Book II - Chapter 7</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> Late one evening, some weeks after the McPhersons had given the dinnerparty in secret celebration of the future arrival of what was to be thefirst of the great family, they came together down the steps of a northside house to their waiting carriage. They had spent, Sam thought, adelightful evening. The Grovers were people of whose friendship he wasparticularly proud and since his marriage with Sue he had taken her oftenfor an evening to the house of the venerable surgeon. Doctor Grover was ascholar, a man of note in the medical world, and a rapid and absorbingtalker and thinker on any subject that aroused his interest. A certainyouthful enthusiasm in his outlook on life had attracted to him thedevotion of Sue, who, since meeting him through Sam, had counted him amarked addition to their little group of friends. His wife, a whitehaired, plump little woman, was, though apparently somewhat diffident, inreality his intellectual equal and companion, and Sue in a quiet way hadtaken her as a model in her own effort toward complete wifehood.</p><p> During the evening, spent in a rapid exchange of opinions and ideasbetween the two men, Sue had sat in silence. Once when he looked at herSam thought that he had surprised an annoyed look in her eyes and waspuzzled by it. During the remainder of the evening her eyes refused tomeet his and she looked instead at the floor, a flush mounting her cheeks.</p><p> At the door of the carriage Frank, Sue's coachman, stepped on the hem ofher gown and tore it. The tear was slight, the incident Sam thoughtentirely unavoidable, and as much due to a momentary clumsiness on thepart of Sue as to the awkwardness of Frank. The man had for years been aloyal servant and a devoted admirer of Sue's.</p><p> Sam laughed and taking Sue by the arm started to help her in at thecarriage door.</p><p> "Too much gown for an athlete," he said, pointlessly.</p><p> In a flash Sue turned and faced the coachman.</p><p> "Awkward brute," she said, through her teeth.</p><p> Sam stood on the sidewalk dumb with astonishment as Frank turned andclimbed to his seat without waiting to close the carriage door. He felt ashe might have felt had he, as a boy, heard profanity from the lips of hismother. The look in Sue's eyes as she turned them on Frank struck him likea blow and in a moment his whole carefully built-up conception of her andof her character had been shaken. He had an impulse to slam the carriagedoor after her and walk home.</p><p> They drove home in silence, Sam feeling as though he rode beside a new andstrange being. In the light of passing street lamps he could see her faceheld straight ahead and her eyes staring stonily at the curtain in front.He didn't want to reproach her; he wanted to take hold of her arm andshake her. "I should like to take the whip from in front of Frank's seatand give her a sound beating," he told himself.</p><p> At the house Sue jumped out of the carriage and, running past him in atthe door, closed it after her. Frank drove off toward the stables and whenSam went into the house he found Sue standing half way up the stairsleading to her room and waiting for him.</p><p> "I presume you do not know that you have been openly insulting me allevening," she cried. "Your beastly talk there at the Grovers--it wasunbearable--who are these women? Why parade your past life before me?"</p><p> Sam said nothing. He stood at the foot of the stairs and looked up at herand then, turning, just as she, running up the stairs, slammed the door ofher own room, he went into the library. A wood fire burned in the grateand he sat down and lighted his pipe. He did not try to think the thingout. He felt that he was in the presence of a lie and that the Sue who hadlived in his mind and in his affections no longer existed, that in herplace there was this other woman, this woman who had insulted her ownservant and had perverted and distorted the meaning of his talk during theevening.</p><p> Sitting by the fire filling and refilling his pipe, Sam went carefullyover every word, gesture, and incident of the evening at the Grovers andcould get hold of no part of it that he thought might in fairness serve asan excuse for the outburst. In the upper part of the house he could hearSue moving restlessly about and he had satisfaction in the thought thather mind was punishing her for so strange a seizure. He and Grover hadperhaps been somewhat carried away, he told himself; they had talked ofmarriage and its meaning and had both declared somewhat hotly against theidea that the loss of virginity in women was in any sense a bar tohonourable marriage, but he had said nothing that he thought could havebeen twisted into an insult to Sue or to Mrs. Grover. He had thought thetalk rather good and clearly thought out and had come out of the houseexhilarated and secretly preening himself with the thought that he hadtalked unusually forcefully and well. In any event what had been said hadbeen said before in Sue's presence and he thought that he could rememberher having, in the past, expressed similar ideas with enthusiasm.</p><p> Hour after hour he sat in the chair before the dying fire. He dozed andhis pipe dropped from his hand and fell upon the stone hearth. A kind ofdumb misery and anger was in him as over and over endlessly his mind keptreviewing the events of the evening.</p><p> "What has made her think she can do that to me?" he kept asking himself.</p><p> He remembered certain strange silences and hard looks from her eyes duringthe past weeks, silences and looks that in the light of the events of theevening became pregnant with meaning.</p><p> "She has a temper, a beast of a temper. Why shouldn't she have been squareand told me?" he asked himself.</p><p> The clock had struck three when the library door opened quietly and Sue,clad in a dressing gown through which the new roundness of her lithelittle figure was plainly apparent, came into the room. She ran across tohim and putting her head down on his knee wept bitterly.</p><p> "Oh, Sam!" she said, "I think I am going insane. I have been hating you asI have not hated since I was an evil-tempered child. A thing I workedyears to suppress in me has come back. I have been hating myself and thebaby. For days I have been fighting the feeling in me, and now it has comeout and perhaps you have begun hating me. Can you love me again? Will youever forget the meanness and the cheapness of it? You and poor innocentFrank--Oh, Sam, the devil was in me!"</p><p> Reaching down, Sam took her into his arms and cuddled her like a child. Astory he had heard of the vagaries of women at such times came back to himand was as a light illuminating the darkness of his mind.</p><p> "I understand now," he said. "It is a part of the burden you carry for usboth."</p><p> For some weeks after the outbreak at the carriage door events ran smoothlyin the McPherson house. One day as he stood in the stable door Frank cameround the corner of the house and, looking up sheepishly from under hiscap, said to Sam: "I understand about the missus. It is the baby coming.We have had four of them at our house," and Sam, nodding his head, turnedand began talking rapidly of his plans to replace the carriages withautomobiles.</p><p> But in the house, in spite of the clearing up of the matter of Sue'sugliness at the Grovers, a subtle change had taken place in therelationship of the two. Although they were together facing the first ofthe events that were to be like ports-of-call in the great voyage of theirlives, they were not facing it with the same mutual understanding andkindly tolerance with which they had faced smaller things in the past--adisagreement over the method of shooting a rapid in a river or theentertainment of an undesirable guest. The inclination to fits of temperloosens and disarranges all the little wires of life. The tune will notget itself played. One stands waiting for the discord, strained, missingthe harmony. It was so with Sam. He began feeling that he must keep acheck upon his tongue and that things of which they had talked with greatfreedom six months earlier now annoyed and irritated his wife when broughtinto an after-dinner discussion. To Sam, who, during his life with Sue,had learned the joy of free, open talk upon any subject that came into hismind and whose native interest in life and in the motives of men and womenhad blossomed in the large leisure and independence of the last year, thiswas trying. It was, he thought, like trying to hold free and opencommunion with the people of an orthodox family, and he fell into a habitof prolonged silences, a habit that later, he found, once formed,unbelievably hard to break.</p><p> One day in the office a situation arose that seemed to demand Sam'spresence in Boston on a certain date. For months he had been carrying on atrade war with some of the eastern manufacturers in his line and anopportunity for the settlement of the trouble in a way advantageous tohimself had, he thought, arisen. He wanted to handle the matter himselfand went home to explain to Sue. It was at the end of a day when nothinghad occurred to irritate her and she agreed with him that he should not becompelled to trust so important a matter to another.</p><p> "I am no child, Sam. I will take care of myself," she said, laughing.</p><p> Sam wired his New York man asking him to make the arrangements for themeeting in Boston and picked up a book to spend the evening reading aloudto her.</p><p> And then, coming home the next evening he found her in tears and when hetried to laugh away her fears she flew into a black fit of anger and ranout of the room.</p><p> Sam went to the 'phone and called his New York man, thinking to instructhim in regard to the conference in Boston and to give up his own plans forthe trip. When he had got his man on the wire, Sue, who had been standingoutside the door, rushed in and put her hand over the mouthpiece of the'phone.</p><p> "Sam! Sam!" she cried. "Do not give up the trip! Scold me! Beat me! Doanything, but do not let me go on making a fool of myself and destroyingyour peace of mind! I shall be miserable if you stay at home because ofwhat I have said!"</p><p> Over the 'phone came the insistent voice of Central and putting her handaside Sam talked to his man, letting the engagement stand and making somedetail of the conference answer as his need of calling.</p><p> Again Sue was repentant and again after her tears they sat before the fireuntil his train time, talking like lovers.</p><p> To Buffalo in the morning came a wire from her.</p><p> "Come back. Let business go. Cannot stand it," she had wired.</p><p> While he sat reading the wire the porter brought another.</p><p> "Please, Sam, pay no attention to any wire from me. I am all right andonly half a fool."</p><p> Sam was irritated. "It is deliberate pettiness and weakness," he thought,when an hour later the porter brought another wire demanding his immediatereturn. "The situation calls for drastic action and perhaps one goodstinging reproof will stop it for all time."</p><p> Going into the buffet car he wrote a long letter calling her attention tothe fact that a certain amount of freedom of action was due him, andsaying that he intended to act upon his own judgment in the future and notupon her impulses.</p><p> Having begun to write Sam went on and on. He was not interrupted, noshadow crossed the face of his beloved to tell him he was hurting and hesaid all that was in his mind to say. Little sharp reproofs that had comeinto his mind but that had been left unsaid now got themselves said andwhen he had dumped his overloaded mind into the letter he sealed andmailed it at a passing station.</p><p> Within an hour after the letter had left his hands Sam regretted it. Hethought of the little woman bearing the burden for them both, and thingsGrover had told him of the unhappiness of women in her condition came backto haunt his mind so that he wrote and sent off to her a wire asking hernot to read the letter he had mailed and assuring her that he would hurrythrough the Boston conference and get back to her at once.</p><p> When Sam returned he knew that in an evil moment Sue had opened and readthe letter sent from the train and was surprised and hurt by theknowledge. The act seemed like a betrayal. He said nothing, going abouthis work with a troubled mind and watching with growing anxiety heralternate fits of white anger and fearful remorse. He thought her growingworse daily and became alarmed for her health.</p><p> And, then, after a talk with Grover he began to spend more and more timewith her, forcing her to take with him daily, long walks in the open air.He tried valiantly to keep her mind fixed on cheerful things and went tobed happy and relieved when a day ended that did not bring a stormypassage between them.</p><p> There were days during that period when Sam thought himself near insanity.With a light in her grey eyes that was maddening Sue would take up someminor thing, a remark he had made or a passage he had quoted from somebook, and in a dead, level, complaining tone would talk of it until hishead reeled and his fingers ached from the gripping of his hands to keepcontrol of himself. After such a day he would steal off by himself and,walking rapidly, would try through pure physical fatigue to force his mindto give up the remembrance of the persistent, complaining voice. At timeshe would give way to fits of anger and strew impotent oaths along thesilent street, or, in another mood, would mumble and talk to himself,praying for strength and courage to keep his own head during the ordealthrough which he thought they were passing together. And when he returnedfrom such a walk and from such a struggle with himself it often occurredthat he would find her waiting in the arm chair before the fire in herroom, her mind clear and her little face wet with the tears of herrepentance.</p><p> And then the struggle ended. With Doctor Grover it had been arranged thatSue should be taken to the hospital for the great event, and they drovethere hurriedly one night through the quiet streets, the recurring painsgripping Sue and her hands clutching his. An exalted cheerfulness had holdof them. Face to face with the actual struggle for the new life Sue wastransfigured. Her voice rang with triumph and her eyes glistened.</p><p> "I am going to do it," she cried; "my black fear is gone. I shall give youa child--a man child. I shall succeed, my man Sam. You shall see. It willbe beautiful."</p><p> When the pain gripped she gripped at his hand, and a spasm of physicalsympathy ran through him. He felt helpless and ashamed of hishelplessness.</p><p> At the entrance to the hospital grounds she put her face down upon hisknees so that the hot tears ran through his hands.</p><p> "Poor, poor old Sam, it has been horrible for you."</p><p> At the hospital Sam walked up and down in the corridor through theswinging doors at the end of which she had been taken. Every vestige ofregret for the trying months now lying behind had passed, and he paced upand down the corridor feeling that he had come to one of those hugemoments when a man's brain, his grasp of affairs, his hopes and plans forthe future, all of the little details and trivialities of his life, halt,and he waits anxious, breathless, expectant. He looked at a little clockon a table at the end of the corridor, half expecting it to stop also andwait with him. His marriage hour that had seemed so big and vital seemednow, in the quiet corridor, with the stone floor and the silent whiteclad, rubber-shod nurses passing up and down and in the presence of thisgreater event, to have shrunk enormously. He walked up and down peering atthe clock, looking at the swinging door and biting at the stem of hisempty pipe.</p><p> And then through the swinging door came Grover.</p><p> "We can get the child, Sam, but to get it we shall have to take a chancewith her. Do you want to do that? Do not wait. Decide."</p><p> Sam sprang past him toward the door.</p><p> "You bungler," he cried, and his voice rang through the long quietcorridor. "You do not know what this means. Let me go."</p><p> Doctor Grover, catching him by the arm, swung him about. The two men stoodfacing each other.</p><p> "You stay here," said the doctor, his voice remaining quiet and firm; "Iwill attend to things. Your going in there would be pure folly now. Nowanswer me--do you want to take the chance?"</p><p> "No! No!" Sam shouted. "No! I want her--Sue--alive and well, back throughthat door."</p><p> A cold gleam came into his eyes and he shook his fist before the doctor'sface.</p><p> "Do not try deceiving me about this. By God, I will----"</p><p> Turning, Doctor Grover ran back through the swinging door leaving Samstaring blankly at his back. A nurse, one whom he had seen in DoctorGrover's office, came out of the door and taking his arm, walked besidehim up and down the corridor. Sam put his arm around her shoulder andtalked. An illusion that it was necessary to comfort her came to him.</p><p> "Do not worry," he said. "She will be all right. Grover will take care ofher. Nothing can happen to little Sue."</p><p> The nurse, a small, sweet-faced, Scotch woman, who knew and admired Sue,wept. Some quality in his voice had touched the woman in her and the tearsran in a little stream down her cheeks. Sam continued talking, the woman'stears helping him to regain his grip upon himself.</p><p> "My mother is dead," he said, an old sorrow revisiting him. "I wish thatyou, like Mary Underwood, would be a new mother to me."</p><p> When the time came that he could be taken to the room where Sue lay, hisself-possession had returned to him and his mind had begun blaming thelittle dead stranger for the unhappiness of the past months and for thelong separation from what he thought was the real Sue. Outside the door ofthe room into which she had been taken he stopped, hearing her voice, thinand weak, talking to Grover.</p><p> "Unfit--Sue McPherson unfit," said the voice, and Sam thought it wasfilled with an infinite weariness.</p><p> He ran through the door and dropped on his knees by her bed. She turnedher eyes to him smiling bravely.</p><p> "The next time we'll make it," she said.</p><p> The second child born to the young McPhersons arrived out of time. AgainSam walked, this time through the corridor of his own house and withoutthe consoling presence of the sweet-faced Scotch woman, and again he shookhis head at Doctor Grover who came to him consoling and reassuring.</p><p> After the death of the second child Sue lay for months in bed. In hisarms, in her own room, she wept openly in the presence of Grover and thenurses, crying out against her unfitness. For several days she refused tosee Colonel Tom, harbouring in her mind the notion that he was in some wayresponsible for her physical inability to bear living children, and whenshe got up from her bed, she remained for months white and listless butgrimly determined upon another attempt for the little life she so wantedto feel in her arms.</p><p> During the days of her carrying the second baby she had again the fierceugly attacks of temper that had shattered Sam's nerves, but having learnedto understand, he went quietly about his work, trying as far as in him layto close his ears to the stinging, hurtful things she sometimes said; andthe third time, it was agreed between them that if they were againunsuccessful they would turn their minds to other things.</p><p> "If we do not succeed this time we might as well count ourselves throughwith each other for good," she said one day in one of the fits of coldanger that were a part of child bearing with her.</p><p> That second night when Sam walked in the hospital corridor he was besidehimself. He felt like a young recruit called to face an unseen enemy andto stand motionless and inactive in the presence of the singing death thatran through the air. He remembered a story, told when he was a child by afellow soldier who had come to visit his father, of the prisoners atAndersonville creeping in the darkness past armed sentries to a littlepool of stagnant water beyond the dead line, and felt that he too wascreeping unarmed and helpless in the neighbourhood of death. In aconference at his house between the three some weeks before, it had beendecided, after tearful insistence on the part of Sue and a stand on thepart of Grover, who declared that he would not remain on the case unlesspermitted to use his own judgment, that an operation should be performed.</p><p> "Take the chances that need be taken," Sam had said to Grover after theconference; "she will never stand another defeat. Give her the child."</p><p> In the corridor it seemed to Sam that hours had passed and still he stoodmotionless waiting. His feet felt cold and he had the impression that theywere wet although the night was dry and a moon shone outside. When, from adistant part of the hospital, a groan reached his ears he shook withfright and had an inclination to cry out. Two young interns clad in whitepassed.</p><p> "Old Grover is doing a Caesarian section," said one of them; "he isgetting out of date. Hope he doesn't bungle it."</p><p> In Sam's ears rang the remembrance of Sue's voice, the Sue who that firsttime had gone into the room behind the swinging doors with the determinedsmile on her face. He thought he could see again the white face looking upfrom the wheeled cot on which they had taken her through the door.</p><p> "I am afraid, Dr. Grover--I am afraid I am unfit," he had heard her say asthe door closed.</p><p> And then Sam did a thing for which he cursed himself the rest of his life.On an impulse, and maddened by the intolerable waiting, he walked to theswinging doors and, pushing them open, stepped into the operating roomwhere Grover was at work upon Sue.</p><p> The room was long and narrow, with floors, walls and ceiling of whitecement. A great glaring light, suspended from the ceiling, threw its raysdirectly down on a white-clad figure lying on a white metal operatingtable. On the walls of the room were other glaring lights set in shiningglass reflectors. And, here and there through an intense, expectantatmosphere, moved and stood silently a group of men and women, faceless,hairless, with only their strangely vivid eyes showing through the whitemasks that covered their faces.</p><p> Sam, standing motionless by the door, looked about with wild, half-seeingeyes. Grover worked rapidly and silently, taking from time to time littleshining instruments from a swinging table close at his hand. The nursestanding beside him looked up toward the light and began calmly threadinga needle. And in a white basin on a little stand at the side of the roomlay the last of Sue's tremendous efforts toward new life, the last oftheir dreams of the great family.</p><p> Sam closed his eyes and fell. His head, striking against the wall, arousedhim and he struggled to his feet.</p><p> Without stopping his work, Grover began swearing.</p><p> "Damn it, man, get out of here."</p><p> Sam groped with his hand for the door. One of the white-clad, ghoulishfigures started toward him. And then with his head reeling and his eyesclosed he backed through the door and, running along the corridor and downa flight of broad stairs, reached the open air and darkness. He had nodoubt of Sue's death.</p><p> "She is gone," he muttered, hurrying bareheaded along the desertedstreets.</p><p> Through street after street he ran. Twice he came out upon the shores ofthe lake, and, then turning, went back into the heart of the city throughstreets bathed in the warm moonlight. Once he turned quickly at a cornerand stepping into a vacant lot stood behind a high board fence as apoliceman strolled along the street. Into his head came the idea that hehad killed Sue and that the blue-clad figure walking with heavy tread onthe stone pavement was seeking him to take him back to where she lay whiteand lifeless. Again he stopped, before a little frame drugstore on acorner, and sitting down on the steps before it cursed God openly anddefiantly like an angry boy defying his father. Some instinct led him tolook at the sky through the tangle of telegraph wires overhead.</p><p> "Go on and do what you dare!" he cried. "I will not follow you now. Ishall never try to find you after this."</p><p> Presently he began laughing at himself for the instinct that had led himto look at the sky and to shout out his defiance and, getting up, wanderedon. In his wanderings he came to a railroad track where a freight traingroaned and rattled over a crossing. When he came up to it he jumped uponan empty coal car, falling as he climbed, and cutting his face upon thesharp pieces of coal that lay scattered about the bottom of the car.</p><p> The train ground along slowly, stopping occasionally, the engine shriekinghysterically.</p><p> After a time he got out of the car and dropped to the ground. On all sidesof him were marshes, the long rank marsh grasses rolling and tossing inthe moonlight. When the train had passed he followed it, walkingstumblingly along. As he walked, following the blinking lights at the endof the train, he thought of the scene in the hospital and of Sue lyingdead for that--that ping livid and shapeless on the table under thelights.</p><p> Where the solid ground ran up to the tracks Sam sat down under a tree.Peace came over him. "This is the end of things," he thought, and was likea tired child comforted by its mother. He thought of the sweet-faced nursewho had walked with him that other time in the corridor of the hospitaland who had wept because of his fears, and then of the night when he hadfelt the throat of his father between his fingers in the squalid littlekitchen. He ran his hands along the ground. "Good old ground," he said. Asentence came into his mind followed by the figure of John Telferstriding, stick in hand, along a dusty road. "Here is spring come and timeto plant out flowers in the grass," he said aloud. His face felt swollenand sore from the fall in the freight car and he lay down on the groundunder a tree and slept.</p><p> When he woke it was morning and grey clouds were drifting across the sky.Within sight, down a road, a trolley car went past into the city. Beforehim, in the midst of the marsh, lay a low lake, and a raised walk, withboats tied to the posts on which it stood, ran down to the water. He wentdown the walk, bathed his bruised face in the water, and boarding a carwent back into the city.</p><p> In the morning air a new thought took possession of him. The wind ranalong a dusty road beside the car track, picking up little handfuls ofdust and playfully throwing them about. He had a strained, eager feelinglike some one listening for a faint call out of the distance.</p><p> "To be sure," he thought, "I know what it is, it is my wedding day. I amto marry Sue Rainey to-day."</p><p> At the house he found Grover and Colonel Tom standing in the breakfastroom. Grover looked at his swollen, distorted face. His voice trembled.</p><p> "Poor devil!" he said. "You have had a night!"</p><p> Sam laughed and slapped Colonel Tom on the shoulder.</p><p> "We will have to begin getting ready," he said. "The wedding is at ten.Sue will be getting anxious."</p><p> Grover and Colonel Tom took him by the arm and began leading him up thestairs, Colonel Tom weeping like a woman.</p><p> "Silly old fool," thought Sam.</p><p> When, two weeks later, he again opened his eyes to consciousness Sue satbeside his bed in a reclining chair, her little thin white hand in his.</p><p> "Get the baby!" he cried, believing anything possible. "I want to see thebaby!"</p><p> She laid her head down on the pillow.</p><p> "It was gone when you saw it," she said, and put an arm about his neck.</p><p> When the nurse came back she found them, their heads together upon thepillow, crying weakly like two tired children.</p><h2>Book II - Chapter 8</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> The blow given the plan of life so carefully thought out and so eagerlyaccepted by the young McPhersons threw them back upon themselves. Forseveral years they had been living upon a hill top, taking themselves veryseriously and more than a little preening themselves with the thought thatthey were two very unusual and thoughtful people engaged upon a worthy andennobling enterprise. Sitting in their corner immersed in admiration oftheir own purposes and in the thoughts of the vigorous, disciplined, newlife they were to give the world by the combined efficiency of their twobodies and minds they were, at a word and a shake of the head from DoctorGrover, compelled to remake the outline of their future together.</p><p> All about them the rush of life went on, vast changes were impending inthe industrial life of the people, cities were doubling and tripling theirpopulation, a war was being fought, and the flag of their country flew inthe ports of strange seas, while American boys pushed their way throughthe tangled jungles of strange lands carrying in their hands RaineyWhittaker rifles. And in a huge stone house, set in a broad expanse ofgreen lawns near the shores of Lake Michigan, Sam McPherson sat looking athis wife, who in turn looked at him. He was trying, as she also wastrying, to adjust himself to the cheerful acceptance of their new prospectof a childless life.</p><p> Looking at Sue across the dinner table or seeing her straight, wiry bodyastride a horse riding beside him through the parks, it seemed to Samunbelievable that a childless womanhood was ever to be her portion, andmore than once he had an inclination to venture again upon an effort forthe success of their hopes. But when he remembered her still white facethat night in the hospital, her bitter, haunting cry of defeat, he turnedwith a shudder from the thought, feeling that he could not go with heragain through that ordeal; that he could not again allow her to lookforward through weeks and months toward the little life that never came tolie upon her breast or to laugh up into her face.</p><p> And yet Sam, son of that Jane McPherson who had won the admiration of themen of Caxton by her ceaseless efforts to keep her family afloat and cleanhanded, could not sit idly by, living upon the income of his own and Sue'smoney. The stirring, forward-moving world called to him; he looked abouthim at the broad, significant movements in business and finance, at thenew men coming into prominence and apparently finding a way for theexpression of new big ideas, and felt his youth stirring in him and hismind reaching out to new projects and new ambitions.</p><p> Given the necessity for economy and a hard long-drawn-out struggle for alivelihood and competence, Sam could conceive of living his life with Sueand deriving something like gratification from just her companionship, andher partnership in his efforts--here and there during the waiting years hehad met men who had found such gratification--a foreman in the shops or atobacconist from whom he bought his cigars--but for himself he felt thathe had gone with Sue too far upon another road to turn that way now withanything like mutual zeal or interest. At bottom, his mind did not runstrongly toward the idea of the love of women as an end in life; he hadloved, and did love, Sue with something approaching religious fervour, butthe fervour was more than half due to the ideas she had given him and tothe fact that with him she was to have been the instrument for therealisation of those ideas. He was a man with children in his loins and hehad given up his struggles for business eminence for the sake of preparinghimself for a kind of noble fatherhood of children, many children, strongchildren, fit gifts to the world for two exceptionally favoured lives. Inall of his talks with Sue this idea had been present and dominant. He hadlooked about him and in the arrogance of his youth and in the pride of hisgood body and mind had condemned all childless marriages as a selfishwaste of good lives. With her he had agreed that such lives were withoutpoint and purpose. Now he remembered that in the days of her audacity anddaring she had more than once expressed the hope that in case of achildless issue to their marriage one or the other of them would have thecourage to cut the knot that tied them and venture into another effort atright living at any cost.</p><p> In the months after Sue's last recovery, and during the long evenings, asthey sat together or walked under the stars in the park, the thought ofthese talks was often in Sam's mind and he found himself beginning tospeculate on her present attitude and to wonder how bravely she would meetthe idea of a separation. In the end he decided that no such thought wasin her mind, that face to face with the tremendous actuality she clung tohim with a new dependence, and a new need of his companionship. Theconviction of the absolute necessity of children as a justification for aman and woman living together had, he thought, burned itself more deeplyinto his brain than into hers; to him it clung, coming back again andagain to his mind, causing him to turn here and there restlessly, makingreadjustments, seeking new light. The old gods being dead he sought newgods.</p><p> In the meantime he sat in his house facing his wife, losing himself in thebooks recommended to him years before by Janet, thinking his own thoughts.Often in the evening he would look up from his book or from hispreoccupied staring at the fire to find her eyes looking at him.</p><p> "Talk, Sam; talk," she would say; "do not sit there thinking."</p><p> Or at another time she would come to his room at night and putting herhead down on the pillow beside his would spend hours planning, weeping,begging him to give her again his love, his old fervent, devoted love.</p><p> This Sam tried earnestly and honestly to do, going with her for long walkswhen the new call, the business had begun to make to him, would have kepthim at his desk, reading aloud to her in the evening, urging her to shakeoff her old dreams and to busy herself with new work and new interests.</p><p> Through the days in the office he went in a kind of half stupor. An oldfeeling of his boyhood coming back to him, it seemed to him, as it hadseemed when he walked aimlessly through the streets of Caxton after thedeath of his mother, that there remained something to be done, anaccounting to be made. Even at his desk with the clatter of typewriters inhis ears and the piles of letters demanding his attention, his mindslipped back to the days of his courtship with Sue and to those days inthe north woods when life had beat strong within him, and every young,wild thing, every new growth renewed the dream that filled his being.Sometimes on the street, or walking in the park with Sue, the cries ofchildren at play cut across the sombre dulness of his mind and he shrankfrom the sound and a kind of bitter resentment took possession of him.When he looked covertly at Sue she talked of other things, apparentlyunconscious of his thoughts.</p><p> Then a new phase of life presented itself. To his surprise he foundhimself looking with more than passing interest at women in the streets,and an old hunger for the companionship of strange women came back to him,in some way coarsened and materialised. One evening at the theatre awoman, a friend of Sue's and the childless wife of a business friend ofhis own, sat beside him. In the darkness of the playhouse her shouldernestled down against his. In the excitement of a crisis on the stage herhand slipped into his and her fingers clutched and held his fingers.</p><p> Animal desire seized and shook him, a feeling without sweetness, brutal,making his eyes burn. When between the acts the theatre was again floodedwith light he looked up guiltily to meet another pair of eyes equallyfilled with guilty hunger. A challenge had been given and received.</p><p> In their car, homeward bound, Sam put the thoughts of the woman away fromhim and taking Sue in his arms prayed silently for some help against heknew not what.</p><p> "I think I will go to Caxton in the morning and have a talk with MaryUnderwood," he said.</p><p> After his return from Caxton Sam set about finding some new interest tooccupy Sue's mind. He had spent an afternoon talking to Valmore, FreedomSmith, and Telfer and thought there was a kind of flatness in their jokesand in their ageing comments on each other. Then he had gone from them forhis talk with Mary. Half through the night they had talked, Sam gettingforgiveness for not writing and getting also a long friendly lecture onhis duty toward Sue. He thought she had in some way missed the point. Shehad seemed to suppose that the loss of the children had fallen singly uponSue. She had not counted upon him, and he had depended upon her doing justthat. He had come as a boy to his mother wanting to talk of himself andshe had wept at the thought of the childless wife and had told him how toset about making her happy.</p><p> "Well, I will set about it," he thought on the train coming home; "I willfind for her this new interest and make her less dependent upon me. Then Ialso will take hold anew and work out for myself a programme for a way oflife."</p><p> One afternoon when he came home from the office he found Sue filled indeedwith a new idea. With glowing cheeks she sat beside him through theevening and talked of the beauties of a life devoted to social service.</p><p> "I have been thinking things out," she said, her eyes shining. "We mustnot allow ourselves to become sordid. We must keep to the vision. We musttogether give the best in our lives and our fortunes to mankind. We mustmake ourselves units in the great modern movements for social uplift."</p><p> Sam looked at the fire and a chill feeling of doubt ran through him. Hecould not see himself as a unit in anything. His mind did not run outtoward the thought of being one of the army of philanthropists or richsocial uplifters he had met talking and explaining in the reading rooms ofclubs. No answering flame burned in his heart as it had burned thatevening by the bridle path in Jackson Park when she had expounded anotheridea. But the thought of a need of new interest for her coming to him, heturned to her smiling.</p><p> "It sounds all right but I know nothing of such things," he said.</p><p> After that evening Sue began to get a hold upon herself. The old fire cameback into her eyes and she went about the house with a smile upon her faceand talked through the evenings to her silent, attentive husband of thelife of usefulness, the full life. One day she told him of her election tothe presidency of a society for the rescue of fallen women, and he beganseeing her name in the newspapers in connection with various charity andcivic movements. At the house a new sort of men and women began appearingat the dinner table; a strangely earnest, feverish, half fanatical people,Sam thought, with an inclination toward corsetless dresses and uncut hair,who talked far into the night and worked themselves into a sort ofreligious zeal over what they called their movement. Sam found them likelyto run to startling statements, noticed that they sat on the edges oftheir chairs when they talked, and was puzzled by their tendency towardmaking the most revolutionary statements without pausing to back them up.When he questioned a statement made by one of these people, he came downupon him with a rush that quite carried him away and then, turning to theothers, looked at them wisely like a cat that has swallowed a mouse. "Askus another question if you dare," their faces seemed to be saying, whiletheir tongues declared that they were but students of the great problem ofright living.</p><p> With these new people Sam never made any progress toward realunderstanding and friendship. For a time he tried honestly to get some oftheir own fervent devotions to their ideas and to be impressed by whatthey said of their love of man, even going with them to some of theirmeetings, at one of which he sat among the fallen women gathered in, andlistened to a speech by Sue.</p><p> The speech did not make much of a hit, the fallen women moving restlesslyabout. A large woman, with an immense nose, did better. She talked with aswift, contagious zeal that was very stirring, and, listening to her, Samwas reminded of the evening when he sat before another zealous talker inthe church at Caxton and Jim Williams, the barber, tried to stampede himinto the fold with the lambs. While the woman talked a plump little memberof the _demi monde_ who sat beside Sam wept copiously, but at the end ofthe speech he could remember nothing of what had been said and he wonderedif the weeping woman would remember.</p><p> To express his determination to continue being Sue's companion andpartner, Sam during one winter taught a class of young men at a settlementhouse in the factory district of the west side. The class in his hands wasunsuccessful. He found the young men heavy and stupid with fatigue afterthe day of labour in the shops and more inclined to fall asleep in theirchairs, or wander away, one at a time, to loaf and smoke on a nearbycorner, than to stay in the room listening to the man reading or talkingbefore them.</p><p> When one of the young women workers came into the room, they sat up andseemed for the moment interested. Once Sam heard a group of them talkingof these women workers on a landing in a darkened stairway. The experiencestartled Sam and he dropped the class, admitting to Sue his failure andhis lack of interest and bowing his head before her accusation of a lackof the love of men.</p><p> Later by the fire in his own room he tried to draw for himself a moralfrom the experience.</p><p> "Why should I love these men?" he asked himself. "They are what I mighthave been. Few of the men I have known have loved me and some of the bestand cleanest of them have worked vigorously for my defeat. Life is abattle in which few men win and many are defeated and in which hate andfear play their part with love and generosity. These heavy-featured youngmen are a part of the world as men have made it. Why this protest againsttheir fate when we are all of us making more and more of them with everyturn of the clock?"</p><p> During the next year, after the fiasco of the settlement house class, Samfound himself drifting more and more rapidly away from Sue and her newviewpoint of life. The growing gulf between them showed itself in athousand little household acts and impulses, and every time he looked ather he thought her more apart from him and less a part of the real lifethat went on within him. In the old days there had been something intimateand familiar in her person and in her presence. She had seemed like a partof him, like the room in which he slept or the coat he wore on his back,and he had looked into her eyes as thoughtlessly and with as little fearof what he might find there as he looked at his own hands. Now when hiseyes met hers they dropped, and one or the other of them began talkinghurriedly like a person who has a consciousness of something he mustconceal.</p><p> Down town Sam took up anew his old friendship and intimacy with JackPrince, going with him to clubs and drinking places and often spendingevenings among the clever, money-wasting young men who laughed and madedeals and talked their way through life at Jack's side. Among these youngmen a business associate of Jack's caught his attention and in a few weeksan intimacy had sprung up between Sam and this man.</p><p> Maurice Morrison, Sam's new friend, had been discovered by Jack Princeworking as a sub-editor on a country daily down the state. There was, Samthought, something of the Caxton dandy, Mike McCarthy, in the man,combined with prolonged and fervent, although somewhat periodic attacks ofindustry. In his youth he had written poetry and at one time had studiedfor the ministry, and in Chicago, under Jack Prince, he had developed intoa money maker and led the life of a talented, rather unscrupulous man ofthe world. He kept a mistress, often overdrank, and Sam thought him themost brilliant and convincing talker he had ever heard. As Jack Prince'sassistant he had charge of the Rainey Company's large advertisingexpenditure, and the two men being thrown often together a mutual regardgrew up between them. Sam believed him to be without moral sense; he knewhim to be able and honest and he found in the association with him a fundof odd little sweetnesses of character and action that lent aninexpressible charm to the person of his friend.</p><p> It was through Morrison that Sam had his first serious misunderstandingwith Sue. One evening the brilliant young advertising man dined at theMcPhersons'. The table, as usual, was filled with Sue's new friends, amongthem a tall, gaunt man who, with the arrival of the coffee, began in ahigh-pitched, earnest voice to talk of the coming social revolution. Samlooked across the table and saw a light dancing in Morrison's eyes. Like ahound unleashed he sprang among Sue's friends, tearing the rich to pieces,calling for the onward advance of the masses, quoting odds and ends ofShelley and Carlyle, peering earnestly up and down the table, and at theend quite winning the hearts of the women by a defence of fallen womenthat stirred the blood of even his friend and host.</p><p> Sam was amused and a trifle annoyed. The whole thing was, he knew, no morethan a piece of downright acting with just the touch of sincerity in itthat was characteristic of the man but that had no depth or real meaning.During the rest of the evening he watched Sue, wondering if she too hadfathomed Morrison and what she thought of his having taken the role ofstar from the long gaunt man, who had evidently been booked for that partand who sat at the table and wandered afterward among the guests, annoyedand disconcerted.</p><p> Late that night Sue came into his room and found him reading and smokingby the fire.</p><p> "Cheeky of Morrison, dimming your star," he said, looking at her andlaughing apologetically.</p><p> Sue looked at him doubtfully.</p><p> "I came in to thank you for bringing him," she said; "I thought himsplendid."</p><p> Sam looked at her and for a moment was tempted to let the matter pass. Andthen his old inclination to be always open and frank with her asserteditself and he closed the book and rising stood looking down at her.</p><p> "The little beast was guying your crowd," he said, "but I do not want himto guy you. Not that he wouldn't try. He has the audacity for anything."</p><p> A flush arose to her cheeks and her eyes gleamed.</p><p> "That is not true, Sam," she said coldly. "You say that because you arebecoming hard and cold and cynical. Your friend Morrison talked from hisheart. It was beautiful. Men like you, who have a strong influence overhim, may lead him away, but in the end a man like that will come to givehis life to the service of society. You should help him; not assume anattitude of unbelief and laugh at him."</p><p> Sam stood upon the hearth smoking his pipe and looking at her. He wasthinking how easy it would have been in the first year after theirmarriage to have explained Morrison. Now he felt that he was but making abad matter worse, but went on determined to stick to his policy of beingentirely honest with her.</p><p> "Look here, Sue," he began quietly, "be a good sport. Morrison was joking.I know the man. He is the friend of men like me because he wants to be andbecause it pays him to be. He is a talker, a writer, a talented,unscrupulous word-monger. He is making a big salary by taking the ideas ofmen like me and expressing them better than we can ourselves. He is a goodworkman and a generous, open-hearted fellow with a lot of nameless charmin him, but a man of convictions he is not. He could talk tears into theeyes of your fallen women, but he would be a lot more likely to talk goodwomen into their state."</p><p> Sam put a hand upon her shoulder.</p><p> "Be sensible and do not be offended," he went on: "take the fellow forwhat he is and be glad for him. He hurts little and cheers a lot. He couldmake a convincing argument in favour of civilisation's return tocannibalism, but really, you know, he spends most of his time thinking andwriting of washing machines and ladies' hats and liver pills, and most ofhis eloquence after all only comes down to 'Send for catalogue, DepartmentK' in the end."</p><p> Sue's voice was colourless with passion when she replied.</p><p> "This is unbearable. Why did you bring the fellow here?"</p><p> Sam sat down and picked up his book. In his impatience he lied to her forthe first time since their marriage.</p><p> "First, because I like him and second, because I wanted to see if Icouldn't produce a man who could outsentimentalise your socialistfriends," he said quietly.</p><p> Sue turned and walked out of the room. In a way the action was final andmarked the end of understanding between them. Putting down his book Samwatched her go and some feeling he had kept for her and that haddifferentiated her from all other women died in him as the door closedbetween them. Throwing the book aside he sprang to his feet and stoodlooking at the door.</p><p> "The old goodfellowship appeal is dead," he thought. "From now on we willhave to explain and apologise like two strangers. No more taking eachother for granted."</p><p> Turning out the light he sat again before the fire to think his waythrough the situation that faced him. He had no thought that she wouldreturn. That last shot of his own had crushed the possibility of that.</p><p> The fire was getting low in the grate and he did not renew it. He lookedpast it toward the darkened windows and heard the hum of motor cars alongthe boulevard below. Again he was the boy of Caxton hungrily seeking anend in life. The flushed face of the woman in the theatre danced beforehis eyes. He remembered with shame how he had, a few days before, stood ina doorway and followed with his eyes the figure of a woman who had liftedher eyes to him as they passed in the street. He wished that he might goout of the house for a walk with John Telfer and have his mind filled witheloquence of the standing corn, or sit at the feet of Janet Eberly as shetalked of books and of life. He got up and turning on the lights beganpreparing for bed.</p><p> "I know what I will do," he said, "I will go to work. I will do some realwork and make some more money. That's the place for me."</p><p> And to work he went, real work, the most sustained and clearly thought-outwork he had done. For two years he was out of the house at dawn for a longbracing walk in the fresh morning air, to be followed by eight, ten andeven fifteen hours in the office and shops; hours in which he drove theRainey Arms Company's organisation mercilessly and, taking openly everyvestige of the management out of the hands of Colonel Tom, began the plansfor the consolidation of the American firearms companies that later puthis name on the front pages of the newspapers and got him the title of aCaptain of Finance.</p><p> There is a widespread misunderstanding abroad regarding the motives ofmany of the American millionaires who sprang into prominence and affluencein the days of change and sudden bewildering growth that followed theclose of the Spanish War. They were, many of them, not of the brute tradertype, but were, instead, men who thought and acted quickly and with adaring and audacity impossible to the average mind. They wanted power andwere, many of them, entirely unscrupulous, but for the most part they weremen with a fire burning within them, men who became what they were becausethe world offered them no better outlet for their vast energies.</p><p> Sam McPherson had been untiring and without scruples in the first hard,quick struggle to get his head above the great unknown body of men therein the city. He had turned aside from money getting when he heard what hetook to be a call to a better way of life. Now with the fires of youthstill in him and with the training and discipline that had come from twoyears of reading, of comparative leisure and of thought, he was preparedto give the Chicago business world a display of that tremendous energythat was to write his name in the industrial history of the city as one ofthe first of the western giants of finance.</p><p> Going to Sue, Sam told her frankly of his plans.</p><p> "I want a free hand in the handling of your stock in the company," hesaid. "I cannot lead this new life of yours. It may help and sustain youbut it gets no hold on me. I want to be myself now and lead my own life inmy own way. I want to run the company, really run it. I cannot stand idlyby and let life go past. I am hurting myself and you standing here lookingon. Also I am in a kind of danger of another kind that I want to avoid bythrowing myself into hard, constructive work."</p><p> Without question Sue signed the papers he brought her. A flash of her oldfrankness toward him came back.</p><p> "I do not blame you, Sam," she said, smiling bravely. "Things have notgone right, as we both know, but if we cannot work together at least letus not hurt each other."</p><p> When Sam returned to give himself again to affairs, the country was justat the beginning of the great wave of consolidation which was finally tosweep all of the financial power of the country into a dozen pairs ofcompetent and entirely efficient hands. With the sure instinct of the borntrader Sam had seen this movement coming and had studied it. Now he beganto act. Going to that same swarthy-faced lawyer who had drawn the contractfor him to secure control of the medical student's twenty thousand dollarsand who had jokingly invited him to become one of a band of train robbers,he told him of his plans to begin working toward a consolidation of allthe firearms companies of the country.</p><p> Webster wasted no time in joking now. He laid out the plans, adjusted andreadjusted them to suit Sam's shrewd suggestions, and when a fee wasmentioned shook his head.</p><p> "I want in on this," he said. "You will need me. I am made for this gameand have been waiting for a chance to get at it. Just count me in as oneof the promoters if you will."</p><p> Sam nodded his head. Within a week he had formed a pool of his owncompany's stock controlling, as he thought, a safe majority and had begunworking to form a similar pool in the stock of his only big western rival.</p><p> This last job was not an easy one. Lewis, the Jew, had been makingconstant headway in that company just as Sam had made headway in theRainey Company. He was a money maker, a sales manager of rare ability,and, as Sam knew, a planner and executor of business coups of the firstclass.</p><p> Sam did not want to deal with Lewis. He had respect for the man's abilityin driving sharp bargains and felt that he would like to have the whip inhis own hands when it came to the point of dealing with him. To this endhe began visiting bankers and the men who were head of big western trustcompanies in Chicago and St. Louis. He went about his work slowly, feelinghis way and trying to get at each man by some effective appeal, buying theuse of vast sums of money by a promise of common stock, the bait of a bigactive bank account, and, here and there, by the hint of a directorship inthe big new consolidated company.</p><p> For a time the project moved slowly; indeed there were weeks and monthswhen it did not appear to move at all. Working in secret and with extremecaution Sam encountered many discouragements and went home in the eveningday after day to sit among Sue's guests with a mind filled with his ownplans and with an indifferent ear turned to the talk of revolution, socialunrest, and the new class consciousness of the masses, that rattled andcrackled up and down his dinner table. He thought that it must be tryingto Sue. He was so evidently not interested in her interests. At the sametime he thought that he was working toward what he wanted out of life andwent to bed at night believing that he was finding, and would find, a kindof peace in just thinking clearly along one line day after day.</p><p> One day Webster, who had wanted to be in on the deal, came to Sam's officeand gave his project its first great boost toward success. He, like Sam,thought he saw clearly the tendencies of the times, and was greedy for theblock of common stock that Sam had promised should come to him with thecompletion of the enterprise.</p><p> "You are not using me," he said, sitting down before Sam's desk. "What isblocking the deal?"</p><p> Sam began to explain and when he had finished Webster laughed.</p><p> "Let's get at Tom Edwards of the Edward Arms Company direct," he said, andthen, leaning over the desk, "Edwards is a vain little peacock and asecond rate business man," he declared emphatically. "Get him afraid andthen flatter his vanity. He has a new wife with blonde hair and big softblue eyes. He wants prominence. He is afraid to venture upon big thingshimself but is hungry for the reputation and gain that comes through bigdeals. Use the method the Jew has used; show him what it means to theyellow-haired woman to be the wife of the president of the bigconsolidated Arms Company. THE EDWARDS CONSOLIDATED, eh? Get at Edwards.Bluff him and flatter him and he is your man."</p><p> Sam wondered. Edwards was a small grey-haired man of sixty with somethingdry and unresponsive about him. Being a silent man, he had created animpression of remarkable shrewdness and ability. After a lifetime spent inhard labour and in the practice of the most rigid economy he had come upto wealth, and had got into the firearms business through Lewis, and itwas counted one of the brightest stars in that brilliant Hebrew's crownthat he had been able to lead Edwards with him in his daring and audacioushandling of the company's affairs.</p><p> Sam looked at Webster across the desk and thought of Tom Edwards as thefigurehead of the firearms trust.</p><p> "I was saving the frosting on the cake for my own Tom," he said; "it was athing I wanted to hand the colonel."</p><p> "Let us see Edwards this evening," said Webster dryly.</p><p> Sam nodded, and late that night made the deal that gave him control of thetwo important western companies and put him in position to move on theeastern companies with every prospect of complete success. To Edwards hewent with an exaggerated report of the support he had already got for hisproject, and having frightened him offered him the presidency of the newcompany and promised that it should be incorporated under the name of TheEdwards Consolidated Firearms Company of America.</p><p> The eastern companies fell quickly. With Webster Sam tried on them the olddodge of telling each that the other two had agreed to come in, and itworked.</p><p> With the coming in of Edwards and the options given by the easterncompanies Sam began to get also the support of the LaSalle Street bankers.The firearms trust was one of the few big consolidations managed wholly inthe west, and after two or three of the bankers had agreed to help financeSam's plan the others began asking to be taken into the underwritingsyndicate he and Webster had formed. Within thirty days after the closingof the deal with Tom Edwards Sam felt that he was ready to act.</p><p> For several months Colonel Tom had known something of the plans Sam had onfoot, and had made no protest. He had in fact given Sam to understand thathis stock would be voted with Sue's, controlled by Sam, and with the stockof the other directors who knew of and hoped to share in the profits ofSam's deal. The old gunmaker had all of his life believed that the otherAmerican firearms companies were but shadows destined to disappear beforethe rising sun of the Rainey Company, and thought of Sam's project as anact of providence to further this desirable end.</p><p> At the moment of his acquiescence in Webster's plan, for landing TomEdwards, Sam had a moment of doubt, and now, with the success of hisproject in sight, he began to wonder how the blustering old man would lookupon Edwards as the titular head of the big company and upon the name ofEdwards in the title of the company.</p><p> For two years Sam had seen little of the colonel, who had given up allpretence to an active part in the management of the business and who,finding Sue's new friends disconcerting, seldom appeared at the house,living at the clubs, playing billiards all day long, or sitting in theclub windows boasting to chance listeners of his part in the building ofthe Rainey Arms Company.</p><p> With a mind filled with doubt Sam went home and put the matter before Sue.She was dressed and ready for an evening at the theatre with a party offriends and the talk was brief.</p><p> "He will not mind," she said indifferently. "Go ahead and do what you wantto do."</p><p> Sam rode back to the office and called his lieutenants about him. He feltthat the thing might as well be done and over, and with the options in hishands, and the ability he thought he had to control his own company, hewas ready to come out into the open and get the deal cleaned up.</p><p> The morning papers that carried the story of the proposed big newconsolidation of firearms companies carried also an almost life-sizehalftone of Colonel Tom Rainey, a slightly smaller one of Tom Edwards, andgrouped about these, small pictures of Sam, Lewis, Prince, Webster, andseveral of the eastern men. By the size of the half-tone, Sam, Prince, andMorrison had tried to reconcile Colonel Tom to Edwards' name in the titleof the new company and to Edwards' coming election as president. The storyalso played up the past glories of the Rainey Company and its directinggenius, Colonel Tom. One phrase, written by Morrison, brought a smile toSam's lips.</p><p> "This grand old patriarch of American business, retired now from activeservice, is like a tired giant, who, having raised a brood of younggiants, goes into his castle to rest and reflect and to count the scarswon in many a hard-fought battle."</p><p> Morrison laughed as he read it aloud.</p><p> "It ought to get the colonel," he said, "but the newspaper man who printsit should be hung."</p><p> "They will print it all right," said Jack Prince.</p><p> And they did print it; going from newspaper office to newspaper officePrince and Morrison saw to that, using their influence as big buyers ofadvertising space and even insisting upon reading proof on their ownmasterpiece.</p><p> But it did not work. Early the next morning Colonel Tom appeared at theoffices of the arms company with blood in his eye, and swore that theconsolidation should not be put through. For an hour he stormed up anddown in Sam's office, his outbursts of wrath varied by periods ofchildlike pleading for the retention of the name and glory of the Raineys.When Sam shook his head and went with the old man to the meeting that wasto pass upon his action and sell the Rainey Company, he knew that he had afight on his hands.</p><p> The meeting was a stormy one. Sam made a talk telling what had been doneand Webster, voting some of Sam's proxies, made a motion that Sam's offerfor the old company be accepted.</p><p> And then Colonel Tom fired his guns. Walking up and down in the roombefore the men, sitting at a long table or in chairs tilted against thewalls, he began talking with all of his old flamboyant pomposity of thepast glories of the Rainey Company. Sam watched him quietly thinking ofthe exhibition as something detached and apart from the business of themeeting. He remembered a question that had come into his head when he wasa schoolboy and had got his first peep into a school history. There hadbeen a picture of Indians at the war dance and he had wondered why theydanced before rather than after battle. Now his mind answered thequestion.</p><p> "If they had not danced before they might never have got the chance," hethought, and smiled to himself.</p><p> "I call upon you men here to stick to the old colours," roared thecolonel, turning and making a direct attack upon Sam. "Do not let thisungrateful upstart, this son of a drunken village housepainter, that Ipicked up from among the cabbages of South Water Street, win you away fromyour loyalty to the old leader. Do not let him steal by trickery what wehave won only by years of effort."</p><p> The colonel, leaning on the table, glared about the room. Sam feltrelieved and glad of the direct attack.</p><p> "It justifies what I am going to do," he thought.</p><p> When Colonel Tom had finished Sam gave a careless glance at the old man'sred face and trembling fingers. He had no doubt that the outburst ofeloquence had fallen upon deaf ears and without comment put Webster'smotion to the vote.</p><p> To his surprise two of the new employ directors voted their stock withColonel Tom's, and a third man, voting his own stock as well as that of awealthy southside real estate man, did not vote. On a count the stockrepresented stood deadlocked and Sam, looking down the table, raised hiseyebrows to Webster.</p><p> "Move we adjourn for twenty-four hours," snapped Webster, and the motioncarried.</p><p> Sam looked at a paper lying before him on the table. During the count ofthe vote he had been writing over and over on the sheet of paper thissentence.</p><p> "The best men spend their lives seeking truth."</p><p> Colonel Tom walked out of the room like a conqueror, declining to speak toSam as he passed, and Sam looked down the table at Webster and made amotion with his head toward the man who had not voted.</p><p> Within an hour Sam's fight was won. Pouncing upon the man representing thestock of the south-side investor, he and Webster did not go out of theroom until they had secured absolute control of the Rainey Company and theman who had refused to vote had put twenty-five thousand dollars into hispocket. The two employe directors Sam marked for slaughter. Then afterspending the afternoon and early evening with the representatives of theeastern companies and their attorneys he drove home to Sue.</p><p> It was past nine o'clock when his car stopped before the house and, goingat once to his room, he found Sue sitting before his fire, her arms thrownabove her head and her eyes staring at the burning coals.</p><p> As Sam stood in the doorway looking at her a wave of resentment swept overhim.</p><p> "The old coward," he thought, "he has brought our fight here to her."</p><p> Hanging up his coat he filled his pipe and drawing up a chair sat besideher. For five minutes Sue sat staring into the fire. When she spoke therewas a touch of hardness in her voice.</p><p> "When everything is said, Sam, you do owe a lot to father," she observed,refusing to look at him.</p><p> Sam said nothing and she went on.</p><p> "Not that I think we made you, father and I. You are not the kind of manthat people make or unmake. But, Sam, Sam, think what you are doing. Hehas always been a fool in your hands. He used to come home here when youwere new with the company and talk of what he was doing. He had a wholenew set of ideas and phrases; all that about waste and efficiency andorderly working toward a definite end. It did not fool me. I knew theideas, and even the phrases he used to express them, were not his and Iwas not long finding out they were yours, that it was simply youexpressing yourself through him. He is a big helpless child, Sam, and heis old. He hasn't much longer to live. Do not be hard, Sam. Be merciful."</p><p> Her voice did not tremble but tears ran down her rigid face and herexpressive hands clutched at her dress.</p><p> "Can nothing change you? Must you always have your own way?" she added,still refusing to look at him.</p><p> "It is not true, Sue, that I always want my own way, and people do changeme; you have changed me," he said.</p><p> She shook her head.</p><p> "No, I have not changed you. I found you hungry for something and youthought I could feed it. I gave you an idea that you took hold of and madeyour own. I do not know where I got it, from some book or hearing some onetalk, I suppose. But it belonged to you. You built it and fostered it inme and coloured it with your own personality. It is your idea to-day. Itmeans more to you than all this firearms trust that the papers are fullof."</p><p> She turned to look at him, and put out her hand and laid it in his.</p><p> "I have not been brave," she said. "I am standing in your way. I have hada hope that we would get back to each other. I should have freed you but Ihadn't the courage, I hadn't the courage. I could not give up the dreamthat some day you would really take me back to you."</p><p> Getting out of her chair she dropped to her knees and putting her head inhis lap, shook with sobs. Sam sat stroking her hair. Her agitation was sogreat that her muscular little back shook with it.</p><p> Sam looked past her at the fire and tried to think clearly. He was notgreatly moved by her agitation, but with all his heart he wanted to thinkthings out and get at the right and the honest thing to do.</p><p> "It is a time of big things," he said slowly and with an air of oneexplaining to a child. "As your socialists say, vast changes are going on.I do not believe that your socialists really sense what these changesmean, and I am not sure that I do or that any man does, but I know theymean something big and I want to be in them and a part of them; all bigmen do; they are struggling like chicks in the shell. Why, look here! WhatI am doing has to be done and if I do not do it another man will. Thecolonel has to go. He will be swept aside. He belongs to something old andoutworn. Your socialists, I believe, call it the age of competition."</p><p> "But not by us, not by you, Sam," she plead. "After all, he is my father."</p><p> A stern look came into Sam's eyes.</p><p> "It does not ring right, Sue," he said coldly; "fathers do not mean muchto me. I choked my own father and threw him into the street when I wasonly a boy. You knew about that. You heard of it when you went to find outabout me that time in Caxton. Mary Underwood told you. I did it because helied and believed in lies. Do not your friends say that the individual whostands in the way should be crushed?"</p><p> She sprang to her feet and stood before him.</p><p> "Do not quote that crowd," she burst out. "They are not the real thing. Doyou suppose I do not know that? Do I not know that they come here becausethey hope to get hold of you? Haven't I watched them and seen the look ontheir faces when you have not come or have not listened to their talk?They are afraid of you, all of them. That's why they talk so bitterly.They are afraid and ashamed that they are afraid."</p><p> "Like the workers in the shop?" he asked, musingly.</p><p> "Yes, like that, and like me since I failed in my part of our lives andhad not the courage to get out of the way. You are worth all of us and forall our talk we shall never succeed or begin to succeed until we make menlike you want what we want. They know that and I know it."</p><p> "And what do you want?"</p><p> "I want you to be big and generous. You can be. Failure cannot hurt you.You and men like you can do anything. You can even fail. I cannot. None ofus can. I cannot put my father to that shame. I want you to acceptfailure."</p><p> Sam got up and taking her by the arm led her to the door. At the door heturned her about and kissed her on the lips like a lover.</p><p> "All right, Sue girl, I will do it," he said, and pushed her through thedoor. "Now let me sit down by myself and think things out."</p><p> It was a night in September and a whisper of the coming frost was in theair. He threw up the window and took long breaths of the sharp air andlistened to the rumble of the elevated road in the distance. Looking upthe boulevard he saw the lights of the cyclists making a glistening streamthat flowed past the house. A thought of his new motor car and of all ofthe wonder of the mechanical progress of the world ran through his mind.</p><p> "The men who make machines do not hesitate," he said to himself; "eventhough a thousand fat-hearted men stood in their way they would go on."</p><p> A line of Tennyson's came into his mind.</p><p> "And the nation's airy navies grappling in the central blue," he quoted,thinking of an article he had read predicting the coming of airships.</p><p> He thought of the lives of the workers in steel and iron and of the thingsthey had done and would do.</p><p> "They have," he thought, "freedom. Steel and iron do not run home to carrythe struggle to women sitting by the fire."</p><p> He walked up and down the room.</p><p> "Fat old coward. Damned fat old coward," he muttered over and over tohimself.</p><p> It was past midnight when he got into bed and began trying to quiethimself for sleep. In his dreams he saw a fat man with a chorus girlhanging to his arm kicking his head about a bridge above a swiftly flowingstream.</p><p> When he got down to the breakfast room the next morning Sue had gone. Byhis plate he found a note saying that she had gone for Colonel Tom andwould take him to the country for the day. He walked to the officethinking of the incapable old man who, in the name of sentiment, hadbeaten him in what he thought the big enterprise of his life.</p><p> At his desk he found a message from Webster. "The old turkey cock hasfled," it said; "we should have saved the twenty-five thousand."</p><p> On the phone Webster told Sam of an early visit to the club to see ColonelTom and that the old man had left the city, going to the country for theday. It was on Sam's lips to tell of his changed plans but he hesitated.</p><p> "I will see you at your office in an hour," he said.</p><p> Outside again in the open air Sam walked and thought of his promise. Downby the lake he went to where the railroad with the lake beyond stoppedhim. Upon the old wooden bridge looking over the track and down to thewater he stood as he had stood at other crises in his life and thoughtover the struggle of the night before. In the clear morning air, with theroar of the city behind him and the still waters of the lake in front, thetears, and the talk with Sue seemed but a part of the ridiculous andsentimental attitude of her father, and the promise given herinsignificant and unfairly won. He reviewed the scene carefully, the talkand the tears and the promise given as he led her to the door. It allseemed far away and unreal like some promise made to a girl in hisboyhood.</p><p> "It was never a part of all this," he said, turning and looking at thetowering city before him.</p><p> For an hour he stood on the wooden bridge. He thought of Windy McPhersonputting the bugle to his lips in the streets of Caxton and again theresounded in his ears the roaring laugh of the crowd; again he lay in thebed beside Colonel Tom in that northern city and saw the moon rising overthe round paunch and heard the empty chattering talk of love.</p><p> "Love," he said, still looking toward the city, "is a matter of truth, notlies and pretence."</p><p> Suddenly it seemed to him that if he went forward truthfully he should geteven Sue back again some time. His mind lingered over the thoughts of theloves that come to a man in the world, of Sue in the wind-swept northernwoods and of Janet in her wheel-chair in the little room where the cablecars ran rumbling under the window. And he thought of other things, of Suereading papers culled out of books before the fallen women in the littleState Street hall, of Tom Edwards with his new wife and his little wateryeyes, of Morrison and the long-fingered socialist fighting over words athis table. And then pulling on his gloves he lighted a cigar and went backthrough the crowded streets to his office to do the thing he haddetermined on.</p><p> At the meeting that afternoon the project went through without adissenting voice. Colonel Tom being absent, the two employ directorsvoted with Sam with almost panicky haste as Sam looking across at thewell-dressed, cool-headed Webster, laughed and lighted a fresh cigar. Andthen he voted the stock Sue had intrusted to him for the project, feelingthat in doing so he was cutting, perhaps for all time, the knot that boundthem.</p><p> With the completion of the deal Sam stood to win five million dollars,more money than Colonel Tom or any of the Raineys had ever controlled, andhad placed himself in the eyes of the business men of Chicago and New Yorkwhere before he had placed himself in the eyes of Caxton and South WaterStreet. Instead of another Windy McPherson failing to blow his buglebefore the waiting crowd, he was still the man who made good, the man whoachieved, the kind of man of whom America boasts before the world.</p><p> He did not see Sue again. When the news of his betrayal reached her shewent off east taking Colonel Tom with her, and Sam closed the house, evensending a man there for his clothes. To her eastern address, got from herattorney, he wrote a brief note offering to make over to her or to ColonelTom his entire winnings from the deal and closed it with the brutaldeclaration, "At the end I could not be an ass, even for you."</p><p> To this note Sam got a cold, brief reply telling him to dispose of herstock in the company and of that belonging to Colonel Tom, and naming aneastern trust company to receive the money. With Colonel Tom's help shehad made a careful estimate of the values of their holdings at the time ofconsolidation and refused flatly to accept a penny beyond that amount.</p><p> Sam felt that another chapter of his life was closed. Webster, Edwards,Prince, and the eastern men met and elected him chairman of the board ofdirectors of the new company and the public bought eagerly the river ofcommon stock he turned upon the market, Prince and Morrison doingmasterful work in the moulding of public opinion through the press. Thefirst board meeting ended with a dinner at which wine flowed in rivuletsand Edwards, getting drunk, stood up at his place and boasted of thebeauty of his young wife. And Sam, at his desk in his new offices in theRookery, settled down grimly to the playing of his role as one of the newkings of American business.</p><h2>Book II - Chapter 9</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> The story of Sam's life there in Chicago for the next several years ceasesto be the story of a man and becomes the story of a type, a crowd, a gang.What he and the group of men surrounding him and making money with him didin Chicago, other men and other groups of men have done in New York, inParis, in London. Coming into power with the great expansive wave ofprosperity that attended the first McKinley administration, these men wentmad of money making. They played with great industrial institutions andrailroad systems like excited children, and a man of Chicago won thenotice and something of the admiration of the world by his willingness tobet a million dollars on the turn of the weather. In the years ofcriticism and readjustment that followed this period of sporadic growth,writers have told with great clearness how the thing was done, and some ofthe participants, captains of industry turned penmen, Caesars become inkslingers, have bruited the story to an admiring world.</p><p> Given the time, the inclination, the power of the press, and theunscrupulousness, the thing that Sam McPherson and his followers did inChicago in not difficult. Advised by Webster and the talented Prince andMorrison to handle his publicity work, he rapidly unloaded his hugeholdings of common stock upon an eager public, keeping for himself thebonds which he hypothecated at the banks to increase his working capitalwhile continuing to control the company. When the common stock wasunloaded, he, with a group of fellow spirits, began an attack upon itthrough the stock market and in the press, and bought it again at a lowfigure, holding it ready to unload when the public should have forgotten.</p><p> The annual advertising expenditure of the firearms trust ran into millionsand Sam's hold upon the press of the country was almost unbelievablystrong. Morrison rapidly developed unusual daring and audacity in usingthis instrument and making it serve Sam's ends. He suppressed facts,created illusions, and used the newspapers as a whip to crack at the heelsof congressmen, senators, and legislators, of the various states, whensuch matters as appropriation for firearms came before them.</p><p> And Sam, who had undertaken the consolidation of the firearms companies,having a dream of himself as a great master in that field, a sort ofAmerican Krupp, rapidly awoke from the dream to take the bigger chancesfor gain in the world of speculation. Within a year he dropped Edwards ashead of the firearms trust and in his place put Lewis, with Morrison assecretary and manager of sales. Guided by Sam these two, like the littledrygoods merchant of the old Rainey Company, went from capital to capitaland from city to city making contracts, influencing news, placingadvertising contracts where they would do the most good, fixing men.</p><p> And in the meantime Sam, with Webster, a banker named Crofts who hadprofited largely in the firearms merger, and sometimes Morrison or Prince,began a series of stock raids, speculations, and manipulations thatattracted country-wide attention, and became known to the newspaperreading world as the McPherson Chicago crowd. They were in oil, railroads,coal, western land, mining, timber, and street railways. One summer Sam,with Prince, built, ran to a profit, and sold to advantage a hugeamusement park. Through his head day after day marched columns of figures,ideas, schemes, more and more spectacular opportunities for gain. Some ofthe enterprises in which he engaged, while because of their size theyseemed more dignified, were of reality of a type with the game smugglingof his South Water Street days, and in all of his operations it was hisold instinct for bargains and for the finding of buyers together withWebster's ability for carrying through questionable deals that made himand his followers almost constantly successful in the face of oppositionfrom the more conservative business and financial men of the city.</p><p> Again Sam led a new life, owning running horses at the tracks, membershipsin many clubs, a country house in Wisconsin, and shooting preserves inTexas. He drank steadily, played poker for big stakes, kept in the publicprints, and day after day led his crew upon the high seas of finance. Hedid not dare think and in his heart he was sick of it. Sick to the soul,so that when thought came to him he got out of his bed to seek roisteringcompanions or, getting pen and paper, sat for hours figuring out new andmore daring schemes for money making. The great forward movement in modernindustry of which he had dreamed of being a part had for him turned out tobe a huge meaningless gamble with loaded dice against a credulous public.With his followers he went on day after day doing deeds without thought.Industries were organised and launched, men employed and thrown out ofemployment, towns wrecked by the destruction of an industry and othertowns made by the building of other industries. At a whim of his athousand men began building a city on an Indiana sand hill, and at a waveof his hand another thousand men of an Indiana town sold their homes, withthe chicken houses in the back-yards and vines trained by the kitchendoors, and rushed to buy sections of the hill plotted off for them. He didnot stop to discuss with his followers the meaning of the things he did.He told them of the profits to be made and then, having done the thing, hewent with them to drink in bar rooms and to spend the evening or afternoonsinging songs, visiting his stable of runners or, more often, sittingsilently about the card table playing for high stakes. Making millionsthrough the manipulation of the public during the day, he sometimes sathalf the night struggling with his companions for the possession ofthousands.</p><p> Lewis, the Jew, the only one of Sam's companions who had not followed himin his spectacular money making, stayed in the office of the firearmscompany and ran it like the scientific able man of business he was. WhileSam remained chairman of the board of the company and had an office, adesk, and the name of leadership there, he let Lewis run the place, andspent his own time upon the stock exchange or in some corner with Websterand Crofts planning some new money making raid.</p><p> "You have the better of it, Lewis," he said one day in a reflective mood;"you thought I had cut the ground from under you when I got Tom Edwards,but I only set you more firmly in a larger place."</p><p> He made a movement with his hand toward the large general offices with therows of busy clerks and the substantial look of work being done.</p><p> "I might have had the work you are doing. I planned and schemed with thatend in view," he added, lighting a cigar and going out at the door.</p><p> "And the money hunger got you," laughed Lewis, looking after him, "thehunger that gets Jews and Gentiles and all who feed it."</p><p> One might have come upon the McPherson Chicago crowd about the old Chicagostock exchange on any day during those years, Crofts, tall, abrupt, anddogmatic; Morrison, slender, dandified, and gracious; Webster, welldressed, suave, gentlemanly, and Sam, silent, restless, and often moroseand ugly. Sometimes it seemed to Sam that they were all unreal, himselfand the men with him. He watched his companions cunningly. They wereconstantly posing before the passing crowd of brokers and smallspeculators. Webster, coming up to him on the floor of the exchange, wouldtell him of a snowstorm raging outside with the air of a man parting witha long-cherished secret. His companions went from one to the other vowingeternal friendships, and then, keeping spies upon each other, they hurriedto Sam with tales of secret betrayals. Into any deal proposed by him theywent eagerly, although sometimes fearfully, and almost always they won.And with Sam they made millions through the manipulation of the firearmscompany, and the Chicago and Northern Lake Railroad which he controlled.</p><p> In later years Sam looked back upon it all as a kind of nightmare. Itseemed to him that never during that period had he lived or thoughtsanely. The great financial leaders that he saw were not, he thought,great men. Some of them, like Webster, were masters of craft, or, likeMorrison, of words, but for the most part they were but shrewd, greedyvultures feeding upon the public or upon each other.</p><p> In the meantime Sam was rapidly degenerating. His paunch became distended,and his hands trembled in the morning. Being a man of strong appetites,and having a determination to avoid women, he almost constantly overdrankand overate, and in the leisure hours that came to him he hurried eagerlyfrom place to place, avoiding thought, avoiding sane quiet talk, avoidinghimself.</p><p> All of his companions did not suffer equally. Webster seemed made for thelife, thriving and expanding under it, putting his winnings steadilyaside, going on Sunday to a suburban church, avoiding the publicityconnecting his name with race horses and big sporting events that Croftssought and to which Sam submitted. One day Sam and Crofts caught him in aneffort to sell them out to a group of New York bankers in a mining dealand turned the trick on him instead, whereupon he went off to New York tobecome a respectable big business man and the friend of senators andphilanthropists.</p><p> Crofts was a man with chronic domestic troubles, one of those men whobegin each day by cursing their wives before their associates and yetcontinue living with them year after year. There was a kind of roughsquareness in the man, and after the completion of a successful deal hewould be as happy as a boy, pounding men on the back, shaking withlaughter, throwing money about, making crude jokes. After Sam left Chicagohe finally divorced his wife and married an actress from the vaudevillestage and after losing two-thirds of his fortune in an effort to capturecontrol of a southern railroad, went to England and, coached by theactress wife, developed into an English country gentleman.</p><p> And Sam was a man sick. Day after day he went on drinking more and moreheavily, playing for bigger and bigger stakes, allowing himself less andless thought of himself. One day he received a long letter from JohnTelfer telling of the sudden death of Mary Underwood and berating him forhis neglect of her.</p><p> "She was ill for a year and without an income," wrote Telfer. Sam noticedthat the man's hand had begun to tremble. "She lied to me and told me youhad sent her money, but now that she is dead I find that though she wroteyou she got no answer. Her old aunt told me."</p><p> Sam put the letter into his pocket and going into one of his clubs begandrinking with a crowd of men he found idling there. He had paid littleattention to his correspondence for months. No doubt the letter from Maryhad been received by his secretary and thrown aside with the letters ofthousands of other women, begging letters, amorous letters, lettersdirected at him because of his wealth and the prominence given hisexploits by the newspapers.</p><p> After wiring an explanation and mailing a check the size of which filledJohn Telfer with admiration, Sam with a half dozen fellow roisterers spentthe late afternoon and evening going from saloon to saloon through thesouth side. When he got to his apartments late that night, his head wasreeling and his mind filled with distorted memories of drinking men andwomen and of himself standing on a table in some obscure drinking placeand calling upon the shouting, laughing hangers-on of his crowd of richmoney spenders to think and to work and to seek Truth.</p><p> He went to sleep in his chair, his mind filled with the dancing faces ofdead women, Mary Underwood and Janet and Sue, tear-stained faces callingto him. When he awoke and shaved he went out into the street and toanother down-town club.</p><p> "I wonder if Sue is dead, too," he muttered, remembering his dream.</p><p> At the club he was called to the telephone by Lewis, who asked him to comeat once to his office at the Edwards Consolidated. When he got there hefound a wire from Sue. In a moment of loneliness and despondency over theloss of his old business standing and reputation, Colonel Tom had shothimself in a New York hotel.</p><p> Sam sat at his desk, fingering the yellow paper lying before him andfighting to get his head clear.</p><p> "The old coward. The damned old coward," he muttered; "any one could havedone that."</p><p> When Lewis came into Sam's office he found his chief sitting at his deskfingering the telegram and muttering to himself. When Sam handed him thewire he came around and stood beside Sam, his hand upon his shoulder.</p><p> "Well, do not blame yourself for that," he said, with quick understanding.</p><p> "I don't," Sam muttered; "I do not blame myself for anything. I am aresult, not a cause. I am trying to think. I am not through yet. I amgoing to begin again when I get things thought out."</p><p> Lewis went out of the room leaving him to his thoughts. For an hour he satthere reviewing his life. When he came to the day that he had humiliatedColonel Tom, there came back to his mind the sentence he had written onthe sheet of paper while the vote was being counted. "The best men spendtheir lives seeking truth."</p><p> Suddenly he came to a decision and, calling Lewis, began laying out a planof action. His head cleared and the ring came back into his voice. ToLewis he gave an option on his entire holdings of Edwards Consolidatedstocks and bonds and to him also he entrusted the clearing up of dealafter deal in which he was interested. Then, calling a broker, he beganthrowing a mass of stock on the market. When Lewis told him that Croftswas 'phoning wildly about town to find him, and was with the help ofanother banker supporting the market and taking Sam's stocks as fast asoffered, he laughed and giving Lewis instructions regarding the disposalof his monies walked out of the office, again a free man and again seekingthe answer to his problem.</p><p> He made no attempt to answer Sue's wire. He was restless to get atsomething he had in his mind. He went to his apartments and packed a bagand from there disappeared saying goodbye to no one. In his mind was nodefinite idea of where he was going or what he was going to do. He knewonly that he would follow the message his hand had written. He would tryto spend his life seeking truth.</p><h2>Book III - Chapter 1</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> One day when the youth Sam McPherson was new in the city he went on aSunday afternoon to a down-town theatre to hear a sermon. The sermon wasdelivered by a small dark-skinned Boston man, and seemed to the youngMcPherson scholarly and well thought out.</p><p> "The greatest man is he whose deeds affect the greatest number of lives,"the speaker had said, and the thought had stuck in Sam's mind. Now walkingalong the street carrying his travelling bag, he remembered the sermon andthe thought and shook his head in doubt.</p><p> "What I have done here in this city must have affected thousands oflives," he mused, and felt a quickening of his blood at just letting go ofhis thoughts as he had not dared do since that day when, by breaking hisword to Sue, he had started on his career as a business giant.</p><p> He began to think of the quest on which he had started and had keensatisfaction in the thought of what he should do.</p><p> "I will begin all over and come up to Truth through work," he toldhimself. "I will leave the money hunger behind me, and if it returns Iwill come back here to Chicago and see my fortune piled up and the menrushing about the banks and the stock exchange and the court they pay tosuch fools and brutes as I have been, and that will cure me."</p><p> Into the Illinois Central Station he went, a strange spectacle. A smilecame to his lips as he sat on a bench along the wall between an immigrantfrom Russia and a small plump farmer's wife who held a banana in her handand gave bites of it to a rosy-cheeked babe lying in her arms. He, anAmerican multimillionaire, a man in the midst of his money-making, one whohad realised the American dream, to have sickened at the feast and to havewandered out of a fashionable club with a bag in his hand and a roll ofbills in his pocket and to have come on this strange quest--to seek Truth,to seek God. A few years of the fast greedy living in the city, that hadseemed so splendid to the Iowa boy and to the men and women who had livedin his town, and then a woman had died lonely and in want in that Iowatown, and half across the continent a fat blustering old man had shothimself in a New York hotel, and here he sat.</p><p> Leaving his bag in the care of the farmer's wife, he walked across theroom to the ticket window and standing there watched the people withdefinite destinations in mind come up, lay down money, and taking theirtickets go briskly away. He had no fear of being known. Although his nameand his picture had been upon the front pages of Chicago newspapers foryears, he felt so great a change within himself from just the resolutionhe had taken that he had no doubt of passing unnoticed.</p><p> A thought struck him. Looking up and down the long room filled with itsstrangely assorted clusters of men and women a sense of the great toilingmasses of people, the labourers, the small merchants, the skilledmechanics, came over him.</p><p> "These are the Americans," he began telling himself, "these people withchildren beside them and with hard daily work to be done, and many of themwith stunted or imperfectly developed bodies, not Crofts, not Morrison andI, but these others who toil without hope of luxury and wealth, who makeup the armies in times of war and raise up boys and girls to do the workof the world in their turn."</p><p> He fell into the line moving toward the ticket window behind a sturdylooking old man who carried a box of carpenter tools in one hand and a bagin the other, and bought a ticket to the same Illinois town to which theold man was bound.</p><p> In the train he sat beside the old man and the two fell into quiet talk-the old man talking of his family. He had a son, married and living in theIllinois town to which he was going, of whom he began boasting. The son,he said, had gone to that town and had prospered there, owning a hotelwhich his wife managed while he worked as a builder.</p><p> "Ed," he said, "keeps fifty or sixty men going all summer. He has sent forme to come and take charge of a gang. He knows well enough I will get thework out of them."</p><p> From Ed the old man drifted into talk of himself and his life, tellingbare facts with directness and simplicity and making no effort to disguisea slight turn of vanity in his success.</p><p> "I have raised seven sons and made them all good workmen and they are alldoing well," he said.</p><p> He told of each in detail. One, who had taken to books, was a mechanicalengineer in a manufacturing town in New England. The mother of hischildren had died the year before and of his three daughters two hadmarried mechanics. The third, Sam gathered, had not done well and fromsomething the old man said he thought she had perhaps gone the wrong waythere in Chicago.</p><p> To the old man Sam talked of God and of a man's effort to get truth out oflife.</p><p> "I have thought of it a lot," he said.</p><p> The old man was interested. He looked at Sam and then out at the carwindow and began talking of his own beliefs, the substance of which Samcould not get.</p><p> "God is a spirit and lives in the growing corn," said the old man,pointing out the window at the passing fields.</p><p> He began talking of churches and of ministers, against whom he was filledwith bitterness.</p><p> "They are dodgers. They do not get at things. They are damned dodgers,pretending to be good," he declared.</p><p> Sam talked of himself, saying that he was alone in the world and hadmoney. He said that he wanted work in the open air, not for the money itwould bring him, but because his paunch was large and his hand trembled inthe morning.</p><p> "I've been drinking," he said, "and I want to work hard day after day sothat my muscles may become firm and sleep come to me at night."</p><p> The old man thought that his son could find Sam a place.</p><p> "He's a driver--Ed is," he said, laughing, "and he won't pay you much. Eddon't let go of money. He's a tight one."</p><p> Night had come when they reached the town where Ed lived, and the threemen walked over a bridge, beneath which roared a waterfall, toward thelong poorly-lighted main street of the town and Ed's hotel. Ed, a young,broad-shouldered man, with a dry cigar stuck in the corner of his mouth,led the way. He had engaged Sam standing in the darkness on the stationplatform, accepting his story without comment.</p><p> "I'll let you carry timbers and drive nails," he said, "that will hardenyou up."</p><p> On the way over the bridge he talked of the town.</p><p> "It's a live place," he said, "we are getting people in here."</p><p> "Look at that!" he exclaimed, chewing at the cigar and pointing to thewaterfall that foamed and roared almost under the bridge. "There's a lotof power there and where there's power there will be a city."</p><p> At Ed's hotel some twenty men sat about a long low office. They were, forthe most part, middle-aged working men and sat in silence reading andsmoking pipes. At a table pushed against the wall a bald-headed young manwith a scar on his cheek played solitaire with a greasy pack of cards, andin front of him and sitting in a chair tilted against the wall a sullenfaced boy idly watched the game. When the three men came into the officethe boy dropped his chair to the floor and stared at Ed who stared back athim. It was as though a contest of some sort went on between them. A tallneatly-dressed woman, with a brisk manner and pale, inexpressive, hardblue eyes, stood back of a little combined desk and cigar case at the endof the room, and as the three walked toward her she looked from Ed to thesullen-faced boy and then again at Ed. Sam concluded she was a woman benton having her own way. She had that air.</p><p> "This is my wife," said Ed, introducing Sam with a wave of his hand andpassing around the end of the desk to stand by her side.</p><p> Ed's wife twirled the hotel register about facing Sam, nodded her head,and then, leaning over the desk, bestowed a quick kiss upon the leatherycheek of the old carpenter.</p><p> Sam and the old man found a place in chairs along the wall and sat downamong the silent men. The old man pointed to the boy in the chair besidethe card players.</p><p> "Their son," he whispered cautiously.</p><p> The boy looked at his mother, who in turn looked steadily at him, and gotup from his chair. Back of the desk Ed talked in low tones to his wife.The boy, stopping before Sam and the old man and still looking toward thewoman, put out his hand which the old man took. Then, without speaking,he went past the desk and through a doorway, and began noisily climbinga flight of stairs, followed by his mother. As they climbed they beratedeach other, their voices rising to a high pitch and echoing through theupper part of the house.</p><p> Ed, coming across to them, talked to Sam about the assignment of a room,and the men began looking at the stranger; noting his fine clothes, theireyes filled with curiosity.</p><p> "Selling something?" asked a large red-haired young man, rolling a quid oftobacco in his mouth.</p><p> "No," replied Sam shortly, "going to work for Ed."</p><p> The silent men in chairs along the wall dropped their newspapers andstared, and the bald-headed young man at the table sat with open mouth, acard held suspended in the air. Sam had become, for the moment, a centreof interest and the men stirred in their chairs and began to whisper andpoint to him.</p><p> A large, watery-eyed man, with florid cheeks, clad in a long overcoat withspots down the front, came in at the door and passed through the roombowing and smiling to the men. Taking Ed by the arm he disappeared into alittle barroom, where Sam could hear him talking in low tones.</p><p> After a little while the florid-faced man came and put his head throughthe barroom door into the office.</p><p> "Come on, boys," he said, smiling and nodding right and left, "the drinksare on me."</p><p> The men got up and filed into the bar, the old man and Sam remainingseated in their chairs. They began talking in undertones.</p><p> "I'll start 'em thinking--these men," said the old man.</p><p> From his pocket he took a pamphlet and gave it to Sam. It was a crudelywritten attack upon rich men and corporations.</p><p> "Some brains in the fellow who wrote that," said the old carpenter,rubbing his hands together and smiling.</p><p> Sam did not think so. He sat reading it and listening to the loud,boisterous voices of the men in the barroom. The florid-faced man wasexplaining the details of a proposed town bond issue. Sam gathered thatthe water power in the river was to be developed.</p><p> "We want to make this a live town," said the voice of Ed, earnestly.</p><p> The old man, leaning over and putting his hand beside his mouth, beganwhispering to Sam.</p><p> "I'll bet there is a capitalist deal back of that power scheme," he said.</p><p> He nodded his head up and down and smiled knowingly.</p><p> "If there is Ed will be in on it," he added. "You can't lose Ed. He's aslick one."</p><p> He took the pamphlet from Sam's hand and put it in his pocket.</p><p> "I'm a socialist," he explained, "but don't say anything. Ed's against'em."</p><p> The men filed back into the room, each with a freshly-lighted cigar in hismouth, and the florid-faced man followed them and went out at the officedoor.</p><p> "Well, so long, boys," he shouted heartily.</p><p> Ed went silently up the stairs to join the mother and boy, whose voicescould still be heard raised in outbursts of wrath from above as the mentook their former chairs along the wall.</p><p> "Well, Bill's sure all right," said the red-haired young man, evidentlyexpressing the opinion of the men in regard to the florid-faced man.</p><p> A small bent old man with sunken cheeks got up and walking across the roomleaned against the cigar case.</p><p> "Did you ever hear this one?" he asked, looking about.</p><p> Obviously no answer could be given and the bent old man launched into avile pointless anecdote of a woman, a miner, and a mule, the crowd givingclose attention and laughing uproariously when he had finished. Thesocialist rubbed his hands together and joined in the applause.</p><p> "That was a good one, eh?" he commented, turning to Sam.</p><p> Sam, picking up his bag, climbed the stairway as the red-haired young manlaunched into another tale, slightly less vile. In his room to which Ed,meeting him at the top of the stairs, led him, still chewing at theunlighted cigar, he turned out the light and sat on the edge of the bed.He was as homesick as a boy.</p><p> "Truth," he muttered, looking through the window to the dimly-lightedstreet. "Do these men seek truth?"</p><p> The next day he went to work, wearing a suit of clothes bought from Ed. Heworked with Ed's father, carrying timbers and driving nails as directed byhim. In the gang with him were four men, boarders at Ed's hotel, and fourother men who lived in the town with their families. At the noon hour heasked the old carpenter how the men from the hotel, who did not live inthe town, could vote on the question of the power bonds. The old mangrinned and rubbed his hands together.</p><p> "I don't know," he said. "I suppose Ed tends to that. He's a slick one, Edis."</p><p> At work, the men who had been so silent in the office of the hotel werealert and wonderfully busy, hurrying here and there at a word from the oldman and sawing and nailing furiously. They seemed bent upon outdoing eachother and when one fell behind they laughed and shouted at him, asking himif he had decided to quit for the day. But though they seemed determinedto outdo him the old man kept ahead of them all, his hammer beating arattling tattoo upon the boards all day. At the noon hour he had giveneach of the men one of the pamphlets from his pocket and on the way backto his hotel in the evening he told Sam that the others had tried to showhim up.</p><p> "They wanted to see if I had juice in me," he explained, strutting besideSam with an amusing little swagger of his shoulders.</p><p> Sam was sick with fatigue. His hands were blistered, his legs felt weak,and a terrible thirst burned in his throat. All day he had gone grimlyahead, thankful for every physical discomfort, every throb of hisstrained, tired muscles. In his weariness and in his efforts to keep pacewith the others he had forgotten Colonel Tom and Mary Underwood.</p><p> All during that month and into the next Sam stayed with the old man'sgang. He ceased thinking, and only worked desperately. An odd feeling ofloyalty and devotion to the old man came over him and he felt that he toomust prove that he had the juice in him. At the hotel he went to bedimmediately after the silent dinner, slept, awoke aching, and went to workagain.</p><p> One Sunday one of the men of his gang came to Sam's room and invited himto go with a party of the workers into the country. They went in boats,carrying with them kegs of beer, to a deep ravine clothed on both sides byheavy woods. In the boat with Sam sat the red-haired young man, who wascalled Jake and who talked loudly of the time they would have in thewoods, and boasted that he was the instigator of the trip.</p><p> "I thought of it," he said over and over again.</p><p> Sam wondered why he had been invited. It was a soft October day and in theravine he sat looking at the trees splashed with colour and breathingdeeply of the air, his whole body relaxed, grateful for the day of rest.Jake came and sat beside him.</p><p> "What are you?" he asked bluntly. "We know you are no working man."</p><p> Sam told him a half-truth.</p><p> "You are right enough about that; I have money enough not to have to work.I used to be a business man. I sold guns. But I have a disease and thedoctors have told me that if I do not work out of doors part of me willdie."</p><p> The man from his own gang who had invited him on the trip came up to them,bringing Sam a foaming glass of beer. He shook his head.</p><p> "The doctor says it will not do," he explained to the two men.</p><p> The red-haired man called Jake began talking.</p><p> "We are going to have a fight with Ed," he said. "That's what we came uphere to talk about. We want to know where you stand. We are going to seeif we can't make him pay as well for the work here as men are paid for thesame work in Chicago."</p><p> Sam lay back upon the grass.</p><p> "All right," he said. "Go ahead. If I can help I will. I'm not so fond ofEd."</p><p> The men began talking among themselves. Jake, standing among them, readaloud a list of names among which was the name Sam had written on theregister at Ed's hotel.</p><p> "It's a list of the names of men we think will stick together and votetogether on the bond issue," he explained, turning to Sam. "Ed's in thatand we want to use our votes to scare him into giving us what we want.Will you stay with us? You look like a fighter."</p><p> Sam nodded and getting up joined the men about the beer kegs. They begantalking of Ed and of the money he had made in the town.</p><p> "He's done a lot of town work here and there's been graft in all of it,"explained Jake emphatically. "It's time he was being made to do the rightthing."</p><p> While they talked Sam sat watching the men's faces. They did not seem vileto him now as they had seemed that first evening in the hotel office. Hebegan thinking of them silently and alertly at work all day long,surrounded by such influences as Ed and Bill, and the thought sweetenedhis opinion of them.</p><p> "Look here," he said, "tell me of this matter. I was a business man beforeI came here and I may be able to help you fellows get what you want."</p><p> Getting up, Jake took Sam's arm and they walked down the ravine, Jakeexplaining the situation in the town.</p><p> "The game," he said, "is to make the taxpayers pay for a millrace to bebuilt for the development of the water power in the river and then, by atrick, to turn it over to a private company. Bill and Ed are both in thedeal and they are working for a Chicago man named Crofts. He's been uphere at the hotel with Bill talking to Ed. I've figured out what they areup to." Sam sat down upon a log and laughed heartily.</p><p> "Crofts, eh?" he exclaimed. "Say, we will fight this thing. If Crofts hasbeen up here you can depend upon it there is some size to the deal. Wewill just smash the whole crooked gang for the good of the town."</p><p> "How would you do that?" asked Jake.</p><p> Sam sat down on a log and looked at the river flowing past the mouth ofthe ravine.</p><p> "Just fight," he said. "Let me show you something."</p><p> He took a pencil and slip of paper from his pocket, and, with the voicesof the men about the beer kegs in his ears and the red-haired man peeringover his shoulder, began writing his first political pamphlet. He wroteand erased and changed words and phrases. The pamphlet was a statement offacts as to the value of water power, and was addressed to the taxpayersof the community. He warmed to the subject, saying that a fortune laysleeping in the river, and that the town, by the exercise of a littlediscretion now, could build with that fortune a beautiful city belongingto the people.</p><p> "This fortune in the river rightly managed will pay the expenses ofgovernment and give you control of a great source of revenue forever," hewrote. "Build your millrace, but look out for a trick of the politicians.They are trying to steal it. Reject the offer of the Chicago banker namedCrofts. Demand an investigation. A capitalist has been found who will takethe water power bonds at four per cent and back the people in this fightfor a free American city." Across the head of the pamphlet Sam wrote thecaption, "A River Paved With Gold," and handed it to Jake, who read it andwhistled softly.</p><p> "Good!" he said. "I will take this and have it printed. It will make Billand Ed sit up."</p><p> Sam took a twenty-dollar bill from his pocket and gave it to the man.</p><p> "To pay for the printing," he said. "And when we have them licked I am theman who will take the four per cent bonds."</p><p> Jake scratched his head. "How much do you suppose the deal is worth toCrofts?"</p><p> "A million, or he would not bother," Sam answered.</p><p> Jake folded the paper and put it in his pocket.</p><p> "This would make Bill and Ed squirm, eh?" he laughed.</p><p> Going home down the river the men, filled with beer, sang and shouted asthe boats, guided by Sam and Jake, floated along. The night fell warm andstill and Sam thought he had never seen the sky so filled with stars. Hisbrain was busy with the idea of doing something for the people.</p><p> "Perhaps here in this town I shall make a start toward what I am after,"he thought, his heart filled with happiness and the songs of the tipsyworkmen ringing in his ears.</p><p> All through the next few weeks there was an air of something astir amongthe men of Sam's gang and about Ed's hotel. During the evening Jake wentamong the men talking in low tones, and once he took a three days'vacation, telling Ed that he did not feel well and spending the time amongthe men employed in the plough works up the river. From time to time hecame to Sam for money.</p><p> "For the campaign," he said, winking and hurrying away.</p><p> Suddenly a speaker appeared and began talking nightly from a box before adrug store on Main Street, and after dinner the office of Ed's hotel wasdeserted. The man on the box had a blackboard hung on a pole, on which hedrew figures estimating the value of the power in the river, and as hetalked he grew more and more excited, waving his arms and inveighingagainst certain leasing clauses in the bond proposal. He declared himselfa follower of Karl Marx and delighted the old carpenter who danced up anddown in the road and rubbed his hands.</p><p> "It will come to something--this will--you'll see," he declared to Sam.</p><p> One day Ed appeared, riding in a buggy, at the job where Sam worked, andcalled the old man into the road. He sat pounding one hand upon the otherand talking in a low voice. Sam thought the old man had perhaps beenindiscreet in the distribution of the socialistic pamphlets. He seemednervous, dancing up and down beside the buggy and shaking his head. Thenhurrying back to where the men worked he pointed over his shoulder withhis thumb.</p><p> "Ed wants you," he said, and Sam noticed that his voice trembled and hishand shook.</p><p> In the buggy Ed and Sam rode in silence. Again Ed chewed at an unlightedcigar.</p><p> "I want to talk with you," he had said as Sam climbed into the buggy.</p><p> At the hotel the two men got out of the buggy and went into the office.Inside the door Ed, who came behind, sprang forward and pinioned Sam'sarms with his own. He was as powerful as a bear. His wife, the tall womanwith the inexpressive eyes, came running into the room, her face drawnwith hatred. In her hand she carried a broom and with the handle of thisshe struck Sam several swinging blows across the face, accompanying eachblow with a half scream of rage and a volley of vile names. The sullenfaced boy, alive now and with eyes burning with zeal, came running downthe stairs and pushed the woman aside. He struck Sam time after time inthe face with his fist, laughing each time as Sam winced under the blows.</p><p> Sam struggled furiously to escape Ed's powerful grasp. It was the firsttime he had ever been beaten and the first time he had faced hopelessdefeat. The wrath within him was so intense that the jolting impact of theblows seemed a secondary matter to the need of escaping Ed's vice-likegrasp.</p><p> Suddenly Ed turned and, pushing Sam before him, threw him through theoffice door and into the street. In falling his head struck against ahitching post and he lay stunned. When he partially recovered from thefall Sam got up and walked along the street. His face was swollen andbruised and his nose bled. The street was deserted and the assault uponhim had been unnoticed.</p><p> He went to a hotel on Main Street--a more pretentious place than Ed's,near the bridge leading to the station--and as he passed in he saw,through an open door, Jake, the red-haired man, leaning against the barand talking to Bill, the man with the florid face. Sam, paying for a room,went upstairs and to bed.</p><p> In the bed, with cold bandages on his bruised face, he tried to get thesituation in hand. Hatred for Ed ran through his veins. His handsclenched, his brain whirled, and the brutal, passionate faces of the womanand the boy danced before his eyes.</p><p> "I'll fix them, the brutal bullies," he muttered aloud.</p><p> And then the thought of his quest came back to his mind and quieted him.Through the window came the roar of the waterfall, broken by noises of thestreet. As he fell asleep they mingled with his dreams, sounding soft andquiet like the low talk of a family about the fire of an evening.</p><p> He was awakened by a noise of pounding on his door. At his call the dooropened and the face of the old carpenter appeared. Sam laughed and sat upin bed. Already the cold bandages had soothed the throbbing of his bruisedface.</p><p> "Go away," begged the old man, rubbing his hands together nervously. "Getout of town."</p><p> He put his hand to his mouth and talked in a hoarse whisper, looking backover his shoulder through the open door. Sam, getting out of bed, beganfilling his pipe.</p><p> "You can't beat Ed, you fellows," added the old man, backing out at thedoor. "He's a slick one, Ed is. You better get out of town."</p><p> Sam called a boy and gave him a note to Ed asking for his clothes and forthe bag in his room, and to the boy he gave a large bill, asking him topay anything due. When the boy came back bringing the clothes and the baghe returned the bill unbroken.</p><p> "They're scared about something up there," he said, looking at Sam'sbruised face.</p><p> Sam dressed carefully and went down into the street. He remembered that hehad never seen a printed copy of the political pamphlet written in theravine and realised that Jake had used it to make money for himself.</p><p> "Now I shall try something else," he thought.</p><p> It was early evening and crowds of men coming down the railroad track fromthe plough works turned to right and left as they reached Main Street. Samwalked among them, climbing a little hilly side street to a number he hadgot from a clerk at the drug store before which the socialist had talked.He stopped at a little frame house and a moment after knocking was in thepresence of the man who had talked night after night from the box in thestreet. Sam had decided to see what could be done through him. Thesocialist was a short, fat man, with curly grey hair, shiny round cheeks,and black broken teeth. He sat on the edge of his bed and looked as if hehad slept in his clothes. A corncob pipe lay smoking among the covers ofthe bed, and during most of the talk he sat with one shoe held in his handas though about to put it on. About the room in orderly piles lay stackafter stack of paper-covered books. Sam sat down in a chair by the windowand told his mission.</p><p> "It is a big thing, this power steal that is going on here," he explained."I know the man back of it and he would not bother with a small affair. Iknow they are going to make the city build the millrace and then steal it.It will be a big thing for your party about here if you take hold and stopthem. Let me tell you how it can be done."</p><p> He explained his plan, and told of Crofts and of his wealth and dogged,bullying determination. The socialist seemed beside himself. He pulled onthe shoe and began running hurriedly about the room.</p><p> "The time for the election," Sam went on, "is almost here. I have lookedinto this thing. We must beat this bond issue and then put through asquare one. There is a train out of Chicago at seven o'clock, a fasttrain. You get fifty speakers out here. I will pay for a special train ifnecessary and I will hire a band and help stir things up. I can give youfacts enough to shake this town to the bottom. You come with me and 'phoneto Chicago. I will pay everything. I am McPherson, Sam McPherson ofChicago."</p><p> The socialist ran to a closet and began pulling on his coat. The nameaffected him so that his hand trembled and he could scarcely get his arminto the coat sleeve. He began to apologise for the appearance of the roomand kept looking at Sam with the air of one not able to believe what hehad heard. As the two men walked out of the house he ran ahead holdingdoors open for Sam's passage.</p><p> "And you will help us, Mr. McPherson?" he exclaimed. "You, a man ofmillions, will help us in this fight?"</p><p> Sam had a feeling that the man was going to kiss his hand or do somethingequally ridiculous. He had the air of a club door man gone off his head.</p><p> At the hotel Sam stood in the lobby while the fat man waited in atelephone booth.</p><p> "I will have to 'phone Chicago, I will simply have to 'phone Chicago. Wesocialists don't do anything like this offhand, Mr. McPherson," he hadexplained as they walked along the street.</p><p> When the socialist came out of the booth he stood before Sam shaking hishead. His whole attitude had changed, and he looked like a man caughtdoing a foolish or absurd thing.</p><p> "Nothing doing, nothing doing, Mr. McPherson," he said, starting for thehotel door.</p><p> At the door he stopped and shook his finger at Sam.</p><p> "It won't work," he said, emphatically. "Chicago is too wise."</p><p> Sam turned and went back to his room. His name had killed his only chanceto beat Crofts, Jake, Bill and Ed. In his room he sat looking out of thewindow into the street.</p><p> "Where shall I take hold now?" he asked himself.</p><p> Turning out the lights he sat listening to the roar of the waterfall andthinking of the events of the last week.</p><p> "I have had a time," he thought. "I have tried something and even thoughit did not work it has been the best fun I have had for years."</p><p> The hours slipped away and night came on. He could hear men shouting andlaughing in the street, and going downstairs he stood in a hallway at theedge of the crowd that gathered about the socialist. The orator shoutedand waved his hand. He seemed as proud as a young recruit who has justpassed through his first baptism of fire.</p><p> "He tried to make a fool of me--McPherson of Chicago--the millionaire--oneof the capitalist kings--he tried to bribe me and my party."</p><p> In the crowd the old carpenter was dancing in the road and rubbing hishands together. With the feeling of a man who had finished a piece of workor turned the last leaf of a book, Sam went back to his hotel.</p><p> "In the morning I shall be on my way," he thought.</p><p> A knock came at the door and the red-haired man came in. He closed thedoor softly and winked at Sam.</p><p> "Ed made a mistake," he said, and laughed. "The old man told him you werea socialist and he thought you were trying to spoil the graft. He isscared about that beating you got and mighty sorry. He's all right--Ed is--and he and Bill and I have got the votes. What made you stay under coverso long? Why didn't you tell us you were McPherson?"</p><p> Sam saw the hopelessness of any attempt to explain. Jake had evidentlysold out the men. Sam wondered how.</p><p> "How do you know you can deliver the votes?'" he asked, trying to leadJake on.</p><p> Jake rolled the quid in his mouth and winked again.</p><p> "It was easy enough to fix the men when Ed, Bill and I got together," hesaid. "You know about the other. There's a clause in the act authorisingthe bond issue, a sleeper, Bill calls it. You know more about that than Ido. Anyway the power will be turned over to the man we say."</p><p> "But how do I know you can deliver the votes?"</p><p> Jake threw out his hand impatiently.</p><p> "What do they know?" he asked sharply. "What they want is more wages.There's a million in the power deal and they can't any more realise amillion than they can tell what they want to do in Heaven. I promised Ed'sfellows the city scale. Ed can't kick. He'll make a hundred thousand as itstands. Then I promised the plough works gang a ten per cent raise. We'llget it for them if we can, but if we can't, they won't know it till thedeal is put through."</p><p> Sam walked over and held open the door.</p><p> "Good night," he said.</p><p> Jake looked annoyed.</p><p> "Ain't you even going to make a bid against Crofts?" he asked. "We ain'ttied to him if you do better by us. I'm in this thing because you put mein. That piece you wrote up the river scared 'em stiff. I want to do theright thing by you. Don't be sore about Ed. He wouldn't a done it if he'dknown."</p><p> Sam shook his head and stood with his hand still on the door.</p><p> "Good night," he said again. "I am not in it. I have dropped it. No usetrying to explain."</p><p> </p><h2>Book III - Chapter 2</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> For weeks and months Sam led a wandering vagabond life, and surely astranger or more restless vagabond never went upon the road. In his pockethe had at almost any time from one to five thousand dollars, his bag wenton from place to place ahead of him, and now and then he caught up withit, unpacked it, and wore a suit of his former Chicago clothes upon thestreets of some town. For the most part, however, he wore the roughclothes bought from Ed, and, when these were gone, others like them, witha warm canvas outer jacket, and for rough weather a pair of heavy bootslacing half way up the legs. Among the people, he passed for a ratherwell-set-up workman with money in his pocket going his own way.</p><p> During all those months of wandering, and even when he had returned tosomething nearer his former way of life, his mind was unsettled and hisoutlook on life disturbed. Sometimes it seemed to him that he, among allmen, was a unique, an innovation. Day after day his mind ground away uponhis problem and he was determined to seek and to keep on seeking until hefound for himself a way of peace. In the towns and in the country throughwhich he passed he saw the clerks in the stores, the merchants withworried faces hurrying into banks, the farmers, brutalised by toil,dragging their weary bodies homeward at the coming of night, and toldhimself that all life was abortive, that on all sides of him it woreitself out in little futile efforts or ran away in side currents, thatnowhere did it move steadily, continuously forward giving point to thetremendous sacrifice involved in just living and working in the world. Hethought of Christ going about seeing the world and talking to men, andthought that he too would go and talk to them, not as a teacher, but asone seeking eagerly to be taught. At times he was filled with longing andinexpressible hopes and, like the boy of Caxton, would get out of bed, notnow to stand in Miller's pasture watching the rain on the surface of thewater, but to walk endless miles through the darkness getting the blessedrelief of fatigue into his body and often paying for and occupying twobeds in one night.</p><p> Sam wanted to go back to Sue; he wanted peace and something likehappiness, but most of all he wanted work, real work, work that woulddemand of him day after day the best and finest in him so that he would beheld to the need of renewing constantly the better impulses of his mind.He was at the top of his life, and the few weeks of hard physical exertionas a driver of nails and a bearer of timbers had begun to restore his bodyto shapeliness and strength, so that he was filled anew with all of hisnative restlessness and energy; but he was determined that he would notagain pour himself out in work that would react upon him as had his moneymaking, his dream of beautiful children, and this last half-formed dreamof a kind of financial fatherhood to the Illinois town.</p><p> The incident with Ed and the red-haired man had been his first seriouseffort at anything like social service achieved through controlling orattempting to influence the public mind, for his was the type of mind thatruns to the concrete, the actual. As he sat in the ravine talking to Jake,and, later, coming home in the boat under the multitude of stars, he hadlooked up from among the drunken workmen and his mind had seen a citybuilt for a people, a city independent, beautiful, strong, and free, but aglimpse of a red head through a barroom door and a socialist tremblingbefore a name had dispelled the vision. After his return from hearing thesocialist, who in his turn was hedged about by complicated influences, andin those November days when he walked south through Illinois, seeing thelate glory of the trees and breathing the fine air, he laughed at himselffor having had the vision. It was not that the red-haired man had sold himout, it was not the beating given him by Ed's sullen-faced son or theblows across the face at the hands of his vigorous wife--it was just thatat bottom he did not believe the people wanted reform; they wanted a tenper cent raise in wages. The public mind was a thing too big, toocomplicated and inert for a vision or an ideal to get at and move deeply.</p><p> And then, walking on the road and struggling to find truth even withinhimself, Sam had to come to something else. At bottom he was no leader, noreformer. He had not wanted the free city for a free people, but as a workto be done by his own hand. He was McPherson, the money maker, the man wholoved himself. The fact, not the sight of Jake hobnobbing with Bill or thetimidity of the socialist, had blocked his way to work as a politicalreformer and builder.</p><p> Tramping south between the rows of shocked corn he laughed at himself."The experience with Ed and Jake has done something for me," he thought."They bullied me. I have been a kind of bully myself and what has happenedhas been good medicine for me."</p><p> Sam walked the roads of Illinois, Ohio, New York, and other states,through hill country and flat country, in the snow drifts of winter andthrough the storms of spring, talking to people, asking their way of lifeand the end toward which they worked. At night he dreamed of Sue, of hisboyhood struggles in Caxton, of Janet Eberly sitting in her chair andtalking of writers of books, or, visualising the stock exchange or somegarish drinking place, he saw again the faces of Crofts, Webster,Morrison, and Prince intent and eager as he laid before them some schemeof money making. Sometimes at night he awoke, seized with horror, seeingColonel Tom with the revolver pressed against his head; and sitting in hisbed, and all through the next day he talked aloud to himself.</p><p> "The damned old coward," he shouted into the darkness of his room or intothe wide peaceful prospect of the countryside.</p><p> The idea of Colonel Tom as a suicide seemed unreal, grotesque, horrible.It was as though some round-cheeked, curly-headed boy had done the thingto himself. The man had been so boyishly, so blusteringly incompetent, socompletely and absolutely without bigness and purpose.</p><p> "And yet," thought Sam, "he has found strength to whip me, the man ofability. He has taken revenge, absolute and unanswerable, for the slight Iput upon the little play world in which he had been king."</p><p> In fancy Sam could see the great paunch and the little white pointed beardsticking up from the floor in the room where the colonel lay dead, andinto his mind came a saying, a sentence, the distorted remembrance of athought he had got from a book of Janet's or from some talk he had heard,perhaps at his own dinner table.</p><p> "It is horrible to see a fat man with purple veins in his face lyingdead."</p><p> At such times he hurried along the road like one pursued. People drivingpast in buggies and seeing him and hearing the stream of talk that issuedfrom his lips, turned and watched him out of sight. And Sam, hurrying andseeking relief from the thoughts in his mind, called to the oldcommonsense instincts within himself as a captain marshals his forces towithstand an attack.</p><p> "I will find work. I will find work. I will seek Truth," he said.</p><p> Sam avoided the larger towns or went hurriedly through them, sleepingnight after night at village hotels or at some hospitable farmhouse, anddaily he increased the length of his walks, getting real satisfaction fromthe aching of his legs and from the bruising of his unaccustomed feet onthe hard road. Like St. Jerome, he had a wish to beat upon his body andsubdue the flesh. In turn he was blown upon by the wind, chilled by thewinter frost, wet by the rains, and warmed by the sun. In the spring heswam in rivers, lay on sheltered hillsides watching the cattle grazing inthe fields and the white clouds floating across the sky, and constantlyhis legs became harder and his body more flat and sinewy. Once he sleptfor a night in a straw stack at the edge of a woods and in the morning wasawakened by a farmer's dog licking his face.</p><p> Several times he came up to vagabonds, umbrella menders and otherroadsters, and walked with them, but he found in their society noincentive to join in their flights across country on freight trains or onthe fronts of passenger trains. Those whom he met and with whom he talkedand walked did not interest him greatly. They had no end in life, soughtno ideal of usefulness. Walking and talking with them, the romance wentout of their wandering life. They were utterly dull and stupid, they were,almost without exception, strikingly unclean, they wanted passionately toget drunk, and they seemed to be forever avoiding life with its problemsand responsibilities. They always talked of the big cities, of "Chi" and"Cinci" and "Frisco," and were bent upon getting to one of these places.They condemned the rich and begged and stole from the poor, talkedswaggeringly of their personal courage and ran whimpering and beggingbefore country constables. One of them, a tall, leering youth in a greycap, who came up to Sam one evening at the edge of a village in Indiana,tried to rob him. Full of his new strength and with the thought of Ed'swife and the sullen-faced son in his mind, Sam sprang upon him and hadrevenge for the beating received in the office of Ed's hotel by beatingthis fellow in his turn. When the tall youth had partially recovered fromthe beating and had staggered to his feet, he ran off into the darkness,stopping when well out of reach to hurl a stone that splashed in the mudof the road at Sam's feet.</p><p> Everywhere Sam sought people who would talk to him of themselves. He had akind of faith that a message would come to him out of the mouth of somesimple, homely dweller of the villages or the farms. A woman, with whom hetalked in the railroad station at Fort Wayne, Indiana, interested him sothat he went into a train with her and travelled all night in the daycoach, listening to her talk of her three sons, one of whom had weak lungsand had, with two younger brothers, taken up government land in the west.The woman had been with them for some months, helping them to get a start.</p><p> "I was raised on a farm and knew things they could not know," she toldSam, raising her voice above the rumble of the train and the snoring offellow passengers.</p><p> She had worked with her sons in the field, ploughing and planting, haddriven a team across country, carrying boards for the building of a house,and had grown brown and strong at the work.</p><p> "And Walter is getting well. His arms are as brown as my own and he hasgained eleven pounds," she said, rolling up her sleeves and showing herheavy, muscular forearms.</p><p> She planned to take her husband, a machinist working in a bicycle factoryin Buffalo, and her two grown daughters, clerks in a drygoods store, withher and return to the new country, and having a sense of her hearer'sinterest in her story, she talked of the bigness of the west and theloneliness of the vast, silent plains, saying that they sometimes made herheart ache. Sam thought she had in some way achieved success, although hedid not see how her experience could serve as a guide to him.</p><p> "You have got somewhere. You have got hold of a truth," he said, takingher hand when he got off the train at Cleveland, at dawn.</p><p> At another time, in the late spring, when he was tramping through southernOhio, a man drove up beside him, and pulling in his horse, asked, "Whereare you going?" adding genially, "I may be able to give you a lift."</p><p> Sam looked at him and smiled. Something in the man's manner or in hisdress suggesting the man of God, he assumed a bantering air.</p><p> "I am on my way to the New Jerusalem," he said seriously. "I am one whoseeks God."</p><p> The young minister picked up his reins with a look of alarm, but when hesaw a smile playing about the corners of Sam's mouth, he turned the wheelsof his buggy.</p><p> "Get in and come along with me and we will talk of the New Jerusalem," hesaid.</p><p> On the impulse Sam got into the buggy, and driving along the dusty road,told the essential parts of his story and of his quest for an end towardwhich he might work.</p><p> "It would be simple enough if I were without money and driven by hardnecessity, but I am not. I want work, not because it is work and willbring me bread and butter, but because I need to be doing something thatwill satisfy me when I am done. I do not want so much to serve men as toserve myself. I want to get at happiness and usefulness as for years I gotat money making. There is a right way of life for such a man as me, and Iwant to find that way."</p><p> The young minister, who was a graduate of a Lutheran seminary atSpringfield, Ohio, and had come out of college with a very serious outlookon life, took Sam to his house and together they sat talking half thenight. He had a wife, a country girl with a babe lying at her breast, whogot supper for them, and who, after supper, sat in the shadows in a cornerof the living-room listening to their talk.</p><p> The two men sat together. Sam smoked his pipe and the minister poked at acoal fire that burned in a stove. They talked of God and of what thethought of God meant to men; but the young minister did not try to giveSam an answer to his problem; on the contrary, Sam found him strikinglydissatisfied and unhappy in his way of life.</p><p> "There is no spirit of God here," he said, poking viciously at the coalsin the stove. "The people here do not want me to talk to them of God. Theyhave no curiosity about what He wants of them nor of why He has put themhere. They want me to tell them of a city in the sky, a kind of glorifiedDayton, Ohio, to which they can go when they have finished this life ofwork and of putting money in the savings bank."</p><p> For several days Sam stayed with the clergyman, driving about the countrywith him and talking of God. In the evening they sat in the house,continuing their talks, and on Sunday Sam went to hear the man preach inhis church.</p><p> The sermon was a disappointment to Sam. Although his host had talkedvigorously and well in private, his public address was stilted andunnatural.</p><p> "The man," thought Sam, "has no feeling for public address and is nottreating his people well in not giving them, without reservation, theideas he has expounded to me in his house." He decided there was somethingto be said for the people who sat patiently listening week after week andwho gave the man the means of a living for so lame an effort.</p><p> One evening when Sam had been with them for a week the young wife came tohim as he stood on the little porch before the house.</p><p> "I wish you would go away," she said, standing with her babe in her armsand looking at the porch floor. "You stir him up and make himdissatisfied."</p><p> Sam stepped off the porch and hurried off up the road into the darkness.There had been tears in the wife's eyes.</p><p> In June he went with a threshing crew, working among labourers and eatingwith them in the fields or about the crowded tables of farmhouses wherethey stopped to thresh. Each day Sam and the men with him worked in a newplace and had as helpers the farmer for whom they threshed and several ofhis neighbours. The farmers worked at a killing pace and the men of thethreshing crew were expected to keep abreast of each new lot of them dayafter day. At night the threshermen, too weary for talk, crept into theloft of a barn, slept until daylight and then began another day ofheartbreaking toil. On Sunday morning they went for a swim in some creekand in the afternoon sat in a barn or under the trees of an orchardsleeping or indulging in detached, fragmentary bits of talk, talk thatnever rose above a low, wearisome level. For hours they would try tosettle a dispute as to whether a horse they had seen at some farm duringthe week had three, or four, white feet, and one man in the crew nevertalked at all, sitting on his heels through the long Sunday afternoons andwhittling at a stick with his pocket knife.</p><p> The threshing outfit with which Sam worked was owned by a man named Joe,who was in debt for it to the maker and who, after working with the menall day, drove about the country half the night making deals with farmersfor other days of threshing. Sam thought that he looked constantly on thepoint of collapse through overwork and worry, and one of the men, who hadbeen with Joe through several seasons, told Sam that at the end of theseason their employer did not have enough money left from his season ofwork to pay the interest on the debt for his machines and that hecontinually took jobs for less than the cost of doing them.</p><p> "One has to keep going," said Joe, when one day Sam began talking to himon the matter.</p><p> When told to keep Sam's wage until the end of the season he lookedrelieved and at the end of the season came to Sam, looking more worriedand said that he had no money.</p><p> "I will give you a note bearing good interest if you can let me have alittle time," he said.</p><p> Sam took the note and looked at the pale, drawn face peering out of himfrom the shadows at the back of the barn.</p><p> "Why do you not drop the whole thing and begin working for some one else?"he asked.</p><p> Joe looked indignant.</p><p> "A man wants independence," he said.</p><p> When Sam got again upon the road he stopped at a little bridge over astream, and tearing up Joe's note watched the torn pieces of it float awayupon the brown water.</p><h2>Book III - Chapter 3</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> Through the summer and early fall Sam continued his wanderings. The dayson which something happened or on which something outside himselfinterested or attracted him were special days, giving him food for hoursof thought, but for the most part he walked on and on for weeks, sunk in akind of healing lethargy of physical fatigue. Always he tried to get atpeople who came into his way and to discover something of their way oflife and the end toward which they worked, and many an open-mouthed,staring man and woman he left behind him on the road and on the sidewalksof the villages. He had one principle of action; whenever an idea cameinto his mind he did not hesitate, but began trying at once thepracticability of living by following the idea, and although the practicebrought him to no end and only seemed to multiply the difficulties of theproblem he was striving to work out, it brought him many strangeexperiences.</p><p> At one time he was for several days a bartender in a saloon in a town ineastern Ohio. The saloon was in a small wooden building facing a railroadtrack and Sam had gone in there with a labourer met on the sidewalk. Itwas a stormy night in September at the end of his first year of wanderingand while he stood by a roaring coal stove, after buying drinks for thelabourer and cigars for himself, several men came in and stood by the bardrinking together. As they drank they became more and more friendly,slapping each other on the back, singing songs and boasting. One of themgot out upon the floor and danced a jig. The proprietor, a round-faced manwith one dead eye, who had himself been drinking freely, put a bottle uponthe bar and coming up to Sam, began complaining that he had no bartenderand had to work long hours.</p><p> "Drink what you want, boys, and then I'll tell you what you owe," he saidto the men standing along the bar.</p><p> Watching the men who drank and played like school boys about the room, andlooking at the bottle sitting on the bar, the contents of which had forthe moment taken the sombre dulness out of the lives of the workmen, Samsaid to himself, "I will take up this trade. It may appeal to me. At leastI shall be selling forgetfulness and not be wasting my life with thistramping on the road and thinking."</p><p> The saloon in which he worked was a profitable one and although in anobscure place had made its proprietor what is called "well fixed." It hada side door opening into an alley and one went up this alley to the mainstreet of the town. The front door looking upon the railroad tracks wasbut little used, perhaps at the noon hour two or three young men from thefreight depot down the tracks would come in by it and stand about drinkingbeer, but the trade that came down the alley and in at the side door wasprodigious. All day long men hurried in at this door, took drinks andhurried out again, looking up the alley and running quickly when theyfound the way clear. These men all drank whiskey, and when Sam had workedfor a few days in the place he once made the mistake of reaching for thebottle when he heard the door open.</p><p> "Let them ask for it," said the proprietor gruffly. "Do you want to insulta man?"</p><p> On Saturday the place was filled all day with beer-drinking farmers, andat odd hours on other days men came in, whimpering and begging drinks.When alone in the place, Sam looked at the trembling fingers of these menand put the bottle before them, saying, "Drink all you want of the stuff."</p><p> When the proprietor was in, the men who begged drinks stood a moment bythe stove and then went out thrusting their hands into their coat pocketsand looking at the floor.</p><p> "Bar flies," the proprietor explained laconically.</p><p> The whiskey was horrible. The proprietor mixed it himself and put it intostone jars that stood under the bar, pouring it out of these into bottlesas they became empty. He kept on display in glass cases bottles of wellknown brands of whiskey, but when a man came in and asked for one of thesebrands Sam handed him a bottle bearing that label from beneath the bar, abottle previously filled by Al from the jugs of his own mixture. As Alsold no mixed drinks Sam was compelled to know nothing the bartender's artand stood all day handing out Al's poisonous stuff and the foaming glassesof beer the workingmen drank in the evening.</p><p> Of the men coming in at the side door, a shoe merchant, a grocer, theproprietor of a restaurant, and a telegraph operator interested Sam most.Several times each day these men would appear, glance back over theirshoulders at the door, and then turning to the bar would look at Samapologetically.</p><p> "Give me a little out of the bottle, I have a bad cold," they would say,as though repeating a formula.</p><p> At the end of the week Sam was on the road again. The rather bizarrenotion that by staying there he would be selling forgetfulness of life'sunhappiness had been dispelled during his first day's duty, and hiscuriosity concerning the customers was his undoing. As the men came in atthe side door and stood before him Sam leaned over the bar and asked themwhy they drank. Some of the men laughed, some swore at him, and thetelegraph operator reported the matter to Al, calling Sam's question animpertinence.</p><p> "You fool, don't you know better than to be throwing stones at the bar?"Al roared, and with an oath discharged him.</p><p> </p><h2>Book III - Chapter 4</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> One fine warm morning in the fall Sam was sitting in a little park in thecentre of a Pennsylvania manufacturing town watching men and women goingthrough the quiet streets to the factories and striving to overcome afeeling of depression aroused by an experience of the evening before. Hehad come into town over a poorly made clay road running through barrenhills, and, depressed and weary, had stood on the shores of a river,swollen by the early fall rains, that flowed along the edges of the town.</p><p> Before him in the distance he had looked into the windows of a hugefactory, the black smoke from which added to the gloom of the scene thatlay before him. Through the windows of the factory, dimly seen, workersran here and there, appearing and disappearing, the glare of the furnacefire lighting now one, now another of them, sharply. At his feet thetumbling waters that rolled and pitched over a little dam fascinated him.Looking closely at the racing waters his head, light from physicalweariness, reeled, and in fear of falling he had been compelled to gripfirmly the small tree against which he leaned. In the back yard of a houseacross the stream from Sam and facing the factory four guinea hens sat ona board fence, their weird, plaintive cries making a peculiarly fittingaccompaniment to the scene that lay before him, and in the yard itself twobedraggled fowls fought each other. Again and again they sprang into thefray, striking out with bills and spurs. Becoming exhausted, they fell topicking and scratching among the rubbish in the yard, and when they had alittle recovered renewed the struggle. For an hour Sam had looked at thescene, letting his eyes wander from the river to the grey sky and to thefactory belching forth its black smoke. He had thought that the two feeblystruggling fowls, immersed in their pointless struggle in the midst ofsuch mighty force, epitomised much of man's struggle in the world, and,turning, had gone along the sidewalks and to the village hotel, feelingold and tired. Now on the bench in the little park, with the early morningsun shining down through the glistening rain drops clinging to the redleaves of the trees, he began to lose the sense of depression that hadclung to him through the night.</p><p> A young man who walked in the park saw him idly watching the hurryingworkers, and stopped to sit beside him.</p><p> "On the road, brother?" he asked.</p><p> Sam shook his head, and the other began talking.</p><p> "Fools and slaves," he said earnestly, pointing to the men and womenpassing on the sidewalk. "See them going like beasts to their bondage?What do they get for it? What kind of lives do they lead? The lives ofdogs."</p><p> He looked at Sam for approval of the sentiment he had voiced.</p><p> "We are all fools and slaves," said Sam, stoutly.</p><p> Jumping to his feet the young man began waving his arms about.</p><p> "There, you talk sense," he cried. "Welcome to our town, stranger. We haveno thinkers here. The workers are like dogs. There is no solidarity amongthem. Come and have breakfast with me."</p><p> In the restaurant the young man began talking of himself. He was agraduate of the University of Pennsylvania. His father had died while hewas yet in school and had left him a modest fortune, upon the income ofwhich he lived with his mother. He did no work and was enormously proud ofthe fact.</p><p> "I refuse to work! I scorn it!" he declared, shaking a breakfast roll inthe air.</p><p> Since leaving school he had devoted himself to the cause of the socialistparty in his native town, and boasted of the leadership he had alreadyachieved. His mother, he declared, was disturbed and worried because ofhis connection with the movement.</p><p> "She wants me to be respectable," he said sadly, and added, "What's theuse trying to explain to a woman? I can't get her to see the differencebetween a socialist and a direct-action anarchist and I've given uptrying. She expects me to end by blowing somebody up with dynamite or bygetting into jail for throwing bricks at the borough police."</p><p> He talked of a strike going on among some girl employs of a Jewishshirtwaist factory in the town, and Sam, immediately interested, beganasking questions, and after breakfast went with his new acquaintance tothe scene of the strike.</p><p> The shirtwaist factory was located in a loft above a grocery store, and onthe sidewalk in front of the store three girl pickets were walking up anddown. A flashily dressed Hebrew, with a cigar in his mouth and his handsin his trousers pockets, stood in the stairway leading to the loft andlooked closely at the young socialist and Sam. From his lips came a streamof vile words which he pretended to be addressing to the empty air. WhenSam walked towards him he turned and ran up the stairs, shouting oathsover his shoulder.</p><p> Sam joined the three girls, and began talking to them, walking up and downwith them before the grocery store.</p><p> "What are you doing to win?" he asked when they had told him of theirgrievances.</p><p> "We do what we can!" said a Jewish girl with broad hips, great motherlybreasts, and fine, soft, brown eyes, who appeared to be a leader andspokesman among the strikers. "We walk up and down here and try to get aword with the strikebreakers the boss has brought in from other towns,when they go in and come out."</p><p> Frank, the University man, spoke up. "We are putting up stickerseverywhere," he said. "I myself have put up hundreds of them."</p><p> He took from his coat pocket a printed slip, gummed on one side, and toldSam that he had been putting them on walls and telegraph poles about town.The thing was vilely written. "Down with the dirty scabs" was the headingin bold, black letters across the top.</p><p> Sam was shocked at the vileness of the caption and at the crude brutalityof the text printed on the slip.</p><p> "Do you call women workers names like that?" he asked.</p><p> "They have taken our work from us," the Jewish girl answered simply andbegan again, telling the story of her sister strikers and of what the lowwage had meant to them and to their families. "To me it does not so muchmatter; I have a brother who works in a clothing store and he can supportme, but many of the women in our union have only their wage here withwhich to feed their families."</p><p> Sam's mind began working on the problem.</p><p> "Here," he declared, "is something definite to do, a battle in which Iwill pit myself against this employer for the sake of these women."</p><p> He put away from him his experience in the Illinois town, telling himselfthat the young woman walking beside him would have a sense of honourunknown to the red-haired young workman who had sold him out to Bill andEd.</p><p> "I failed with my money," he thought, "now I will try to help these girlswith my energy."</p><p> Turning to the Jewish girl he made a quick decision.</p><p> "I will help you get your places back," he said.</p><p> Leaving the girls he went across the street to a barber shop where hecould watch the entrance to the factory. He wanted to think out a methodof procedure and wanted also to look at the girl strikebreakers as theycame to work. After a time several girls came along the street and turnedin at the stairway. The flashily dressed Hebrew with the cigar still inhis mouth was again by the stairway entrance. The three pickets runningforward accosted the file of girls going up the stairs, one of whom, ayoung American girl with yellow hair, turned and shouted something overher shoulder. The man called Frank shouted back and the Hebrew took thecigar out of his mouth and laughed heartily. Sam filled and lighted hispipe, a dozen plans for helping the striking girls running through hismind.</p><p> During the morning he went into the grocery store on the corner, a saloonin the neighbourhood, and returned to the barber shop talking to men ofthe strike. He ate his lunch alone, still thinking of the three girlspatiently walking up and down before the stairway. Their ceaseless walkingseemed to him a useless waste of energy.</p><p> "They should be doing something more definite," he thought.</p><p> After lunch he joined the soft-eyed Jewish girl and together they walkedalong the street talking of the strike.</p><p> "You cannot win this strike by just calling nasty names," he said. "I donot like that 'dirty scab' sticker Frank had in his pocket. It cannot helpyou and only antagonises the girls who have taken your places. Here inthis part of town the people want to see you win. I have talked to the menwho come into the saloon and the barber shop across the street and youalready have their sympathy. You want to get the sympathy of the girls whohave taken your places. Calling them dirty scabs only makes martyrs ofthem. Did the yellow-haired girl call you a name this morning?"</p><p> The Jewish girl looked at Sam and laughed bitterly.</p><p> "Rather; she called me a loud-mouthed street walker."</p><p> They continued their walk along the street, across the railroad track anda bridge, and into a quiet residence street. Carriages stood at the curbbefore the houses, and pointing to these and to the well-kept houses Samsaid, "Men have bought these things for their women."</p><p> A shadow fell across the girl's face.</p><p> "I suppose all of us want what these women have," she answered. "We do notreally want to fight and to stand on our own feet, not when we know theworld. What a woman really wants is a man," she added shortly.</p><p> Sam began talking and told her of a plan that had come into his mind. Hehad remembered how Jack Prince and Morrison used to talk about the appealof the direct personal letter and how effectively it was used by mailorder houses.</p><p> "We will have a mail order strike here," he said and went on to lay beforeher the details of his plan. He proposed that she, Frank, and some othersof the striking girls, should go about town getting the names and the mailaddresses of the girl strikebreakers.</p><p> "Get also the names of the keepers of the boarding houses at which thesegirls live and the names of the men and women who live in the samehouses," he suggested. "Then you get the striking girls and women togetherand have them tell me their stories. We will write letters day after dayto the girl strikebreakers, to the women who keep the boarding houses, andto the people who live in the houses and sit at table with them. We won'tcall names. We will tell the story of what being beaten in this fightmeans to the women in your union, tell it simply and truthfully as youtold it to me this morning."</p><p> "It will cost such a lot," said the Jewish girl, shaking her head.</p><p> Sam took a roll of bills from his pocket and showed it to her.</p><p> "I will pay," he said.</p><p> "Why?" she asked, looking at him sharply.</p><p> "Because I am a man wanting work just as you want work," he replied, andthen went on hurriedly, "It is a long story. I am a rich man wanderingabout the world seeking Truth. I will not want that known. Take me forgranted. You won't be sorry."</p><p> Within an hour he had engaged a large room, paying a month's rent inadvance, and into the room chairs and table and typewriters had beenbrought. He put an advertisement in the evening paper for girlstenographers, and a printer, hurried by a promise of extra pay, ran outfor him several thousand letter heads across the top of which in bold,black type ran the words, "The Girl Strikers."</p><p> That night Sam held, in the room he had engaged, a meeting of the girlstrikers, explaining to them his plan and offering to pay all expenses ofthe fight he proposed to make for them. They clapped their hands andshouted approvingly, and Sam began laying out his campaign.</p><p> One of the girls he told off to stand in front of the factory morning andevening.</p><p> "I will have other help for you there," he said. "Before you go home tonight there will be a printer here with a bundle of pamphlets I am havingprinted for you."</p><p> Advised by the soft-eyed Jewish girl, he told off others to get additionalnames for the mailing list he wanted, getting many important ones fromgirls in the room. Six of the girls he asked to come in the morning tohelp him with addressing and mailing letters. The Jewish girl he told totake charge of the girls at work in the room--on the morrow to become alsoan office--and to superintend getting the names.</p><p> Frank rose at the back of the room.</p><p> "Who are you anyway?" he asked.</p><p> "A man with money and the ability to win this strike," Sam told him.</p><p> "What are you doing it for?" demanded Frank.</p><p> The Jewish girl sprang to her feet.</p><p> "Because he believes in these women and wants to help," she explained.</p><p> "Rot," said Frank, going out at the door.</p><p> It was snowing when the meeting ended, and Sam and the Jewish girlfinished their talk in the hallway leading to her room.</p><p> "I don't know what Harrigan, the union leader from Pittsburgh, will say tothis," she told him. "He appointed Frank to lead and direct the strikehere. He doesn't like interference and he may not like your plan. But weworking women need men, men like you who can plan and do things. There aretoo many men living on us. We need men who will work for all of us as themen work for the women in the carriages and automobiles." She laughed andput out a hand to him. "See what you have got yourself into? I want you tobe a husband to our entire union."</p><p> The next morning four girl stenographers went to work in Sam's strikeheadquarters, and he wrote his first strike letter, a letter telling thestory of a striking girl named Hadaway, whose young brother was sick withtuberculosis. Sam did not put any flourishes in the letter; he felt thathe did not need to. He thought that with twenty or thirty such letters,each telling briefly and truthfully the story of one of the strikinggirls, he should be able to show one American town how its other halflived. He gave the letter to the four girl stenographers with the mailinglist he already had and started them writing it to each of the names.</p><p> At eight o'clock a man came in to install a telephone and girl strikersbegan bringing in new names for the mailing list. At nine o'clock threemore stenographers appeared and were put to work, and girls who had beenin began sending more names over the 'phone. The Jewish girl walked up anddown, giving orders, making suggestions. From time to time she ran toSam's desk and suggested other sources of names for the mailing list. Samthought that if the other working girls were timid and embarrassed beforehim this one was not. She was like a general on the field of battle. Hersoft brown eyes glowed, her mind worked rapidly, and her voice had a ringin it. At her suggestion Sam gave the girls at the typewriters listsbearing the names of town officials, bankers and prominent business men,and the wives of all these, also presidents of various women's clubs,society women, and charitable organizations. She called reporters from thetown's two daily papers and had them interview Sam, and at her suggestionhe gave them copies of the Hadaway girl letter to print.</p><p> "Print it," he said, "and if you cannot use it as news, make it anadvertisement and bring the bill to me."</p><p> At eleven o'clock Frank came into the room bringing a tall Irishman, withsunken cheeks, black, unclean teeth, and an overcoat too small for him.Leaving him standing by the door, Frank walked across the room to Sam.</p><p> "Come to lunch with us," he said. He jerked his thumb over his shouldertoward the tall Irishman. "I picked him up," he said. "Best brain that'sbeen in town for years. He's a wonder. Used to be a Catholic priest. Hedoesn't believe in God or love or anything. Come on out and hear him talk.He's great."</p><p> Sam shook his head.</p><p> "I am too busy. There is work to be done here. We are going to win thisstrike."</p><p> Frank looked at him doubtfully and then about the room at the busy girls.</p><p> "I don't know what Harrigan will think of all this," he said. "He doesn'tlike interferences. I never do anything without writing him. I wrote andtold him what you were doing here. I had to, you know. I'm responsible toheadquarters."</p><p> In the afternoon the Hebrew owner of the shirtwaist factory came in tostrike headquarters and, walking through the room took off his hat and satdown by Sam's desk.</p><p> "What do you want here?" he asked. "The newspaper boys told me of what youhad planned to do. What's your game?"</p><p> "I want to whip you," Sam answered quietly, "to whip you good. You mightas well get into line. You are going to lose this strike."</p><p> "I'm only one," said the Hebrew. "There is an association of usmanufacturers of shirtwaists. We are all in this. We all have a strike onour hands. What will you gain if you do beat me here? I'm only a littlefellow after all."</p><p> Sam laughed and picking up his pen began writing.</p><p> "You are unlucky," he said. "I just happened to take hold here. When Ihave you beaten I will go on and beat the others. There is more money backof me than back of you all, and I am going to beat every one of you."</p><p> The next morning a crowd stood before the stairway leading to the factorywhen the strikebreaking girls came to work. The letters and the newspaperinterview had been effective and more than half the strikebreakers did notappear. The others hurried along the street and turned in at the stairwaywithout looking at the crowd. The girl, told off by Sam, stood on thesidewalk passing out pamphlets to the strikebreakers. The pamphlets wereheaded, "The Story of Ten Girls," and told briefly and pointedly thestories of ten striking girls and what the loss of the strike meant tothem and to their families.</p><p> After a while there drove up two carriages and a large automobile, and outof the automobile climbed a well-dressed woman who took a bundle of thepamphlets from the girl picket and began passing them about among thepeople. Two policemen who stood in front of the crowd took off theirhelmets and accompanied her. The crowd cheered. Frank came hurrying acrossthe street to where Sam stood in front of the barber shop and slapped himon the back.</p><p> "You're a wonder," he said.</p><p> Sam hurried back to the room and prepared the second letter for themailing list. Two more stenographers had come to work. He had to send outfor more machines. A reporter for the town's evening paper ran up thestairway.</p><p> "Who are you?" he asked. "The town wants to know."</p><p> From his pocket he took a telegram from a Pittsburgh daily.</p><p> "What about mail-order strike plan? Give name and story new strike leaderthere."</p><p> At ten o'clock Frank returned.</p><p> "There's a wire from Harrigan," he said. "He's coming here. He wants amass meeting of the girls for to-night. I've got to get them together.We'll meet here in this room."</p><p> In the room the work went on. The list of names for the mailing haddoubled. The picket at the shirtwaist factory reported that three more ofthe strikebreakers had left the plant. The Jewish girl was excited. Shewent hurrying about the room, her eyes glowing.</p><p> "It's great," she said. "The plan is working. The whole town is arousedand for us. We'll win in another twenty-four hours."</p><p> And then at seven o'clock that night Harrigan came into the room where Samsat with the assembled girls, bolting the door behind him. He was a short,strongly built man with blue eyes and red hair. He walked about the roomin silence, followed by Frank. Suddenly he stopped and, picking up one ofthe typewriting machines rented by Sam for the letter writing, raised itabove his head and sent it smashing to the floor.</p><p> "A hell of a strike leader," he roared. "Look at this. Scab machines!</p><p> "Scab stenographers!" he said through his teeth. "Scab printing! Scabeverything!"</p><p> Picking up a bundle of the letterheads, he tore them across, and walkingto the front of the room, shook his fist before Sam's face.</p><p> "Scab leader!" he shouted, turning and facing the girls.</p><p> The soft-eyed Jewish girl sprang to her feet.</p><p> "He's winning for us," she said.</p><p> Harrigan walked toward her threateningly.</p><p> "Better lose than win a scab victory," he bellowed.</p><p> "Who are you anyway? What grafter sent you here?" he demanded, turning toSam.</p><p> He launched into a speech. "I have been watching this fellow, I know him.He has a scheme to break down the union and is being paid by thecapitalists."</p><p> Sam waited to hear no more. Getting up he pulled on his canvas jacket andstarted for the door. He saw that already he had involved himself in adozen violations of the unionist code and the idea of trying to convinceHarrigan of his disinterestedness did not occur to him.</p><p> "Do not mind me," he said, "I am going."</p><p> He walked between the rows of frightened, white-faced girls and unboltedthe door, the Jewish girl following. At the head of the stairway leadingto the street he stopped and pointed back into the room.</p><p> "Go back," he said, handing her a roll of bills. "Carry on the work if youcan. Get other machines and new printing. I will help you in secret."</p><p> Turning he ran down the stairs, hurried through the curious crowd standingat the foot, and walked rapidly along in front of the lighted stores. Acold rain, half snow, was falling. Beside him walked a young man with abrown pointed beard, one of the newspaper reporters who had interviewedhim the day before.</p><p> "Did Harrigan trim you?" asked the young man, and then added, laughing,"He told us he intended to throw you down stairs."</p><p> Sam walked on in silence, filled with wrath. He turned into a side streetand stopped when his companion put a hand upon his arm.</p><p> "This is our dump," said the young man, pointing to a long low framebuilding facing the side street. "Come in and let us have your story. Itshould be a good one."</p><p> Inside the newspaper office another young man sat with his head lying on aflat-top desk. He was clad in a strikingly flashy plaid coat, had a littlewizened, good-natured face and seemed to have been drinking. The young manwith the beard explained Sam's identity, taking the sleeping man by theshoulder and shaking him vigorously.</p><p> "Wake up, Skipper! There's a good story here!" he shouted. "The union hasthrown out the mail-order strike leader!"</p><p> The Skipper got to his feet and began shaking his head.</p><p> "Of course, of course, Old Top, they would throw you out. You've got somebrains. No man with brains can lead a strike. It's against the laws ofNature. Something was bound to hit you. Did Roughneck come out fromPittsburgh?" he asked, turning to the young man of the brown beard.</p><p> Then reaching above his head and taking a cap that matched his plaid coatfrom a nail on the wall, he winked at Sam. "Come on, Old Top. I've got toget a drink."</p><p> The two men went through a side door and down a dark alley, going in atthe back door of a saloon. Mud lay deep in the alley and The Skippersloshed through it, splattering Sam's clothes and face. In the saloon at atable facing Sam, with a bottle of French wine between them, he beganexplaining.</p><p> "I've a note coming due at the bank in the morning and no money to payit," he said. "When I have a note coming due I always have no money and Ialways get drunk. Then next morning I pay the note. I don't know how I doit, but I always come out all right. It's a system--Now about thisstrike." He plunged into a discussion of the strike while men came in andout, laughing and drinking. At ten o'clock the proprietor locked the frontdoor, drew the curtain, and coming to the back of the room sat down at thetable with Sam and The Skipper, bringing another bottle of the French winefrom which the two men continued drinking.</p><p> "That man from Pittsburgh busted up your place, eh?" he said, turning toSam. "A man came in here to-night and told me. He sent for the typewriterpeople and made them take away the machines."</p><p> When they were ready to leave, Sam took money from his pocket and offeredto pay for the bottle of French wine ordered by The Skipper, who arose andstood unsteadily on his feet.</p><p> "Do you mean to insult me?" he demanded indignantly, throwing a twentydollar bill on the table. The proprietor gave him back only fourteendollars.</p><p> "I might as well wipe off the slate while you're flush," he observed,winking at Sam.</p><p> The Skipper sat down again, taking a pencil and pad of paper from hispocket, and throwing them on the table.</p><p> "I want an editorial on the strike for the Old Rag," he said to Sam. "Doone for me. Do something strong. Get a punch into it. I want to talk to myfriend here."</p><p> Putting the pad of paper on the table Sam began writing his newspapereditorial. His head seemed wonderfully clear, his command of wordsunusually good. He called the attention of the public to the situation,the struggles of the striking girls and the intelligent fight they hadbeen making to win a just cause, following this with paragraphs pointingout how the effectiveness of the work done had been annulled by theposition taken by the labour and socialist leaders.</p><p> "These fellows at bottom care nothing for results," he wrote. "They arenot thinking of the unemployed women with families to support, they arethinking only of themselves and their puny leadership which they fear isthreatened. Now we shall have the usual exhibition of all the old things,struggle, and hatred and defeat."</p><p> When he had finished The Skipper and Sam went back through the alley tothe newspaper office. The Skipper sloshed again through the mud andcarried in his hand a bottle of red gin. At his desk he took the editorialfrom Sam's hands and read it.</p><p> "Perfect! Perfect to the thousandth part of an inch, Old Top," he said,pounding Sam on the shoulder. "Just what the Old Rag wanted to say aboutthe strike." Then climbing upon the desk and putting the plaid coat underhis head he went peacefully to sleep, and Sam, sitting beside the desk ina shaky office chair, slept also. At daybreak a black man with a broom inhis hand woke them, and going into a long low room filled with presses TheSkipper put his head under a water tap and came back waving a soiled toweland with water dripping from his hair.</p><p> "Now for the day and the labours thereof," he said, grinning at Sam andtaking a long drink out of the gin bottle.</p><p> After breakfast he and Sam took up their stand in front of the barber shopopposite the stairway leading to the shirtwaist factory. Sam's girl withthe pamphlets was gone as was also the soft-eyed Jewish girl, and in theirplaces Frank and the Pittsburgh leader named Harrigan walked up and down.Again carriages and automobiles stood by the curb, and again a welldressed woman got out of a machine and went toward three striking girlsapproaching along the sidewalk. The woman was met by Harrigan, shaking hisfist and shouting, and getting back into the machine she drove off. Fromthe stairway the flashily-dressed Hebrew looked at the crowd and laughed.</p><p> "Where is the new strike leader--the mail-order strike leader?" he calledto Frank.</p><p> With the words, a working man with a dinner pail on his arm ran out of thecrowd and knocked the Jew back into the stairway.</p><p> "Punch him! Punch the dirty scab leader!" yelled Frank, dancing up anddown on the sidewalk.</p><p> Two policemen running forward began leading the workingman up the street,his dinner pail still clutched in one hand.</p><p> "I know something," The Skipper shouted, pounding Sam on the shoulder. "Iknow who will sign that note with me. The woman Harrigan drove back intoher machine is the richest woman in town. I will show her your editorial.She will think I wrote it and it will get her. You'll see." He ran off upthe street, shouting back over his shoulder, "Come over to the dump, Iwant to see you again."</p><p> Sam returned to the newspaper office and sat down waiting for The Skipperwho, after a time, came in, took off his coat and began writing furiously.From time to time he took long drinks out of the bottle of red gin, andafter silently offering it to Sam, continued reeling off sheet after sheetof loosely-written matter.</p><p> "I got her to sign the note," he called over his shoulder to Sam. "She wasfurious at Harrigan and when I told her we were going to attack him anddefend you she fell for it quick. I won out by following my system. Ialways get drunk and it always wins."</p><p> At ten o'clock the newspaper office was in a ferment. The little man withthe brown pointed beard, and another, kept running to The Skipper askingadvice, laying typewritten sheets before him, talking as he wrote.</p><p> "Give me a lead. I want one more front page lead," The Skipper keptbawling at them, working like mad.</p><p> At ten thirty the door opened and Harrigan, accompanied by Frank, came in.Seeing Sam they stopped, looking at him uncertainly, and at the man atwork at the desk.</p><p> "Well, speak up. This is no ladies' reception room. What do you fellowswant?" snapped The Skipper, glaring at them.</p><p> Frank, coming forward, laid a typewritten sheet on the desk, which thenewspaper man read hurriedly.</p><p> "Will you use it?" asked Frank.</p><p> The Skipper laughed.</p><p> "Wouldn't change a word of it," he shouted. "Sure I'll use it. It's what Iwanted to make my point. You fellows watch me."</p><p> Frank and Harrigan went out and The Skipper, rushing to the door, beganyelling into the room beyond.</p><p> "Hey, you Shorty and Tom, I've got that last lead."</p><p> Coming back to his desk he began writing again, grinning as he worked. ToSam he handed the typewritten sheet prepared by Frank.</p><p> "Dastardly attempt to win the cause of the working girls by dirty scableaders and butter-fingered capitalist class," it began, and after thisfollowed a wild jumble of words, words without meaning, sentences withoutpoint in which Sam was called a mealy-mouthed mail-order musser and TheSkipper was mentioned incidentally as a pusillanimous ink slinger.</p><p> "I'll run the stuff and comment on it," declared The Skipper, handing Samwhat he had written. It was an editorial inviting the public to read thearticle prepared for publication by the strike leaders and sympathisingwith the striking girls that their cause had to be lost because of theincompetence and lack of intelligence of their leaders.</p><p> "Hurrah for Roughhouse, the brave man who leads working girls to defeat inorder that he may retain leadership and drive intelligent effort out ofthe cause of labour," wrote The Skipper.</p><p> Sam looked at the sheets and out of the window where a snow storm raged.It seemed to him that a crime was being done and he was sick and disgustedat his own inability to stop it. The Skipper lighted a short black pipeand took his cap from a nail on the wall.</p><p> "I'm the smoothest little newspaper thing in town and some financier aswell," he declared. "Let's go have a drink."</p><p> After the drink Sam walked through the town toward the country. At theedge of town where the houses became scattered and the road started todrop away into a deep valley some one helloed behind him. Turning, he sawthe soft-eyed Jewish girl running along a path beside the road.</p><p> "Where are you going?" he asked, stopping to lean against a board fence,the snow falling upon his face.</p><p> "I'm going with you," said the girl. "You're the best and the strongestman I've ever seen and I'm not going to let you get away. If you've got awife it don't matter. She isn't what she should be or you wouldn't bewalking about the country alone. Harrigan and Frank say you're crazy, butI know better. I am going with you and I'm going to help you find what youwant."</p><p> Sam wondered. She took a roll of bills from a pocket in her dress and gaveit to him.</p><p> "I spent three hundred and fourteen dollars," she said.</p><p> They stood looking at each other. She put out a hand and laid it on hisarm. Her eyes, soft and now glowing with eager light looked into his. Herround breasts rose and fell.</p><p> "Anywhere you say. I'll be your servant if you ask it of me."</p><p> A wave of hot desire ran through Sam followed by a quick reaction. Hethought of his months of weary seeking and his universal failure.</p><p> "You are going back to town if I have to drive you there with stones," hetold her, and turning ran down the valley leaving her standing by theboard fence, her head buried in her arms.</p><h2>Book III - Chapter 5</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> One crisp winter evening Sam found himself on a busy street corner inRochester, N.Y., watching from a doorway the crowds of people hurrying orloitering past him. He stood in a doorway near a corner that seemed to bea public meeting place and from all sides came men and women who met atthe corner, stood for a moment in talk, and then went away together. Samfound himself beginning to wonder about the meetings. In the year since hehad walked out of the Chicago office his mind had grown more and morereflective. Little things--a smile on the lips of an ill-clad old manmumbling and hurrying past him on the street, or the flutter of a child'shand from the doorway of a farmhouse--had furnished him food for hours ofthought. Now he watched with interest the little incidents; the nods, thehand clasps, the hurried stealthy glances around of the men and women whomet for a moment at the corner. On the sidewalk near his doorway severalmiddle-aged men, evidently from a large hotel around the corner, wereeyeing, with unpleasant, hungry, furtive eyes the women in the crowd.</p><p> A large blond woman stepped into the doorway beside Sam. "Waiting for someone?" she asked, smiling and looking steadily at him, with the harried,uncertain, hungry light he had seen in the eyes of the middle-aged menupon the sidewalk.</p><p> "What are you doing here with your husband at work?" he ventured.</p><p> She looked startled and then laughed.</p><p> "Why don't you hit me with your fist if you want to jolt me like that?"she demanded, adding, "I don't know who you are, but whoever you are Iwant to tell you that I've quit my husband."</p><p> "Why?" asked Sam.</p><p> She laughed again and stepping over looked at him closely.</p><p> "I guess you're bluffing," she said. "I don't believe you know Alf at all.And I'm glad you don't. I've quit Alf, but he would raise Cain just thesame, if he saw me out here hustling."</p><p> Sam stepped out of the doorway and walked down a side street past alighted theatre. Along the street women raised their eyes to him andbeyond the theatre, a young girl, brushing against him, muttered, "Hello,Sport!"</p><p> Sam wanted to get away from the unhealthy, hungry look he had seen in theeyes of the men and women. His mind began working on this side of thelives of great numbers of people in the cities--of the men and women onthe street corner, of the woman who from the security of a safe marriagehad once thrown a challenge into his eyes as they sat together in thetheatre, and of the thousand little incidents in the lives of all moderncity men and women. He wondered how much that eager, aching hunger stoodin the way of men's getting hold of life and living it earnestly andpurposefully, as he wanted to live it, and as he felt all men and womenwanted at bottom to live it. When he was a boy in Caxton he was more thanonce startled by the flashes of brutality and coarseness in the speech andactions of kindly, well-meaning men; now as he walked in the streets ofthe city he thought that he had got past being startled. "It is a qualityof our lives," he decided. "American men and women have not learned to beclean and noble and natural, like their forests and their wide, cleanplains."</p><p> He thought of what he had heard of London, and of Paris, and of othercities of the old world; and following an impulse acquired through hislonely wanderings, began talking to himself.</p><p> "We are no finer nor cleaner than these," he said, "and we sprang from thebig clean new land through which I have been walking all these months.Will mankind always go on with that old aching, queerly expressed hungerin its blood, and with that look in its eyes? Will it never shrive itselfand understand itself, and turn fiercely and energetically toward thebuilding of a bigger and cleaner race of men?"</p><p> "It won't unless you help," came the answer from some hidden part of him.</p><p> Sam fell to thinking of the men who write, and of those who teach, and hewondered why they did not, all of them, talk more thoughtfully of vice,and why they so often spent their talents and their energies in futileattacks upon some phase of life, and ended their efforts toward humanbetterment by joining or promoting a temperance league, or stopping theplaying of baseball on Sunday.</p><p> As a matter of fact were not many writers and reformers unconsciously inleague with the procurer, in that they treated vice and profligacy assomething, at bottom, charming? He himself had seen none of this vaguecharm.</p><p> "For me," he reflected, "there have been no Franois Villons or Sapphos inthe tenderloins of American cities. There have been instead only heartbreaking disease and ill health and poverty, and hard brutal faces andtorn, greasy finery."</p><p> He thought of men like Zola who saw this side of life clearly and how he,as a young fellow in the city, had read the man at Janet Eberly'ssuggestion and had been helped by him--helped and frightened and made tosee. And then there rose before him the leering face of a keeper of asecond-hand book store in Cleveland who some weeks before had pushedacross the counter to him a paper-covered copy of "Nana's Brother," sayingwith a smirk, "That's some sporty stuff." And he wondered what he shouldhave thought had he bought the book to feed the imagination thebookseller's comment was intended to arouse.</p><p> In the small towns through which Sam walked and in the small town in whichhe grew to manhood vice was openly crude and masculine. It went to sleepsprawling across a dirty beer-soaked table in Art Sherman's saloon inPiety Hollow, and the newsboy passed it without comment, regretting thatit slept and that it had no money with which to buy papers.</p><p> "Dissipation and vice get into the life of youth," he thought, coming to astreet corner where young men played pool and smoked cigarettes in a dingypoolroom, and turned back toward the heart of the city. "It gets into allmodern life. The farmer boy coming up to the city to work hears lewdstories in the smoking car of the train, and the travelling men from thecities tell tales of the city streets to the group about the stove invillage stores."</p><p> Sam did not quarrel with the fact that youth touched vice. Such thingswere a part of the world that men and women had made for their sons anddaughters to live in, and that night as he wandered in the streets ofRochester he thought that he would like all youth to know, if they couldbut know, truth. His heart was bitter at the thought of men throwing theglamour of romance over the sordid, ugly things he had been seeing in thatcity and in every city he had known.</p><p> Past him in a street lined with small frame houses stumbled a man far gonein drink, by whose side walked a boy, and Sam's mind leaped back to thosefirst years he had spent in the city and of the staggering old man he hadleft behind him in Caxton.</p><p> "You would think no man better armed against vice and dissipation thanthat painter's son of Caxton," he reminded himself, "and yet he embracedvice. He found, as all young men find, that there is much misleading talkand writing on the subject. The business men he knew did not part withable assistance because it did not sign the pledge. Ability was too rare athing and too independent to sign pledges, and the lips-that-touch-liquorshall-never-touch-mine sentiment among women was reserved for the lipsthat did not invite."</p><p> He began reviewing incidents of carouses he had been on with business menof his acquaintance, of a policeman knocked into a street and of himself,quiet and ably climbing upon tables to make speeches and to shout theinnermost secrets of his heart to drunken hangers-on in Chicago barrooms.Normally he had not been a good mixer. He had been one to keep himself tohimself. But on these carouses he let himself go, and got a reputation fordaring audacity by slapping men on the back and singing songs with them. Aglowing cordiality had pervaded him and for a time he had really believedthere was such a thing as high flying vice that glistens in the sun.</p><p> Now stumbling past lighted saloons, wandering unknown in a city's streets,he knew better. All vice was unclean, unhealthy.</p><p> He remembered a hotel in which he had once slept, a hotel that admittedquestionable couples. Its halls had become dingy; its windows remainedunopened; dirt gathered in the corners; the attendants shuffled as theywalked, and leered into the faces of creeping couples; the curtains at thewindows were torn and discoloured; strange snarling oaths, screams, andcries jarred the tense nerves; peace and cleanliness had fled the place;men hurried through the halls with hats drawn down over their faces;sunlight and fresh air and cheerful, whistling bellboys were locked out.</p><p> He thought of the weary, restless walks taken by the young men from farmsand country towns in the streets of the cities; young men believers in thegolden vice. Hands beckoned to them from doorways, and women of the townlaughed at their awkwardness. In Chicago he had walked in that way. Healso had been seeking, seeking the romantic, impossible mistress thatlurked at the bottom of men's tales of the submerged world. He wanted hisgolden girl. He was like the nave German lad in the South Water Streetwarehouses who had once said to him--he was a frugal soul--"I would liketo find a nice-looking girl who is quiet and modest and who will be mymistress and not charge anything."</p><p> Sam had not found his golden girl, and now he knew she did not exist. Hehad not seen the places called by the preachers the palaces of sin, andnow he knew there were no such places. He wondered why youth could not bemade to understand that sin is foul and that immorality reeks ofvulgarity. Why could not they be told plainly that there are nohousecleaning days in the tenderloin?</p><p> During his married life men had come to the house who discussed thismatter. One of them, he remembered, had maintained stoutly that thescarlet sisterhood was a necessity of modern life and that ordinary decentsocial life could not go on without it. Often during the past year Sam hadthought of the man's talk and his brain had reeled before the thought. Intowns and on country roads he had seen troops of little girls comelaughing and shouting out of school houses, and had wondered which of themwould be chosen for that service to mankind; and now, in his hour ofdepression, he wished that the man who had talked at his dinner tablemight be made to walk with him and to share with him his thoughts.</p><p> Turning again into a lighted busy thoroughfare of the city, Sam continuedhis study of the faces in the crowds. To do this quieted and soothed hismind. He began to feel a weariness in his legs and thought with gratitudethat he should have a night of good sleep. The sea of faces rolling up tohim under the lights filled him with peace. "There is so much of life," hethought, "it must come to some end."</p><p> Looking intently at the faces, the dull faces and the bright faces, thefaces drawn out of shape and with eyes nearly meeting above the nose, thefaces with long, heavy sensual jaws, and the empty, soft faces on whichthe scalding finger of thought had left no mark, his fingers ached to geta pencil in his hand, or to spread the faces upon canvas in enduringpigments, to hold them up before the world and to be able to say, "Hereare the faces you, by your lives, have made for yourselves and for yourchildren."</p><p> In the lobby of a tall office building, where he stopped at a little cigarcounter to get fresh tobacco for his pipe, he looked so fixedly at a womanclad in long soft furs, that in alarm she hurried out to her machine towait for her escort, who had evidently gone up the elevator.</p><p> Once more in the street, Sam shuddered at the thought of the hands thathad laboured that the soft cheeks and the untroubled eyes of this onewoman might be. Into his mind came the face and figure of a littleCanadian nurse who had once cared for him through an illness--her quick,deft fingers and her muscular little arms. "Another such as she," hemuttered, "has been at work upon the face and body of this gentlewoman; ahunter has gone into the white silence of the north to bring out the warmfurs that adorn her; for her there has been a tragedy--a shot, and redblood upon the snow, and a struggling beast waving its little claws in theair; for her a woman has worked through the morning, bathing her whitelimbs, her cheeks, her hair."</p><p> For this gentlewoman also there had been a man apportioned, a man likehimself, who had cheated and lied and gone through the years in pursuit ofthe dollars to pay all of the others, a man of power, a man who couldachieve, could accomplish. Again he felt within him a yearning for thepower of the artist, the power not only to see the meaning of the faces inthe street, but to reproduce what he saw, to get with subtle fingers thestory of the achievement of mankind into a face hanging upon a wall.</p><p> In other days, in Caxton, listening to Telfer's talk, and in Chicago andNew York with Sue, Sam had tried to get an inkling of the passion of theartist; now walking and looking at the faces rolling past him on the longstreet he thought that he did understand.</p><p> Once when he was new in the city he had, for some months, carried on anaffair with a woman, the daughter of a cattle farmer from Iowa. Now herface filled his vision. How rugged it was, how filled with the message ofthe ground underfoot; the thick lips, the dull eyes, the strong, bulletlike head, how like the cattle her father had bought and sold. Heremembered the little room in Chicago where he had his first love passagewith this woman. How frank and wholesome it had seemed. How eagerly bothman and woman had rushed at evening to the meeting place. How her stronghands had clasped him. The face of the woman in the motor by the officebuilding danced before his eyes, the face so peaceful, so free from themarks of human passion, and he wondered what daughter of a cattle raiserhad taken the passion out of the man who paid for the beauty of that face.</p><p> On a side street, near the lighted front of a cheap theatre, a woman,standing alone and half concealed in the doorway of a church, calledsoftly, and turning he went to her.</p><p> "I am not a customer," he said, looking at her thin face and bony hands,"but if you care to come with me I will stand a good dinner. I am gettinghungry and do not like eating alone. I want some one to talk to me so thatI won't get to thinking."</p><p> "You're a queer bird," said the woman, taking his arm. "What have you donethat you don't want to think?"</p><p> Sam said nothing.</p><p> "There's a place over there," she said, pointing to the lighted front of acheap restaurant with soiled curtains at the windows.</p><p> Sam kept on walking.</p><p> "If you do not mind," he said, "I will pick the place. I want to buy agood dinner. I want a place with clean linen on the table and a good cookin the kitchen."</p><p> They stopped at a corner to talk of the dinner, and at her suggestion hewaited at a near-by drug store while she went to her room. As he waited hewent to the telephone and ordered the dinner and a taxicab. When shereturned she had on a clean shirtwaist and had combed her hair. Samthought he caught the odour of benzine, and guessed she had been at workon the spots on her worn jacket. She seemed surprised to find him stillwaiting.</p><p> "I thought maybe it was a stall," she said.</p><p> They drove in silence to a place Sam had in mind, a road-house with cleanwashed floors, painted walls, and open fires in the private dining-rooms.Sam had been there several times during the month, and the food had beenwell cooked.</p><p> They ate in silence. Sam had no curiosity to hear her talk of herself, andshe seemed to have no knack of casual conversation. He was not studyingher, but had brought her as he had said, because of his loneliness, andbecause her thin, tired face and frail body, looking out from the darknessby the church door, had made an appeal.</p><p> She had, he thought, a look of hard chastity, like one whipped but notdefeated. Her cheeks were thin and covered with freckles, like a boy's.Her teeth were broken and in bad repair, though clean, and her hands hadthe worn, hardly-used look of his own mother's hands. Now that she satbefore him in the restaurant, in some vague way she resembled his mother.</p><p> After dinner he sat smoking his cigar and looking at the fire. The womanof the streets leaned across the table and touched him on the arm.</p><p> "Are you going to take me anywhere after this--after we leave here?" shesaid.</p><p> "I am going to take you to the door of your room, that's all."</p><p> "I'm glad," she said; "it's a long time since I've had an evening likethis. It makes me feel clean."</p><p> For a time they sat in silence and then Sam began talking of his home townin Iowa, letting himself go and expressing the thoughts that came into hismind. He told her of his mother and of Mary Underwood and she in turn toldof her town and of her life. She had some difficulty about hearing whichmade conversation trying. Words and sentences had to be repeated to herand after a time Sam smoked and looked at the fire, letting her talk. Herfather had been a captain of a small steamboat plying up and down LongIsland Sound and her mother a careful, shrewd woman and a goodhousekeeper. They had lived in a Rhode Island village and had a gardenback of their house. The captain had not married until he was forty-fiveand had died when the girl was eighteen, the mother dying a year later.</p><p> The girl had not been much known in the Rhode Island village, being shyand reticent. She had kept the house clean and helped the captain in thegarden. When her parents were dead she had found herself alone withthirty-seven hundred dollars in the bank and the little home, and hadmarried a young man who was a clerk in a railroad office, and sold thehouse to move to Kansas City. The big flat country frightened her. Herlife there had been unsuccessful. She had been lonely for the hills andthe water of her New England village, and she was, by nature,undemonstrative and unemotional, so that she did not get much hold of herhusband. He had undoubtedly married her for the little hoard and, byvarious devices, began getting it from her. A son had been born, for atime her health broke badly, and she discovered through an accident thather husband was spending her money in dissipation among the women of thetown.</p><p> "There wasn't any use wasting words when I found he didn't care for me orfor the baby and wouldn't support us, so I left him," she said in a level,businesslike way.</p><p> When she came to count up, after she had got clear of her husband and hadtaken a course in stenography, there was one thousand dollars of hersavings left and she felt pretty safe. She took a position and went towork, feeling well satisfied and happy. And then came the trouble with herhearing. She began to lose places and finally had to be content with asmall salary, earned by copying form letters for a mail order medicineman. The boy she put out with a capable German woman, the wife of agardener. She paid four dollars a week for him and there was clothing tobe bought for herself and the boy. Her wage from the medicine man wasseven dollars a week.</p><p> "And so," she said, "I began going on the street. I knew no one and therewas nothing else to do. I couldn't do that in the town where the boylived, so I came away. I've gone from city to city, working mostly forpatent medicine men and filling out my income by what I earned in thestreets. I'm not naturally a woman who cares about men and not many ofthem care about me. I don't like to have them touch me with their hands. Ican't drink as most of the girls do; it sickens me. I want to be leftalone. Perhaps I shouldn't have married. Not that I minded my husband. Wegot along very well until I had to stop giving him money. When I foundwhere it was going it opened my eyes. I felt that I had to have at least athousand dollars for the boy in case anything happened to me. When I foundthere wasn't anything to do but just go on the streets, I went. I trieddoing other work, but hadn't the strength, and when it came to the test Icared more about the boy than I did about myself--any woman would. Ithought he was of more importance than what I wanted.</p><p> "It hasn't been easy for me. Sometimes when I have got a man to go with meI walk along the street praying that I won't shudder and draw away when hetouches me with his hands. I know that if I do he will go away and I won'tget any money.</p><p> "And then they talk and lie about themselves. I've had them try to workoff bad money and worthless jewelry on me. Sometimes they try to make loveto me and then steal back the money they have given me. That's the hardpart, the lying and the pretence. All day I write the same lies over andover for the patent-medicine men and then at night I listen to theseothers lying to me."</p><p> She stopped talking and leaning over put her cheek down on her hand andsat looking into the fire.</p><p> "My mother," she began again, "didn't always wear a clean dress. Shecouldn't. She was always down on her knees scrubbing around the floor orout in the garden pulling weeds. But she hated dirt. If her dress wasdirty her underwear was clean and so was her body. She taught me to bethat way and I wanted to be. It came naturally. But I'm losing it all. Allevening I have been sitting here with you thinking that my underwear isn'tclean. Most of the time I don't care. Being clean doesn't go with what Iam doing. I have to keep trying to be flashy outside so that men will stopwhen they see me on the street. Sometimes when I have done well I don't goon the streets for three or four weeks. Then I clean up my room and bathemyself. My landlady lets me do my washing in the basement at night. Idon't seem to care about cleanliness the weeks I am on the streets."</p><p> The little German orchestra began playing a lullaby, and a fat Germanwaiter came in at the open door and put more wood on the fire. He stoppedby the table and talked about the mud in the road outside. From anotherroom came the silvery clink of glasses and the sound of laughing voices.The girl and Sam drifted back into talk of their home towns. Sam felt thathe liked her very much and thought that if she had belonged to him heshould have found a basis on which to live with her contentedly. She had aquality of honesty that he was always seeking in people.</p><p> As they drove back to the city she put a hand on his arm.</p><p> "I wouldn't mind about you," she said, looking at him frankly.</p><p> Sam laughed and patted her thin hand. "It's been a good evening," he said,"we'll go through with it as it stands."</p><p> "Thanks for that," she said, "and there is something else I want to tellyou. Perhaps you will think it bad of me. Sometimes when I don't want togo on the streets I get down on my knees and pray for strength to go ongamely. Does it seem bad? We are a praying people, we New Englanders."</p><p> As he stood in the street Sam could hear her laboured asthmatic breathingas she climbed the stairs to her room. Half way up she stopped and wavedher hand at him. The thing was awkwardly done and boyish. Sam had afeeling that he should like to get a gun and begin shooting citizens inthe streets. He stood in the lighted city looking down the long desertedstreet and thought of Mike McCarthy in the jail at Caxton. Like Mike, helifted up his voice in the night.</p><p> "Are you there, O God? Have you left your children here on the earthhurting each other? Do you put the seed of a million children in a man,and the planting of a forest in one tree, and permit men to wreck and hurtand destroy?"</p><h2>Book III - Chapter 6</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> One morning, at the end of his second year of wandering, Sam got out ofhis bed in a cold little hotel in a mining village in West Virginia,looked at the miners, their lamps in their caps, going through the dimlylighted streets, ate a portion of leathery breakfast cakes, paid his billat the hotel, and took a train for New York. He had definitely abandonedthe idea of getting at what he wanted through wandering about the countryand talking to chance acquaintances by the wayside and in villages, andhad decided to return to a way of life more befitting his income.</p><p> He felt that he was not by nature a vagabond, and that the call of thewind and the sun and the brown road was not insistent in his blood. Thespirit of Pan did not command him, and although there were certain springmornings of his wandering days that were like mountain tops in hisexperience of life, mornings when some strong, sweet feeling ran throughthe trees, and the grass, and the body of the wanderer, and when the callof life seemed to come shouting and inviting down the wind, filling himwith delight of the blood in his body and the thoughts in his brain, yetat bottom and in spite of these days of pure joy he was, after all, a manof the towns and the crowds. Caxton and South Water Street and LaSalleStreet had all left their marks on him, and so, throwing his canvas jacketinto a corner of the room in the West Virginia hotel, he returned to thehaunts of his kind.</p><p> In New York he went to an uptown club where he owned a membership and intothe grill where he found at breakfast an actor acquaintance named Jackson.</p><p> Sam dropped into a chair and looked about him. He remembered a visit hehad made there some years before with Webster and Crofts and felt againthe quiet elegance of the surroundings.</p><p> "Hello, Moneymaker," said Jackson, heartily. "Heard you had gone to anunnery."</p><p> Sam laughed and began ordering a breakfast that made Jackson's eyes openwith astonishment.</p><p> "You, Mr. Elegance, would not understand a man's spending month aftermonth in the open air seeking a good body and an end in life and thensuddenly changing his mind and coming back to a place like this," heobserved.</p><p> Jackson laughed and lighted a cigarette.</p><p> "How little you know me," he said. "I would live my life in the open butthat I am a mighty good actor and have just finished another long New Yorkrun. What are you going to do now that you are thin and brown? Will you goback to Morrison and Prince and money making?"</p><p> Sam shook his head and looked at the quiet elegance of the man before him.How satisfied and happy he looked.</p><p> "I am going to try living among the rich and the leisurely," he said.</p><p> "They are a rotten crew," Jackson assured him, "and I am taking a nighttrain for Detroit. Come with me. We will talk things over."</p><p> On the train that night they got into talk with a broad-shouldered old manwho told them of a hunting trip on which he was bound.</p><p> "I am going to sail from Seattle," he said, "and go everywhere and hunteverything. I am going to shoot the head off of every big animal kind ofthing left in the world and then come back to New York and stay thereuntil I die."</p><p> "I will go with you," said Sam, and in the morning left Jackson at Detroitand continued westward with his new acquaintance.</p><p> For months Sam travelled and shot with the old man, a vigorous, bighearted old fellow who, having become wealthy through an early investmentin stock of the Standard Oil Company, devoted his life to his lusty,primitive passion for shooting and killing. They went on lion hunts,elephant hunts and tiger hunts, and when on the west coast of Africa Samtook a boat for London, his companion walked up and down the beach smokingblack cheroots and declaring the fun was only half over and that Sam was afool to go.</p><p> After the year of the hunt royal Sam spent another year living the life ofa gentleman of wealth and leisure in London, New York, and Paris. He wenton automobile trips, fished and loafed along the shores of northern lakes,canoed through Canada with a writer of nature books, and sat about clubsand fashionable hotels listening to the talk of the men and women of thatworld.</p><p> Late one afternoon in the spring of the year he went to the village on theHudson River where Sue had taken a house, and almost immediately saw her.For an hour he followed, watching her quick, active little figure as shewalked through the village streets, and wondering what life had come tomean to her, but when, turning suddenly, she would have come face to facewith him, he hurried down a side street and took a train to the cityfeeling that he could not face her empty-handed and ashamed after theyears.</p><p> In the end he started drinking again, not moderately now, but steadily andalmost continuously. One night in Detroit, with three young men from hishotel, he got drunk and was, for the first time since his parting withSue, in the company of women. Four of them, met in some restaurant, gotinto an automobile with Sam and the three young men and rode about townlaughing, waving bottles of wine in the air, and calling to passers-by inthe street. They wound up in a diningroom in a place at the edge of town,where the party spent hours around a long table, drinking, and singingsongs.</p><p> One of the girls sat on Sam's lap and put an arm about his neck.</p><p> "Give me some money, rich man," she said.</p><p> Sam looked at her closely.</p><p> "Who are you?" he asked.</p><p> She began explaining that she was a clerk in a downtown store and that shehad a lover who drove a laundry wagon.</p><p> "I go on these bats to get money to buy good clothes," she said frankly,"but if Tim saw me here he would kill me."</p><p> Putting a bill into her hand Sam went downstairs and getting into ataxicab drove back to his hotel.</p><p> After that night he went frequently on carouses of this kind. He was in akind of prolonged stupor of inaction, talked of trips abroad which he didnot take, bought a huge farm in Virginia which he never visited, planned areturn to business which he did not execute, and month after monthcontinued to waste his days. He would get out of bed at noon and begindrinking steadily. As the afternoon passed he grew merry and talkative,calling men by their first names, slapping chance acquaintances on theback, playing pool or billiards with skilful young men intent upon gain.In the early summer he got in with a party of young men from New York andwith them spent months in sheer idle waste of time. Together they drovehigh-powered automobiles on long trips, drank, quarrelled, and went onboard a yacht to carouse, alone or with women. At times Sam would leavehis companions and spend days riding through the country on fast trains,sitting for hours in silence looking out of the window at the passingcountry and wondering at his endurance of the life he led. For some monthshe carried with him a young man whom he called a secretary and paid alarge salary for his ability to tell stories and sing clever songs, onlyto discharge him suddenly for telling a foul tale that reminded Sam ofanother tale told by the stoop-shouldered old man in the office of Ed'shotel in the Illinois town.</p><p> From being silent and taciturn, as during the months of his wanderings,Sam became morose and combative. Staying on and on in the empty, aimlessway of life he had adopted he yet felt that there was for him a right wayof living and wondered at his continued inability to find it. He lost hisnative energy, grew fat and coarse of body, was pleased for hours bylittle things, read no books, lay for hours in bed drunk and talkingnonsense to himself, ran about the streets swearing vilely, grewhabitually coarse in thought and speech, sought constantly a lower andmore vulgar set of companions, was brutal and ugly with attendants abouthotels and clubs where he lived, hated life, but ran like a coward tosanitariums and health resorts at the wagging of a doctor's head.</p><h2>Book IV - Chapter 1</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> One afternoon in early September Sam got on a westward-bound trainintending to visit his sister on the farm near Caxton. For years he hadheard nothing from Kate, but she had, he knew, two daughters, and hethought he would do something for them.</p><p> "I will put them on the Virginia farm and make a will leaving them mymoney," he thought. "Perhaps I shall be able to make them happy by settingthem up in life and giving them beautiful clothes to wear."</p><p> At St. Louis he got off the train, thinking vaguely that he would see anattorney and make arrangements about the will, and for several days stayedabout the Planters Hotel with a set of drinking companions he had pickedup. One afternoon he began going from place to place drinking andgathering companions. An ugly light was in his eyes and he looked at menand women passing in the streets, feeling that he was in the midst ofenemies, and that for him the peace, contentment, and good cheer thatshone out of the eyes of others was beyond getting.</p><p> In the late afternoon, followed by a troop of roistering companions, hecame out upon a street flanked with small, brick warehouses facing theriver, where steamboats lay tied to floating docks.</p><p> "I want a boat to take me and my crowd for a cruise up and down theriver," he announced, approaching the captain of one of the boats. "Takeus up and down the river until we are tired of it. I will pay what itcosts."</p><p> It was one of the days when drink would not take hold of him, and he wentamong his companions, buying drinks and thinking himself a fool tocontinue furnishing entertainment for the vile crew that sat about him onthe deck of the boat. He began shouting and ordering them about.</p><p> "Sing louder," he commanded, tramping up and down and scowling at hiscompanions.</p><p> A young man of the party who had a reputation as a dancer refused toperform when commanded. Springing forward Sam dragged him out on the deckbefore the shouting crowd.</p><p> "Now dance!" he growled, "or I will throw you into the river."</p><p> The young man danced furiously, and Sam marched up and down and looked athim and at the leering faces of the men and women lounging along the deckor shouting at the dancer. The liquor in him beginning to take effect, aqueerly distorted version of his old passion for reproduction came to himand he raised his hand for silence.</p><p> "I want to see a woman who is a mother," he shouted. "I want to see awoman who has borne children."</p><p> A small woman with black hair and burning black eyes sprang from the groupgathered about the dancer.</p><p> "I have borne children--three of them," she said, laughing up into hisface. "I can bear more of them."</p><p> Sam looked at her stupidly and taking her by the arm led her to a chair onthe deck. The crowd laughed.</p><p> "Belle is after his roll," whispered a short, fat man to his companion, atall woman with blue eyes.</p><p> As the steamer, with its load of men and women drinking and singing songs,went up the river past bluffs covered with trees, the woman beside Sampointed to a row of tiny houses at the top of the bluffs.</p><p> "My children are there. They are getting supper now," she said.</p><p> She began singing, laughing and waving a bottle to the others sittingalong the deck. A youth with heavy features stood upon a chair and sang asong of the street, and, jumping to her feet, Sam's companion kept timewith the bottle in her hand. Sam walked over to where the captain stoodlooking up the river.</p><p> "Turn back," he said, "I am tired of this crew."</p><p> On the way back down the river the black-eyed woman again sat beside Sam.</p><p> "We will go to my house," she said quietly, "just you and me. I will showyou the kids."</p><p> Darkness was gathering over the river as the boat turned, and in thedistance the lights of the city began blinking into view. The crowd hadgrown quiet, sleeping in chairs along the deck or gathering in smallgroups and talking in low tones. The black-haired woman began to tell Samher story.</p><p> She was, she said, the wife of a plumber who had left her.</p><p> "I drove him crazy," she said, laughing quietly. "He wanted me to stay athome with him and the kids night after night. He used to follow me downtown at night begging me to come home. When I wouldn't come he would goaway with tears in his eyes. It made me furious. He wasn't a man. He woulddo anything I asked him to do. And then he ran away and left the kids onmy hands."</p><p> In the city Sam, with the black-haired woman beside him, rode about in anopen carriage, forgetting the children and going from place to place,eating and drinking. For an hour they sat in a box at the theatre, butgrew tired of the performance and climbed again into the carriage.</p><p> "We will go to my house. I want to have you alone," said the woman.</p><p> They drove through street after street of workingmen's houses, wherechildren ran laughing and playing under the lights, and two boys, theirbare legs flashing in the lights from the lamps overhead, ran after them,holding to the back of the carriage.</p><p> The driver whipped the horses and looked back laughing. The woman got upand kneeling on the seat of the carriage laughed down into the faces ofthe running boys.</p><p> "Run, you little devils," she cried.</p><p> They held on, running furiously. Their legs twinkled and flashed under thelights.</p><p> "Give me a silver dollar," she said, turning to Sam, and when he had givenit to her, threw it ringing upon the pavement under a street lamp. The twoboys darted for it, shouting and waving their hands to her.</p><p> Swarms of huge flies and beetles circled under the street lamps, strikingSam and the woman in the face. One of them, a great black crawling thing,alighted on her breast, and taking it in her hand she crept forward anddropped it down the neck of the driver.</p><p> In spite of his hard drinking during the afternoon and evening, Sam's headwas clear and a calm hatred of life burned in him. His mind ran back overthe years he had passed since breaking his word to Sue, and a scorn of alleffort burned in him.</p><p> "It is what a man gets who goes seeking Truth," he thought. "He comes to afine end in life."</p><p> On all sides of him life ran playing on the pavement and leaping in theair. It circled and buzzed and sang above his head in the summer nightthere in the heart of the city. Even in the sullen man sitting in thecarriage beside the black-haired woman it began to sing. The blood climbedthrough his body; an old half-dead longing, half hunger, half hope awokein him, pulsating and insistent. He looked at the laughing, intoxicatedwoman beside him and a feeling of masculine approval shot through him. Hebegan thinking of what she had said before the laughing crowd on thesteamer.</p><p> "I have borne three children and can bear more."</p><p> His blood, stirred by the sight of the woman, awoke his sleeping brain,and he began again to quarrel with life and what life had offered him. Hethought that always he would stubbornly refuse to accept the call of lifeunless he could have it on his own terms, unless he could command anddirect it as he had commanded and directed the gun company.</p><p> "Else why am I here?" he muttered, looking away from the vacant, laughingface of the woman and at the broad, muscular back of the driver on theseat in front. "Why had I a brain and a dream and a hope? Why went I aboutseeking Truth?"</p><p> His mind ran on in the vein started by the sight of the circling beetlesand the running boys. The woman put her head upon his shoulder and herblack hair blew against his face. She struck wildly at the circlingbeetles, laughing like a child when she had caught one of them in herhand.</p><p> "Men like me are for some end. They are not to be played with as I havebeen," he muttered, clinging to the hand of the woman, who, also, hethought, was being tossed about by life.</p><p> Before a saloon, on a street where cars ran, the carriage stopped. Throughthe open front door Sam could see working-men standing before a bardrinking foaming glasses of beer, the hanging lamps above their headsthrowing their black shadows upon the floor. A strong, stale smell cameout at the door. The woman leaned over the side of the carriage andshouted. "O Will, come out here."</p><p> A man clad in a long white apron and with his shirt sleeves rolled to hiselbows came from behind the bar and talked to her, and when they hadstarted on she told Sam of her plan to sell her home and buy the place.</p><p> "Will you run it?" he asked.</p><p> "Sure," she said. "The kids can take care of themselves."</p><p> At the end of a little street of a half dozen neat cottages, they got outof the carriage and walked with uncertain steps along a sidewalk skirtinga high bluff and overlooking the river. Below the houses a tangled mass ofbushes and small trees lay black in the moonlight, and in the distance thegrey body of the river showed faint and far away. The undergrowth was sothick that, looking down, one saw only the tops of the growth, with hereand there a grey outcrop of rocks that glistened in the moonlight.</p><p> Up a flight of stone steps they climbed to the porch of one of the housesfacing the river. The woman had stopped laughing and hung heavily on Sam'sarm, her feet groping for the steps. They passed through a door and into along, low-ceilinged room. An open stairway at the side of the room went upto the floor above, and through a curtained doorway at the end one lookedinto a small dining-room. A rag carpet lay on the floor and about a table, under a hanging lamp at the centre, sat threechildren. Sam looked at them closely. His head reeled and he clutched atthe knob of the door. A boy of perhaps fourteen, with freckles on his faceand on the backs of his hands and with reddish-brown hair and brown eyes,was reading aloud. Beside him a younger boy with black hair and blackeyes, and with his knees doubled up on the chair in front of him so thathis chin rested on them, sat listening. A tiny girl, pale and with yellowhair and dark circles under her eyes, slept in another chair, her headhanging uncomfortably to one side. She was, one would have said, seven,the black-haired boy ten.</p><p> The freckle-faced boy stopped reading and looked at the man and woman; thesleeping child stirred uneasily in her chair, and the black-haired boystraightened out his legs and looked over his shoulder.</p><p> "Hello, Mother," he said heartily.</p><p> The woman walked unsteadily to the curtained doorway leading into thedining-room and pulled aside the curtains.</p><p> "Come here, Joe," she said.</p><p> The freckle-faced boy arose and went toward her. She stood aside,supporting herself with one hand grasping the curtain. As he passed shestruck him with her open hand on the back of the head, sending him reelinginto the dining-room.</p><p> "Now you, Tom," she called to the black-haired boy. "I told you kids towash the dishes after supper and to put Mary to bed. Here it is past tenand nothing done and you two reading books again."</p><p> The black-haired boy got up and started obediently toward her, but Samwalked rapidly past him and clutched the woman by the arm so that shewinced and twisted in his grasp.</p><p> "You come with me," he said.</p><p> He walked the woman across the room and up the stairs. She leaned heavilyon his arm, laughing, and looking up into his face.</p><p> At the top of the stairway he stopped.</p><p> "We go in here," she said, pointing to a door.</p><p> He took her into the room. "You get to sleep," he said, and going outclosed the door, leaving her sitting heavily on the edge of the bed.</p><p> Downstairs he found the two boys among the dishes in a tiny kitchen offthe dining-room. The little girl still slept uneasily in the chair by thetable, the hot lamp-light streaming down on her thin cheeks.</p><p> Sam stood in the kitchen door looking at the two boys, who looked back athim self-consciously.</p><p> "Which of you two puts Mary to bed?" he asked, and then, without waitingfor an answer, turned to the taller of the two boys. "Let Tom do it," hesaid. "I will help you here."</p><p> Joe and Sam stood in the kitchen at work with the dishes; the boy, goingbusily about, showed the man where to put the clean dishes, and got himdry wiping towels. Sam's coat was off and his sleeves rolled up.</p><p> The work went on in half awkward silence and a storm went on within Sam'sbreast. When the boy Joe looked shyly up at him it was as though the lashof a whip had cut down across flesh, suddenly grown tender. Old memoriesbegan to stir within him and he remembered his own childhood, his motherat work among other people's soiled clothes, his father Windy coming homedrunk, and the chill in his mother's heart and in his own. There wassomething men and women owed to childhood, not because it was childhoodbut because it was new life springing up. Aside from any question offatherhood or motherhood there was a debt to be paid.</p><p> In the little house on the bluff there was silence. Outside the housethere was darkness and darkness lay over Sam's spirit. The boy Joe wentquickly about, putting the dishes Sam had wiped on the shelves. Somewhereon the river, far below the house, a steamboat whistled. The backs of thehands of the boy were covered with freckles. How quick and competent thehands were. Here was new life, as yet clean, unsoiled, unshaken by life.Sam was shamed by the trembling of his own hands. He had always wantedquickness and firmness within his own body, the health of the body that isa temple for the health of the spirit. He was an American and down deepwithin himself was the moral fervor that is American and that had becomeso strangely perverted in himself and others. As so often happened withhim, when he was deeply stirred, an army of vagrant thoughts ran throughhis head. The thoughts had taken the place of the perpetual scheming andplanning of his days as a man of affairs, but as yet all his thinking hadbrought him to nothing and had only left him more shaken and uncertainthen ever.</p><p> The dishes were now all wiped and he went out of the kitchen glad toescape the shy silent presence of the boy. "Has life quite gone from me?Am I but a dead thing walking about?" he asked himself. The presence ofthe children had made him feel that he was himself but a child, a growntired and shaken child. There was maturity and manhood somewhere abroad.Why could he not come to it? Why could it not come into him?</p><p> The boy Tom returned from having put his sister into bed and the two boyssaid good night to the strange man in their mother's house. Joe, thebolder of the two, stepped forward and offered his hand. Sam shook itsolemnly and then the younger boy came forward.</p><p> "I'll be around here to-morrow I think," Sam said huskily.</p><p> The boys were gone, into the silence of the house, and Sam walked up anddown in the little room. He was restless as though about to start on a newjourney and half unconsciously began running his hands over his bodywishing it strong and hard as when he tramped the road. As on the day whenhe had walked out of the Chicago Club bound on his hunt for Truth, he lethis mind go so that it played freely over his past life, reviewing andanalysing.</p><p> For hours he sat on the porch or walked up and down in the room where thelamp still burned brightly. Again the smoke from his pipe tasted good onhis tongue and all the night air had a sweetness that brought back to himthe walk beside the bridle path in Jackson Park when Sue had given himherself, and with herself a new impulse in life.</p><p> It was two o'clock when he lay down upon a couch in the living-room andblew out the light. He did not undress, but threw his shoes on the floorand lay looking at a wide path of moonlight that came through the opendoor. In the darkness it seemed that his mind worked more rapidly and thatthe events and motives of his restless years went streaming past likeliving things upon the floor.</p><p> Suddenly he sat up and listened. The voice of one of the boys, heavy withsleep, ran through the upper part of the house.</p><p> "Mother! O Mother!" called the sleepy voice, and Sam thought he could hearthe little body moving restlessly in bed.</p><p> Silence followed. He sat upon the edge of the couch, waiting. It seemed tohim that he was coming to something; that his brain that had for hoursbeen working more and more rapidly was about to produce the thing forwhich he waited. He felt as he had felt that night as he waited in thecorridor of the hospital.</p><p> In the morning the three children came down the stairs and finisheddressing in the long room, the little girl coming last, carrying her shoesand stockings and rubbing her eyes with the back of her hand. A coolmorning wind blew up from the river and through the open screened doors ashe and Joe cooked breakfast, and later as the four of them sat at thetable Sam tried to talk but did not make much progress. His tongue washeavy and the children seemed looking at him with strange questioningeyes. "Why are you here?" their eyes asked.</p><p> For a week Sam stayed in the city, coming daily to the house. With thechildren he talked a little, and in the evening, when the mother had goneaway, the little girl came to him. He carried her to a chair on the porchoutside and while the boys sat reading under the lamp inside she went tosleep in his arms. Her body was warm and the breath came softly andsweetly from between her lips. Sam looked down the bluffside and saw thecountry and the river far below, sweet in the moonlight. Tears came intohis eyes. Was a new sweet purpose growing within him or were the tears butevidence of self pity? He wondered.</p><p> One night the black-haired woman again came home far gone in drink, andagain Sam led her up the stairs to see her fall muttering and babblingupon the bed. Her companion, a little flashily dressed man with a beard,had run off at the sight of Sam standing in the living-room under thelamp. The two boys, to whom he had been reading, said nothing, lookingself-consciously at the book upon the table and occasionally out of thecorner of their eyes at their new friend. In a few minutes they too wentup the stairs, and as on that first night, they put out their handsawkwardly.</p><p> Through the night Sam again sat in the darkness outside or lay awake onthe couch. "I will make a new try, adopt a new purpose in life now," hesaid to himself.</p><p> When the children had gone to school the next morning, Sam took a car andwent into the city, going first to a bank to have a large draft cashed.Then he spent many busy hours going from store to store and buyingclothes, caps, soft underwear, suit cases, dresses, night clothes, andbooks. Last of all he bought a large dressed doll. All these things he hadsent to his room at the hotel, leaving a man there to pack the trunks andsuit cases, and get them to the station. A large, motherly-looking woman,an employ of the hotel, who passed through the hall, offered to help withthe packing.</p><p> After another visit or two Sam got back upon the car and went again to thehouse. In his pockets he had several thousands of dollars in large bills.He had remembered the power of cash in deals he had made in the past.</p><p> "I will see what it will do here," he thought.</p><p> In the house Sam found the black-haired woman lying on a couch in theliving-room. As he came in at the door she arose unsteadily and looked athim.</p><p> "There's a bottle in the cupboard in the kitchen," she said. "Get me adrink. Why do you hang about here?"</p><p> Sam brought the bottle and poured her a drink, pretending to drink withher by putting the bottle to his lips and throwing back his head.</p><p> "What was your husband like?" he asked.</p><p> "Who? Jack?" she said. "Oh, he was all right. He was stuck on me. He stoodfor anything until I brought men home here. Then he got crazy and wentaway." She looked at Sam and laughed.</p><p> "I didn't care much for him," she added. "He couldn't make money enoughfor a live woman."</p><p> Sam began talking of the saloon she intended buying.</p><p> "The children will be a bother, eh?" he said.</p><p> "I have an offer for the house," she said. "I wish I didn't have the kids.They are a nuisance."</p><p> "I have been figuring that out," Sam told her. "I know a woman in the Eastwho would take them and raise them. She is wild about kids. I should liketo do something to help you. I might take them to her."</p><p> "In the name of Heaven, man, lead them away," she laughed, and tookanother drink from the bottle.</p><p> Sam drew from his pocket a paper he had secured from a downtown attorney.</p><p> "Get a neighbour in here to witness this," he said. "The woman will wantthings regular. It releases you from all responsibility for the kids andputs it on her."</p><p> She looked at him suspiciously. "What's the graft? Who gets stuck for thefares down east?"</p><p> Sam laughed and going to the back door shouted to a man who sat under atree back of the next house smoking a pipe.</p><p> "Sign here," he said, putting the paper before her. "Here is yourneighbour to sign as witness. You do not get stuck for a cent."</p><p> The woman, half drunk, signed the paper, after a long doubtful look atSam, and when she had signed and had taken another drink from the bottlelay down again on the couch.</p><p> "If any one wakes me up for the next six hours they will get killed," shedeclared. It was evident she knew little of what she had done, but at themoment Sam did not care. He was again a bargainer, ready to take anadvantage. Vaguely he felt that he might be bargaining for an end in life,for purpose to come into his own life.</p><p> Sam went quietly down the stone steps and along the little street at thebrow of the hill to the car tracks, and at noon was waiting in anautomobile outside the door of the schoolhouse when the children came out.</p><p> He drove across the city to the Union Station, the three childrenaccepting him and all he did without question. At the station they foundthe man from the hotel with the trunks and with three bright new suitcases. Sam went to the express office and putting several bills into anenvelope sealed and sent it to the woman while the three children walkedup and down in the train shed carrying the cases, aglow with the pride ofthem.</p><p> At two o'clock Sam, with the little girl in his arms and with one of theboys seated on either side of him, sat in a stateroom of a New York flyer--bound for Sue.</p><h2>Book IV - Chapter 2</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sam McPherson is a living American. He is a rich man, but his money, thathe spent so many years and so much of his energy acquiring, does not meanmuch to him. What is true of him is true of more wealthy Americans than iscommonly believed. Something has happened to him that has happened to theothers also, to how many of the others? Men of courage, with strong bodiesand quick brains, men who have come of a strong race, have taken up whatthey had thought to be the banner of life and carried it forward. Growingweary they have stopped in a road that climbs a long hill and have leanedthe banner against a tree. Tight brains have loosened a little. Strongconvictions have become weak. Old gods are dying.</p><p> "It is only when you are torn from your mooring and drift like a rudderless ship I am able to come near to you."</p><p> The banner has been carried forward by a strong daring man filled withdetermination.</p><p> What is inscribed on it?</p><p> It would perhaps be dangerous to inquire too closely. We Americans havebelieved that life must have point and purpose. We have called ourselvesChristians, but the sweet Christian philosophy of failure has been unknownamong us. To say of one of us that he has failed is to take life andcourage away. For so long we have had to push blindly forward. Roads hadto be cut through our forests, great towns must be built. What in Europehas been slowly building itself out of the fibre of the generations wemust build now, in a lifetime.</p><p> In our father's day, at night in the forests of Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky,and on the wide prairies, wolves howled. There was fear in our fathers andmothers, pushing their way forward, making the new land. When the land wasconquered fear remained, the fear of failure. Deep in our American soulsthe wolves still howl.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> There were moments after Sam came back to Sue, bringing the threechildren, when he thought he had snatched success out of the very jaws offailure.</p><p> But the thing from which he had all his life been fleeing was still there.It hid itself in the branches of the trees that lined the New Englandroads where he went to walk with the two boys. At night it looked down athim from the stars.</p><p> Perhaps life wanted acceptance from him, but he could not accept. Perhapshis story and his life ended with the home-coming, perhaps it began then.</p><p> The home-coming was not in itself a completely happy event. There was ahouse with a fire at night and the voices of the children. In Sam's breastthere was a feeling of something alive, growing.</p><p> Sue was generous, but she was not now the Sue of the bridle path inJackson Park in Chicago or the Sue who had tried to remake the world byraising fallen women. On his arrival at her house, on a summer night,coming in suddenly and strangely with the three strange children--a littleinclined toward tears and homesickness--she was flustered and nervous.</p><p> Darkness was coming on when he walked up the gravel path from the gate tothe house door with the child Mary in his arms and the two boys, Joe andTom, walking soberly and solemnly beside him. Sue had just come out at thefront door and stood regarding them, startled and a little frightened. Herhair was becoming grey, but as she stood there Sam thought her figurealmost boyish in its slenderness.</p><p> With quick generosity she threw aside the inclination in herself to askmany questions but there was the suggestion of a taunt in the question shedid ask.</p><p> "Have you decided to come back to me and is this your home-coming?" sheasked, stepping down into the path and looking not at Sam but at thechildren.</p><p> Sam did not answer at once, and little Mary began to cry. That was a help.</p><p> "They will all be wanting something to eat and a place to sleep," he said,as though coming back to a wife, long neglected, and bringing with himthree strange children were an everyday affair.</p><p> Although she was puzzled and afraid, Sue smiled and led the way into thehouse. Lamps were lighted and the five human beings, so abruptly broughttogether, stood looking at each other. The two boys clung to each otherand little Mary put her arms about Sam's neck and hid her face on hisshoulder. He unloosed her clutching hands and put her boldly into Sue'sarms. "She will be your mother now," he said defiantly, not looking atSue.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> The evening was got through, blunderingly by himself, Sam thought, andvery nobly by Sue.</p><p> There was the mother hunger still alive in her. He had shrewdly counted onthat. It blinded her eyes to other things and then a notion had come intoher head and there seemed the possibility of doing a peculiarly romanticact. Before that notion was destroyed, later in the evening, both Sam andthe children had been installed in the house.</p><p> A tall strong Negress came into the room, and Sue gave her instructionsregarding food for the children. "They will want bread and milk, and bedsmust be found for them," she said, and then, although her mind was stillfilled with the romantic notion that they were Sam's children by someother woman, she took her plunge. "This is Mr. McPherson, my husband, andthese are our three children," she announced to the puzzled and smilingservant.</p><p> They went into a low-ceilinged room whose windows looked into a garden. Inthe garden an old Negro with a sprinkling can was watering flowers. Alittle light yet remained. Both Sam and Sue were glad there was no more."Don't bring lamps, a candle will do," Sue said, and she went to standnear the door beside her husband. The three children were on the point ofbreaking forth into sobs, but the Negro woman with a quick intuitive senseof the situation began to chatter, striving to make the children feel athome. She awoke wonder and hope in the breasts of the boys. "There is abarn with horses and cows. To-morrow old Ben will show you everything,"she said, smiling at them.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> A thick grove of elm and maple trees stood between Sue's house and a roadthat went down a hill into a New England village, and while Sue and theNegro woman put the children to bed, Sam went there to wait. In the feeblelight the trunks of trees could be dimly seen, but the thick branchesoverhead made a wall between him and the sky. He went back into thedarkness of the grove and then returned toward the open space before thehouse.</p><p> He was nervous and distraught and two Sam McPhersons seemed struggling forpossession of his person.</p><p> There was the man he had been taught by the life about him to bring alwaysto the surface, the shrewd, capable man who got his own way, trampledpeople underfoot, went plunging forward, always he hoped forward, the manof achievement.</p><p> And then there was another personality, a quite different beingaltogether, buried away within him, long neglected, often forgotten, atimid, shy, destructive Sam who had never really breathed or lived orwalked before men.</p><p> What of him? The life Sam had led had not taken the shy destructive thingwithin into account. Still it was powerful. Had it not torn him out of hisplace in life, made of him a homeless wanderer? How many times it hadtried to speak its own word, take entire possession of him.</p><p> It was trying again now, and again and from old habit Sam fought againstit, thrusting it back into the dark inner caves of himself, back intodarkness.</p><p> He kept whispering to himself. Perhaps now the test of his life had come.There was a way to approach life and love. There was Sue. A basis for loveand understanding might be found with her. Later the impulse could becarried on and into the lives of the children he had found and brought toher.</p><p> A vision of himself as a truly humble man, kneeling before life, kneelingbefore the intricate wonder of life, came to him, but he was again afraid.When he saw Sue's figure, dressed in white, a dim, pale, flashing thing,coming down steps toward him, he wanted to run away, to hide himself inthe darkness.</p><p> And he wanted also to run toward her, to kneel at her feet, not becauseshe was Sue but because she was human and like himself filled with humanperplexities.</p><p> He did neither of the two things. The boy of Caxton was still alive withinhim. With a boyish lift of the head he went boldly to her. "Nothing butboldness will answer now," he kept saying to himself.</p><p> * * * * *</p><p> They walked in the gravel path before the house and he tried lamely totell his story, the story of his wanderings, of his seeking. When he cameto the tale of the finding of the children she stopped in the path andstood listening, pale and tense in the half light.</p><p> Then she threw back her head and laughed, nervously, half hysterically. "Ihave taken them and you, of course," she said, after he had stepped to herand had put his arm about her waist. "My life alone hasn't turned out tobe a very inspiring affair. I had made up my mind to take them and you, inthe house there. The two years you have been gone have seemed like an age.What a foolish mistake my mind has made. I thought they must be your ownchildren by some other woman, some woman you had found to take my place.It was an odd notion. Why, the older of the two must be nearly fourteen."</p><p> They went toward the house, the Negro woman having, at Sue's command,found food for Sam and respread the table, but at the door he stopped andexcusing himself stepped again into the darkness under the trees.</p><p> In the house lamps had been lighted and he could see Sue's figure goingthrough a room at the front of the house toward the dining-room. Presentlyshe returned and pulled the shades at the front windows. A place was beingprepared for him inside there, a shut-in place in which he was to livewhat was left of his life.</p><p> With the pulling of the shades darkness dropped down over the figure ofthe man standing just within the grove of trees and darkness dropped downover the inner man also. The struggle within him became more intense.</p><p> Could he surrender to others, live for others? There was the house darklyseen before him. It was a symbol. Within the house was the woman, Sue,ready and willing to begin the task of rebuilding their lives together.Upstairs in the house now were the three children, three children who mustbegin life as he had once done, who must listen to his voice, the voice ofSue and all the other voices they would hear speaking words in the world.They would grow up and thrust out into a world of people as he had done.</p><p> To what end?</p><p> There was an end. Sam believed that stoutly. "To shift the load to theshoulders of children is cowardice," he whispered to himself.</p><p> An almost overpowering desire to turn and run away from the house, fromSue who had so generously received him and from the three new lives intowhich he had thrust himself and in which in the future he would have to beconcerned, took hold of him. His body shook with the strength of it, buthe stood still under the trees. "I cannot run away from life. I must faceit. I must begin to try to understand these other lives, to love," he toldhimself. The buried inner thing in him thrust itself up.</p><p> How still the night had become. In the tree beneath which he stood a birdmoved on some slender branch and there was a faint rustling of leaves. Thedarkness before and behind was a wall through which he must in some waymanage to thrust himself into the light. With his hand before him, asthough trying to push aside some dark blinding mass, he moved out of thegrove and thus moving stumbled up the steps and into the house.</p><p> THE END</p><p> </p>

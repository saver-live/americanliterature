<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, wash thyself in Jordan, go, wash thee and be clean! 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, not for any Prophet will I plunge a toe therein!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the banks of curious Jordan are parcelled into sites,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commanded and embellished and patrolled by Israelites.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There rise her timeless capitals of Empires daily born,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose plinths are laid at midnight, and whose streets are packed at morn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here come hired youths and maids that feign to love or sin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tones like rusty razor-blades to tunes like smitten tin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here be merry murtherings, and steeds with fiery hooves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And furious hordes with guns and swords, and clamberings over rooves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And horrid tumblings down from Heaven, and flights with wheels and wings;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And always one weak virgin who is chased through all these things.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is mock of faith and truth, for children to behold;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every door of ancient dirt reopened to the old;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With every word that taints the speech, and show that weakens thought;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Israel watcheth over each, and, doth not watch for nought. . . .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Pharphar, but Abana, which Hermon launcheth down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They perish fighting desert-sands beyond Damascus-town.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet their pulse is of the snows, their strength is from on high,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if they cannot cure my woes, a leper will I die!

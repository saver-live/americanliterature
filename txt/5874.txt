<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor be to Mudjekeewis!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried the warriors, cried the old men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came in triumph homeward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sacred Belt of Wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the regions of the North-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the kingdom of Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the White Rabbit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had stolen the Belt of Wampum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the neck of Mishe-Mokwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Great Bear of the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the terror of the nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he lay asleep and cumbrous
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the summit of the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a rock with mosses on it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spotted brown and gray with mosses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently he stole upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the red nails of the monster
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost touched him, almost scared him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the hot breath of his nostrils
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he drew the Belt of Wampum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the round ears, that heard not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the small eyes, that saw not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the long nose and nostrils,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black muffle of the nostrils,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of which the heavy breathing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he swung aloft his war-club,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted loud and long his war-cry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote the mighty Mishe-Mokwa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right between the eyes he smote him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the heavy blow bewildered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose the Great Bear of the mountains;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his knees beneath him trembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he whimpered like a woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he reeled and staggered forward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sat upon his haunches;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing fearlessly before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taunted him in loud derision,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake disdainfully in this wise:--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hark you, Bear! you are a coward;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no Brave, as you pretended;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else you would not cry and whimper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a miserable woman!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear! you know our tribes are hostile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long have been at war together;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you find that we are strongest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You go sneaking in the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You go hiding in the mountains!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had you conquered me in battle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a groan would I have uttered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you, Bear! sit here and whimper,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And disgrace your tribe by crying,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wretched Shaugodaya,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a cowardly old woman!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again he raised his war-club,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote again the Mishe-Mokwa
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of his forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke his skull, as ice is broken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one goes to fish in Winter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was slain the Mishe-Mokwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the Great Bear of the mountains,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He the terror of the nations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor be to Mudjekeewis!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a shout exclaimed the people,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor be to Mudjekeewis!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth he shall be the West-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hereafter and forever
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall he hold supreme dominion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over all the winds of heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call him no more Mudjekeewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call him Kabeyun, the West-Wind!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus was Mudjekeewis chosen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father of the Winds of Heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For himself he kept the West-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave the others to his children;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto Wabun gave the East-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave the South to Shawondasee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the North-Wind, wild and cruel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fierce Kabibonokka.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young and beautiful was Wabun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who brought the morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was whose silver arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chased the dark o'er hill and valley;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was whose cheeks were painted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the brightest streaks of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whose voice awoke the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called the deer, and called the hunter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely in the sky was Wabun;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the birds sang gayly to him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the wild-flowers of the meadow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the air with odors for him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the forests and the rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang and shouted at his coming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still his heart was sad within him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he was alone in heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one morning, gazing earthward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the village still was sleeping,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fog lay on the river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a ghost, that goes at sunrise,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beheld a maiden walking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone upon a meadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering water-flags and rushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a river in the meadow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every morning, gazing earthward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the first thing he beheld there
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was her blue eyes looking at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two blue lakes among the rushes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he loved the lonely maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thus waited for his coming;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they both were solitary,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She on earth and he in heaven.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he wooed her with caresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wooed her with his smile of sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his flattering words he wooed her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his sighing and his singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentlest whispers in the branches,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softest music, sweetest odors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he drew her to his bosom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folded in his robes of crimson,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till into a star he changed her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling still upon his bosom;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And forever in the heavens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are seen together walking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wabun and the Wabun-Annung,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wabun and the Star of Morning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fierce Kabibonokka
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had his dwelling among icebergs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the everlasting snow-drifts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kingdom of Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the White Rabbit.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was whose hand in Autumn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted all the trees with scarlet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stained the leaves with red and yellow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who sent the snow-flake,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sifting, hissing through the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Froze the ponds, the lakes, the rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove the loon and sea-gull southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove the cormorant and curlew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their nests of sedge and sea-tang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the realms of Shawondasee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the fierce Kabibonokka
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issued from his lodge of snow-drifts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his home among the icebergs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his hair, with snow besprinkled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamed behind him like a river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a black and wintry river,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he howled and hurried southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over frozen lakes and moorlands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There among the reeds and rushes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found he Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trailing strings of fish behind him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the frozen fens and moorlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingering still among the moorlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though his tribe had long departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of Shawondasee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried the fierce Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is this that dares to brave me?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dares to stay in my dominions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Wawa has departed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wild-goose has gone southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago departed southward?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go into his wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put his smouldering fire out!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at night Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the lodge came wild and wailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaped the snow in drifts about it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted down into the smoke-flue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook the lodge-poles in his fury,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flapped the curtain of the door-way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shingebis, the diver, feared not,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shingebis, the diver, cared not;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four great logs had he for firewood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One for each moon of the winter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for food the fishes served him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his blazing fire he sat there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm and merry, eating, laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing, "O Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are but my fellow-mortal!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Kabibonokka entered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt his presence by the coldness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt his icy breath upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still he did not cease his singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still he did not leave his laughing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only turned the log a little,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only made the fire burn brighter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the sparks fly up the smoke-flue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Kabibonokka's forehead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his snow-besprinkled tresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drops of sweat fell fast and heavy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making dints upon the ashes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As along the eaves of lodges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from drooping boughs of hemlock,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drips the melting snow in spring-time,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making hollows in the snow-drifts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at last he rose defeated,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not bear the heat and laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not bear the merry singing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rushed headlong through the door-way,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamped upon the crusted snow-drifts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamped upon the lakes and rivers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the snow upon them harder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the ice upon them thicker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenged Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come forth and wrestle with him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come forth and wrestle naked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the frozen fens and moorlands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth went Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrestled all night with the North-Wind,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrestled naked on the moorlands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fierce Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his panting breath grew fainter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his frozen grasp grew feebler,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he reeled and staggered backward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And retreated, baffled, beaten,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kingdom of Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land of the White Rabbit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing still the gusty laughter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Shingebis, the diver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing, "O Kabibonokka,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are but my fellow-mortal!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawondasee, fat and lazy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had his dwelling far to southward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the drowsy, dreamy sunshine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the never-ending Summer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He it was who sent the wood-birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the robin, the Opechee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the bluebird, the Owaissa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the Shawshaw, sent the swallow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the wild-goose, Wawa, northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent the melons and tobacco,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grapes in purple clusters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his pipe the smoke ascending
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the sky with haze and vapor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled the air with dreamy softness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave a twinkle to the water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched the rugged hills with smoothness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought the tender Indian Summer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the melancholy north-land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dreary Moon of Snow-shoes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listless, careless Shawondasee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his life he had one shadow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart one sorrow had he.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, as he was gazing northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far away upon a prairie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beheld a maiden standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw a tall and slender maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All alone upon a prairie;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brightest green were all her garments,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her hair was like the sunshine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day he gazed upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day he sighed with passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day his heart within him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew more hot with love and longing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the maid with yellow tresses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was too fat and lazy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bestir himself and woo her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, too indolent and easy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pursue her and persuade her;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he only gazed upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only sat and sighed with passion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the maiden of the prairie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till one morning, looking northward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beheld her yellow tresses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed and covered o'er with whiteness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered as with whitest snow-flakes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! my brother from the North-land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the kingdom of Wabasso,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land of the White Rabbit!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have stolen the maiden from me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have laid your hand upon her,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have wooed and won my maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your stories of the North-land!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the wretched Shawondasee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathed into the air his sorrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the South-Wind o'er the prairie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandered warm with sighs of passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sighs of Shawondasee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the air seemed full of snow-flakes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of thistle-down the prairie,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the maid with hair like sunshine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished from his sight forever;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never more did Shawondasee
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the maid with yellow tresses!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor, deluded Shawondasee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was no woman that you gazed at,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was no maiden that you sighed for,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was the prairie dandelion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That through all the dreamy Summer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had gazed at with such longing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had sighed for with such passion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had puffed away forever,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown into the air with sighing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! deluded Shawondasee!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Four Winds were divided;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had their stations in the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corners of the heavens;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For himself the West-Wind only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis.

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O curfew of the setting sun!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Bells of Lynn!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O requiem of the dying day!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Bells of Lynn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the dark belfries of yon cloud-cathedral wafted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sounds aerial seem to float, O Bells of Lynn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne on the evening wind across the crimson twilight,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er land and sea they rise and fall, O Bells of Lynn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman in his boat, far out beyond the headland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listens, and leisurely rows ashore, O Bells of Lynn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the shining sands the wandering cattle homeward
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow each other at your call, O Bells of Lynn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant lighthouse hears, and with his flaming signal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answers you, passing the watchword on, O Bells of Lynn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the darkening coast run the tumultuous surges,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clap their hands, and shout to you, O Bells of Lynn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till from the shuddering sea, with your wild incantations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye summon up the spectral moon, O Bells of Lynn!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And startled at the sight like the weird woman of Endor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye cry aloud, and then are still, O Bells of Lynn!

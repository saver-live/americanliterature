<p>I WILL arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,<br> </p>
<p>And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:<br> </p>
<p>Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,<br> </p>
<p>And live alone in the bee-loud glade.<br> </p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,<br> </p>
<p>Dropping from the veils of the mourning to where the cricket sings;<br> </p>
<p>There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,<br> </p>
<p>And evening full of the linnet's wings.<br> </p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>I will arise and go now, for always night and day<br> </p>
<p>I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;<br> </p>
<p>While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,<br> </p>
<p>I hear it in the deep heart's core. <br> </p>

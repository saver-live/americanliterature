<p>I love Master Meng.<br> Free as a flowing breeze,<br> He is famous<br> Throughout the world.<br> <br> In rosy youth, he cast away<br> Official cap and carriage.<br> Now, a white-haired elder, he reclines<br> Amid pines and cloud.<br> <br> Drunk beneath the moon,<br> He often attains sagehood.<br> Lost among the flowers,<br> He serves no lord.<br> <br> How can I aspire<br> to such a high mountain?<br> Here below, to his clear fragrance,<br> I bow.<br> <br></p>

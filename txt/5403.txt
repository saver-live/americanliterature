<h2>Historical Background</h2><p> </p><p> </p><p>Published under the pseudonym, Clive Hamilton, Spirits in Bondage was C. S. Lewis' first book. Released in 1919 by Heinemann, it was reprinted in 1984 by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and included in Lewis' 1994 Collected Poems. It is the first of Lewis' major published works to enter the public domain in the United States. Readers should be aware that in other countries it may still be under copyright protection.</p><p>Most of the poems appear to have been written between 1915 and 1918, a period during which Lewis was a student under W. T. Kirkpatrick, a military trainee at Oxford, and a soldier serving in the trenches of World War I. Their outlook varies from Romantic expressions of love for the beauty and simplicity of nature to cynical statements about the presence of evil in this world. In a September 12, 1918 letter to his friend Arthur Greeves, Lewis said that his book was, "mainly strung around the idea that I mentioned to you before—that nature is wholly diabolical &amp; malevolent and that God, if he exists, is outside of and in opposition to the cosmic arrangements." In his cynical poems, Lewis is dealing with the same questions about evil in nature that Alfred Lord Tennyson explored from a position of troubled faith in "In Memoriam A. H." (Stanzas 54f). In a letter written perhaps to reassure his father, Lewis claimed, "You know who the God I blaspheme is and that it is not the God that you or I worship, or any other Christian." </p><p>Whatever Lewis believed at that time, the attitude in many of these poems is quite different from the attitude he expressed in his many Christian books from the 1930s on. Attempts in movies and on stage plays to portray Lewis as a sheltered professor who knew little about pain until the death of his wife late in life, have to deal not only with the many tragedies he experienced from a boy on, but also with the disturbing issues he faced in many of these early poems.</p><h2>Prologue</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Part I - The Prison House - I.

Ah, leave the world and come away! The windy folk are in the glade, And men have seen their revels, laid In secret on some flowery lawn Underneath the beechen covers, Kings of old, I've heard them say, Here have found them faerie lovers That charmed them out of life and kissed Their lips with cold lips unafraid, And such a spell around them made That they have passed beyond the mist And found the Country-under-wave. . . . Kings of old, whom none could save!  </p><h2>XXX - Oxford</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>XXXI - Hymn (For Boys' Voices)</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>XXXII - "Our Daily Bread"</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>XXXIII - How He Saw Angus the God</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>XXXIV - The Roads</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>XXXV - Hesperus</h2><p> </p><p> <img class="img-fluid" style="float:right; margin-left: 20px;" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/hesperus.jpg" alt="XXXV - Hesperus from Spirits in Bondage" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1692159536" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p><h2>XXXVI - The Star Bath</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>XXXVII - Tu Ne Quaesieris</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>XXXVIII - Lullaby</h2><p> </p><p> <img class="img-fluid" style="float:right; margin-left: 20px;" src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/book/lullaby.jpg" alt="XXXVIII - Lullaby from Spirits in Bondage" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3219215634" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"> </p><h2>XXXIX - World's Desire</h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>XL - Death in Battle</h2><p> </p><p> </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, the handsome Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom the people called the Storm-Fool,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vexed the village with disturbance;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall hear of all his mischief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his flight from Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his wondrous transmigrations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the end of his adventures.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shores of Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shining Big-Sea-Water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the lodge of Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was he who in his frenzy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirled these drifting sands together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, among the guests assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He so merrily and madly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced at Hiawatha's wedding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danced the Beggar's Dance to please them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in search of new adventures,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his lodge went Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came with speed into the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found the young men all assembled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lodge of old Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to his monstrous stories,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his wonderful adventures.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was telling them the story
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Ojeeg, the Summer-Maker,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he made a hole in heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he climbed up into heaven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let out the summer-weather,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perpetual, pleasant Summer;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Otter first essayed it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Beaver, Lynx, and Badger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried in turn the great achievement,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the summit of the mountain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote their fists against the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smote against the sky their foreheads,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cracked the sky, but could not break it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Wolverine, uprising,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made him ready for the encounter,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent his knees down, like a squirrel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew his arms back, like a cricket.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once he leaped," said old Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once he leaped, and lo! above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent the sky, as ice in rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the waters rise beneath it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice he leaped, and lo! above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cracked the sky, as ice in rivers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the freshet is at highest!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice he leaped, and lo! above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke the shattered sky asunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he disappeared within it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ojeeg, the Fisher Weasel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bound went in behind him!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hark you!" shouted Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he entered at the doorway;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am tired of all this talking,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired of old Iagoo's stories,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired of Hiawatha's wisdom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is something to amuse you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better than this endless talking."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from out his pouch of wolf-skin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth he drew, with solemn manner,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the game of Bowl and Counters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pugasaing, with thirteen pieces.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White on one side were they painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vermilion on the other;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Kenabeeks or great serpents,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Ininewug or wedge-men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One great war-club, Pugamaugun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one slender fish, the Keego,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four round pieces, Ozawabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three Sheshebwug or ducklings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were made of bone and painted,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All except the Ozawabeeks;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were brass, on one side burnished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And were black upon the other.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a wooden bowl he placed them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook and jostled them together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw them on the ground before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus exclaiming and explaining:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red side up are all the pieces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one great Kenabeek standing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bright side of a brass piece,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a burnished Ozawabeek;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen tens and eight are counted."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again he shook the pieces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook and jostled them together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw them on the ground before him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still exclaiming and explaining:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"White are both the great Kenabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White the Ininewug, the wedge-men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red are all the other pieces;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five tens and an eight are counted."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he taught the game of hazard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus displayed it and explained it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running through its various chances,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various changes, various meanings:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty curious eyes stared at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of eagerness stared at him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many games," said old Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many games of skill and hazard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I seen in different nations,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I played in different countries.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who plays with old Iagoo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must have very nimble fingers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you think yourself so skilful,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can beat you, Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can even give you lessons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your game of Bowl and Counters!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they sat and played together,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the old men and the young men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played for dresses, weapons, wampum,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played till midnight, played till morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played until the Yenadizze,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their treasures had despoiled them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the best of all their dresses,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirts of deer-skin, robes of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belts of wampum, crests of feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warlike weapons, pipes and pouches.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty eyes glared wildly at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eyes of wolves glared at him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the lucky Pau-Puk-Keewis:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my wigwam I am lonely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my wanderings and adventures
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have need of a companion,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fain would have a Meshinauwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An attendant and pipe-bearer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will venture all these winnings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these garments heaped about me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this wampum, all these feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a single throw will venture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All against the young man yonder!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was a youth of sixteen summers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was a nephew of Iagoo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face-in-a-Mist, the people called him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the fire burns in a pipe-head
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dusky red beneath the ashes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So beneath his shaggy eyebrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowed the eyes of old Iagoo.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh!" he answered very fiercely;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ugh!" they answered all and each one.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized the wooden bowl the old man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closely in his bony fingers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clutched the fatal bowl, Onagon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook it fiercely and with fury,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the pieces ring together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he threw them down before him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red were both the great Kenabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red the Ininewug, the wedge-men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red the Sheshebwug, the ducklings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black the four brass Ozawabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White alone the fish, the Keego;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only five the pieces counted!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the smiling Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook the bowl and threw the pieces;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightly in the air he tossed them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they fell about him scattered;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark and bright the Ozawabeeks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red and white the other pieces,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upright among the others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Ininewug was standing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as crafty Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood alone among the players,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "Five tens! mine the game is!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty eyes glared at him fiercely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eyes of wolves glared at him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he turned and left the wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed by his Meshinauwa,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the nephew of Iagoo,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the tall and graceful stripling,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in his arms the winnings,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirts of deer-skin, robes of ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belts of wampum, pipes and weapons.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carry them," said Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing with his fan of feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To my wigwam far to eastward,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot and red with smoke and gambling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the eyes of Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he came forth to the freshness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the pleasant Summer morning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the birds were singing gayly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the streamlets flowing swiftly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heart of Pau-Puk-Keewis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang with pleasure as the birds sing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat with triumph like the streamlets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he wandered through the village,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early gray of morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fan of turkey-feathers,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his plumes and tufts of swan's down,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he reached the farthest wigwam,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reached the lodge of Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent was it and deserted;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one met him at the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one came to bid him welcome;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the birds were singing round it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out and round the doorway,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopping, singing, fluttering, feeding,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And aloft upon the ridge-pole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat with fiery eyes, and, screaming,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flapped his wings at Pau-Puk-Keewis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are gone! the lodge is empty!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was spake Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his heart resolving mischief;--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gone is wary Hiawatha,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone the silly Laughing Water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone Nokomis, the old woman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lodge is left unguarded!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the neck he seized the raven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirled it round him like a rattle,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a medicine-pouch he shook it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangled Kahgahgee, the raven,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ridge-pole of the wigwam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left its lifeless body hanging,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an insult to its master,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a taunt to Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a stealthy step he entered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the lodge in wild disorder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw the household things about him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piled together in confusion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowls of wood and earthen kettles,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robes of buffalo and beaver,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skins of otter, lynx, and ermine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an insult to Nokomis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a taunt to Minnehaha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then departed Pau-Puk-Keewis,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling, singing through the forest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whistling gayly to the squirrels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from hollow boughs above him
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropped their acorn-shells upon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing gayly to the wood birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who from out the leafy darkness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered with a song as merry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he climbed the rocky headlands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking o'er the Gitche Gumee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched himself upon their summit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting full of mirth and mischief
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return of Hiawatha.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched upon his back he lay there;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far below him plashed the waters,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plashed and washed the dreamy waters;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far above him swam the heavens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swam the dizzy, dreamy heavens;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round him hovered, fluttered, rustled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiawatha's mountain chickens,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flock-wise swept and wheeled about him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost brushed him with their pinions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he killed them as he lay there,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaughtered them by tens and twenties,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw their bodies down the headland,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw them on the beach below him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at length Kayoshk, the sea-gull,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched upon a crag above them,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted: "It is Pau-Puk-Keewis!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is slaying us by hundreds!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send a message to our brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tidings send to Hiawatha!"

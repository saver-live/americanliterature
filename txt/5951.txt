<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TORQUEMADA

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heroic days when Ferdinand
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Isabella ruled the Spanish land,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Torquemada, with his subtle brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruled them, as Grand Inquisitor of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a great castle near Valladolid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moated and high and by fair woodlands hid,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There dwelt as from the chronicles we learn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old Hidalgo proud and taciturn,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose name has perished, with his towers of stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his actions save this one alone;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one, so terrible, perhaps 't were best
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it, too, were forgotten with the rest;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, perchance, our eyes can see therein
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The martyrdom triumphant o'er the sin;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A double picture, with its gloom and glow,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendor overhead, the death below.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sombre man counted each day as lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which his feet no sacred threshold crossed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he chanced the passing Host to meet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knelt and prayed devoutly in the street;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft he confessed; and with each mutinous thought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with wild beasts at Ephesus, he fought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deep contrition scourged himself in Lent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked in processions, with his head down bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At plays of Corpus Christi oft was seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on Palm Sunday bore his bough of green.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sole diversion was to hunt the boar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through tangled thickets of the forest hoar,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or with his jingling mules to hurry down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some grand bull-fight in the neighboring town,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in the crowd with lighted taper stand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jews were burned, or banished from the land.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then stirred within him a tumultuous joy;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon whose delight is to destroy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shook him, and shouted with a trumpet tone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill! kill! and let the Lord find out his own!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, in that old castle in the wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughters, in the dawn of womanhood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning from their convent school, had made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resplendent with their bloom the forest shade,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminding him of their dead mother's face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first she came into that gloomy place,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A memory in his heart as dim and sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As moonlight in a solitary street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the same rays, that lift the sea, are thrown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely but powerless upon walls of stone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two fair daughters of a mother dead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were all the dream had left him as it fled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A joy at first, and then a growing care,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a voice within him cried, "Beware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vague presentiment of impending doom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like ghostly footsteps in a vacant room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunted him day and night; a formless fear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That death to some one of his house was near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dark surmises of a hidden crime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made life itself a death before its time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous, suspicious, with no sense of shame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spy upon his daughters he became;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With velvet slippers, noiseless on the floors,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glided softly through half-open doors;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the room, and now upon the stair,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood beside them ere they were aware;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened in the passage when they talked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched them from the casement when they walked,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the gypsy haunt the river's side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the monk among the cork-trees glide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, tortured by the mystery and the doubt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some dark secret, past his finding out,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baffled he paused; then reassured again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursued the flying phantom of his brain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched them even when they knelt in church;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, descending lower in his search,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questioned the servants, and with eager eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listened incredulous to their replies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gypsy? none had seen her in the wood!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk? a mendicant in search of food!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length the awful revelation came,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crushing at once his pride of birth and name;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hopes his yearning bosom forward cast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ancestral glories of the vast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fell together, crumbling in disgrace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A turret rent from battlement to base.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughters talking in the dead of night
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their own chamber, and without a light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening, as he was wont, he overheard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learned the dreadful secret, word by word;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurrying from his castle, with a cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hands to the unpitying sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeating one dread word, till bush and tree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught it, and shuddering answered, "Heresy!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in his cloak, his hat drawn o'er his face,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now hurrying forward, now with lingering pace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked all night the alleys of his park,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one unseen companion in the dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Demon who within him lay in wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by his presence turned his love to hate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever muttering in an undertone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill! kill! and let the Lord find out his own!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the morrow, after early Mass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet the dew was glistening on the grass,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the woods were musical with birds,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Hidalgo, uttering fearful words,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walked homeward with the Priest, and in his room
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summoned his trembling daughters to their doom.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When questioned, with brief answers they replied,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor when accused evaded or denied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expostulations, passionate appeals,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that the human heart most fears or feels,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain the Priest with earnest voice essayed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain the father threatened, wept, and prayed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last he said, with haughty mien,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Office, then, must intervene!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the Grand Inquisitor of Spain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the fifty horsemen of his train,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His awful name resounding, like the blast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of funeral trumpets, as he onward passed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to Valladolid, and there began
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To harry the rich Jews with fire and ban.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him the Hidalgo went, and at the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demanded audience on affairs of state,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a secret chamber stood before
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A venerable graybeard of fourscore,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed in the hood and habit of a friar;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of his eyes flashed a consuming fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his hand the mystic horn he held,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which poison and all noxious charms dispelled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard in silence the Hidalgo's tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then answered in a voice that made him quail:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son of the Church! when Abraham of old
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sacrifice his only son was told,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pause to parley nor protest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hastened to obey the Lord's behest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In him it was accounted righteousness;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Church expects of thee no less!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sacred frenzy seized the father's brain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mercy from that hour implored in vain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! who will e'er believe the words I say?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughters he accused, and the same day
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both were cast into the dungeon's gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dismal antechamber of the tomb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arraigned, condemned, and sentenced to the flame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret torture and the public shame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the Grand Inquisitor once more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hidalgo went, more eager than before,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "When Abraham offered up his son,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clave the wood wherewith it might be done.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his example taught, let me too bring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood from the forest for my offering!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the deep voice, without a pause, replied:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son of the Church! by faith now justified,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete thy sacrifice, even as thou wilt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church absolves thy conscience from all guilt!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this most wretched father went his way
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the woods, that round his castle lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where once his daughters in their childhood played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their young mother in the sun and shade.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all the leaves had fallen; the branches bare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made a perpetual moaning in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And screaming from their eyries overhead
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ravens sailed athwart the sky of lead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his own hands he lopped the boughs and bound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fagots, that crackled with foreboding sound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on his mules, caparisoned and gay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bells and tassels, sent them on their way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with his mind on one dark purpose bent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again to the Inquisitor he went,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "Behold, the fagots I have brought,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, lest my atonement be as naught,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant me one more request, one last desire,--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my own hand to light the funeral fire!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Torquemada answered from his seat,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son of the Church!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine offering is complete;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her servants through all ages shall not cease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To magnify thy deed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depart in peace!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the market-place, builded of stone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scaffold rose, whereon Death claimed his own.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the four corners, in stern attitude,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four statues of the Hebrew Prophets stood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing with calm indifference in their eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon this place of human sacrifice,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round which was gathering fast the eager crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With clamor of voices dissonant and loud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every roof and window was alive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With restless gazers, swarming like a hive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church-bells tolled, the chant of monks drew near,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line of torches smoked along the street,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a stir, a rush, a tramp of feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with its banners floating in the air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly the long procession crossed the square,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, to the statues of the Prophets bound,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims stood, with fagots piled around.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all the air a blast of trumpets shook,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And louder sang the monks with bell and book,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Hidalgo, lofty, stern, and proud,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifted his torch, and, bursting through the crowd,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted in haste the fagots, and then fled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest those imploring eyes should strike him dead!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O pitiless skies! why did your clouds retain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For peasants' fields their floods of hoarded rain?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O pitiless earth! why open no abyss
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bury in its chasm a crime like this?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night a mingled column of fire and smoke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prom the dark thickets of the forest broke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, glaring o'er the landscape leagues away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made all the fields and hamlets bright as day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapped in a sheet of flame the castle blazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the villagers in terror gazed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the figure of that cruel knight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean from a window in the turret's height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ghastly face illumined with the glare,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hands upraised above his head in prayer,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the floor sank beneath him, and he fell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the black hollow of that burning well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three centuries and more above his bones
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have piled the oblivious years like funeral stones;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name has perished with him, and no trace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remains on earth of his afflicted race;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Torquemada's name, with clouds o'ercast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looms in the distant landscape of the Past,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a burnt tower upon a blackened heath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit by the fires of burning woods beneath!



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERLUDE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus closed the tale of guilt and gloom,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cast upon each listener's face
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its shadow, and for some brief space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbroken silence filled the room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jew was thoughtful and distressed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his memory thronged and pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persecution of his race,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wrongs and sufferings and disgrace;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head was sunk upon his breast,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from his eyes alternate came
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashes of wrath and tears of shame.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student first the silence broke,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who long has lain in wait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With purpose to retaliate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus he dealt the avenging stroke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In such a company as this,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale so tragic seems amiss,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That by its terrible control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ermasters and drags down the soul
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a fathomless abyss.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Italian Tales that you disdain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some merry Night of Straparole,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Machiavelli's Belphagor,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would cheer us and delight us more,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give greater pleasure and less pain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than your grim tragedies of Spain!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here the Poet raised his hand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such entreaty and command,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stopped discussion at its birth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said: "The story I shall tell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has meaning in it, if not mirth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, and hear what once befell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merry birds of Killingworth!"
